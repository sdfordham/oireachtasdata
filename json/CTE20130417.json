The joint committee will have received our executive summary, which I will read through and may add to.  I am accompanied today by Ms Ann O'Mahony, who works with me in the qualifications, curriculum and assessment section, Mr. Paul Caffrey from the inspectorate, who is also a specialist in the languages area, and Ms Gr&aacute;inne Morrissey from the higher education division.<\/p><p>  At primary level, the focus is on the acquisition of the two national languages, English and Irish.  Beyond primary level, the focus expands to include not only English and Irish but other languages, which I will elaborate on later.  As the purpose of today's discussion is multilingualism in an EU context, I will start with that issue.  It is more than 12 years since the Barcelona European Council meeting identified language competencies as an essential component of a competitive knowledge-based economy.  The EU has advocated that education systems seek to promote competency in the mother tongue plus two foreign languages from an early age.  In Ireland, Irish and English are national languages and both are taught at primary and second level.  Accordingly, while the vast majority of students in Ireland study three languages at second level, only the third language is counted in this European indicator of foreign languages.  Ten years on from the Barcelona European Council, the Commission's communication, Rethinking Education: Investing in Skills for Better Socioeconomic Outcomes, published last November, again emphasised the importance of language learning, particularly for jobs and mobility.<\/p><p>  The latest edition of the Eurobarometer special report on Europeans' foreign language competencies and attitudes to foreign languages, which was published last June, showed that Ireland had registered a notable increase since the previous report in 2006 in the number of respondents who indicated they could speak at least one or two foreign languages well enough to hold a conversation.  While we are dealing with languages in the context of the EU, it is important also to note that such an approach is promoted by the Council of Europe, which advocates plurilingualism.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with the national language strategy.  Last year, a report by the expert group on future skills needs, Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally, recommended the development of a national language strategy with a five to ten-year horizon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Naughton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366200300,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Naughton and her colleagues from the Department of Education and Skills.  She outlined the current policies for improving the language capacity of students and the wider population.  Significant issues have arisen recently in regard to the foreign language capacity required for some of the jobs that have been attracted to this country.  PayPal received particular attention when it publicised the lack of capacity in this country to fill the roles it had created.  We have to ensure our education system allows people to become proficient in languages which can benefit them in terms of getting jobs.  I note that the recent Eurobarometer survey found that the figures had improved compared to 2006.  I ask for more detail regarding how they have improved, the current figures and where they leave us in comparison to our European counterparts.<\/p><p>  In regard to the potential for junior certificate reform to develop language capacity among students at second level, what are the plans in this regard?  Students currently study foreign languages for the junior certificate.  How will the proposed changes assist in developing their language capacity further?<\/p><p>  The modern languages in primary schools initiative was introduced on a pilot basis in 1998 but was discontinued by the Minister last year.  The initiative was shown to have an impact in terms of increasing uptake and interest in modern languages in participating schools.  It was a short-sighted approach by the Minister to cut rather than expand an apparently effective initiative.  Just 4% of primary school students have an opportunity to study a modern language.  In many cases it is only at secondary level that students first engage with a foreign language.  Evidence suggests that the younger a student engages with a modern language, the greater the capacity and the gr&aacute; that will develop.<\/p><p>  A considerable amount of time is devoted to Irish at primary level.  It is well documented that the results are not as good as they could be.  Is the Department considering any initiatives for improving outcomes given the amount of time dedicated to Irish?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700004#D00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1366200300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue spoke about the modern language initiative.

The teaching of languages is an area of considerable interest to many and I welcome the opportunity to shine a light on it at the committee.  There is a prevailing attitude to the teaching of French in our secondary schools.  Does the Department review this approach?  Why are we not teaching more German?  Have we reviewed the approach to the teaching of languages from the BRICS countries and other emerging markets.  Up to 30% of students study languages at third level.  How does Ireland compare to other EU member states and other countries for language uptake at third level?<\/p><p>  There was some debate during the general election about the compulsory teaching of Irish in schools.  Has the Department a view on compulsory Irish for the leaving certificate?  I feel very strongly about this.  From my experience of teaching, I believe compulsory Irish is its own worst enemy and does not help the teaching of the language.  People should be allowed to do it themselves by their own choice.<\/p><p>  The other bugbear of mine is the teaching of Irish.  It has been a significant challenge to the State over time and to those teaching it.  My four children were fluent in a second language before they went to school because their mother had a second language.  From listening to it in the home, they picked it up quickly and became fluent speakers.  It is a bugbear for me then that children spend 16 years in school but come out illiterate in Irish.  I believed one of the problems was teaching people to read in the language.  While I accept teaching methods have progressed, every language should be learned through speaking first and then reading and spelling can come afterwards.  What is the Department&rsquo;s view on the teaching of Irish in primary schools and lower-stream classes?  Will the officials also elaborate on the teaching of Chinese in schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700005#E00300","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366200900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue asked how the junior cycle reform will assist language capacity in the schools.  In the new junior cycle we have set down statements of learning which describe what the students should know, understand and value at the end of their junior cycle.  Two of these statements are that they would be able to communicate in the school&rsquo;s first language, be it English or Irish, and have a level of proficiency in another language, appropriate to their particular ability.  All children will study English and Irish but they will also have an opportunity to study a foreign language.  That could be either as a full subject or a new short course of 100 hours.<\/p><p>  The NCCA is preparing a short course in Chinese.  Before, the first opportunity students had to learn the language was through a transition year module.  From 2014, they will have an opportunity to study it through a short course.  Schools can also develop short courses.  This would be helpful to those schools with a high proportion of migrants.  For example, we now have 700 young people doing Polish for the leaving certificate.  A school may offer short courses in languages where there is a demand for them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien referred to learning a language at school just to get the grade.  I know he is a bit younger than me but when I was in school it was all about learning theorems, geometry and poems by heart for the grade too.  We did not have a clue.  I remember going to Brussels airport with my parents.  They were delighted with me when I asked where to get a taxi in French.  However, when the man replied, I had not a clue what he was saying.  Today, there is a greater approach to learning a language orally and using it in real-life situations.  With the new junior cycle, the assessment emphasis will be changed.  It will be an assessment for learning that happened throughout the students experience in the three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700005#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Naughton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366201500,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I was interested to hear Deputy O'Brien's comment on the learning of French.  In a newspaper recently a parent asked how it is that a person who gets a B at higher level French cannot go into a shop and ask for a loaf of bread.  The parent finished by saying that instead of taking down lists of French verbs and writing postcards to imaginary pen-friends, pupils should spend their time in class speaking and chatting in French and trying out their skills.  I hope schools harness new technologies, such as Skype, in imaginative ways to expose students to the real business of language expression and communication rather than the current business of getting through the leaving certificate exam.<\/p><p>  As an inspector, I am aware of the challenge there is in moving from the traditional style, which in the worst case scenario is based on teaching through English, with a heavy, grammar-translation approach.  However, we also see very exciting things happening in terms of communicative language teaching and the move is in that direction and technology is helping.  I was in a school in west Dublin last year where I saw a fifth year second level group Skype colleagues in an exchange school in the north of Italy.  This is happening.  The post primary languages initiative has, through its website, made some very good video clips available to encourage teachers to teach more through the target language.  There is also a Facebook page promoting this.  There is a move in that direction.<\/p><p>  It is important to point out that assessment can sometimes be the tail that wags the dog.  The oral examination at junior certificate level is optional currently and most schools do not do it.  This is detrimental in terms of discouraging a truly communicative teaching approach.  However, this is changing and some schools are offering a junior certificate oral, prioritising an oral exam.  The situation is similar with regard to Irish and now 40% of the marks go to the leaving certificate oral exam.  Both teachers and students would say there has been a definite shift in emphasis towards a more communicative style of teaching.  When inspectors are in classrooms, this is one of the key factors they consider, at both primary and post-primary level.  They are looking to see whether the style of teaching is communicative and whether material is being taught through the target language.<\/p><p>  Students must also have the real opportunity to use the language.  Learning a language is not like being given a body of knowledge to be retained.  It is more like learning to drive a car or play a sport.  Often students do not get the opportunity to practise and it can be difficult in a big class to create real communicative opportunities.  A movement called content and language integrated learning, CLIL, simply means teaching another subject through Irish, French or whatever.  This used to happen to a significant extent, particularly in primary schools in the past when subjects like music, art or history were taught through Irish.  The same could be done through French or another foreign language if we had teachers who were graduates in a language and another subject.  Transition year provides a possibility for this.  Unless students are given opportunities to use the language in a communicative way, either through technology, group work in class or through using the language for everyday communication outside of the language class, the pull of simply being satisfied with being able to tick the boxes and do the right things in the exam is huge.<\/p><p>  Unless there are opportunities to practice, there is no language development.  That is the reason many of us here for example, who had very good levels of Irish, French or whatever leaving school, would find it difficult to conduct the business of this committee through that language.  That is simply because we are out of practice.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Caffrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366201500,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms. O'Mahony to speak now about the Eurobarometer and the language initiative at primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Naughton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366201500,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The Eurobarometer is one of a series of periodic surveys carried out by the European Commission on Europeans and their languages.  The current barometer is the third in the series.  The first was in 2001, the second in 2006 and the current one was conducted in 2012.  The key findings of the survey reveal that Europeans have a very positive attitude towards multilingualism.  Almost all Europeans, 98%, think that mastering a foreign language is useful for their children's future and 88% see it as useful for themselves.  Almost three quarters, 72%, agree with the EU objective that everybody should learn at least two foreign languages.  Some 77% think that improvement in language skills should be a policy priority and 67% see English as one of the two most useful languages for themselves.  Among the others most frequently cited as useful are: German, 17%; French, 16%; Spanish, 14%; and Chinese, 6%.<\/p><p>  With regard to some of the other figures, countries showing the most noticeable increase in the proportion of respondents saying they can speak at least one foreign language well enough to hold a conversation compared to data from the 2006 survey are: Austria, up 16 percentage points to 78%; Finland, up six percentage points to 75%; and Ireland, up six percentage points to 40%.  Very few countries show a notable increase in the proportion of respondents able to speak at least two foreign languages, with the most marked being Italy, up six percentage points to 22% and Ireland, up five percentage points to 18%.  I wonder whether immigrant populations play a role in this, but it is certainly a positive finding.  That said, there are also negative findings.  Countries where respondents are least likely to be able to speak any foreign language are Hungary, 65%, Italy, 62%, the UK and Portugal, 61% and Ireland, 60%.   It is certainly not all a rosy picture.<\/p><p>  While on the issue of the Eurobarometer survey, Deputy Griffin asked what people were doing with the languages they acquired at second and third level.  This survey address that.  Page 54 contains a list of what people do with their languages, including, holidays abroad and watching films or television.

A wide range of languages are available across the higher education sector.  There is no indication that capacity constraints would hinder us in increasing provision if demand were to increase.  We can also develop targeted responses to particular enterprise and foreign language skills needs through initiatives such as Springboard.  If we increase provision in the absence of increased demand, we will not address any skills gap.  We provided almost 130 places on foreign language courses under Springboard in 2012.  They were to be provided through seven programmes, but three of the programmes were not ultimately offered because there was insufficient demand for them from students.<\/p><p>  Deputy Jim Daly also asked about the number of people studying languages at third level.  We know that the number studying a foreign language as a single subject increased by approximately 13% between 2007 and 2010.  The HEA's data returns do not capture those students who study languages as part of a degree in which it is not the main subject.  The HEA is undertaking research to address this by trying to quantify the full extent of language provision across the higher education sector.  Preliminary data from this exercise indicate that approximately 9,000 students are studying a foreign language as a core subject or module as part of their degrees.  The increasing modularisation of higher education programmes will provide more opportunities for students to take languages as part of other degrees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gr&aacute;inne Morrissey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366202100,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Students have opportunities to study abroad under the Erasmus programme.

I do not have details of the initiatives brought forward to promote it, but I can give the committee some statistics.  In 2001 some 16.5% of all leaving certificate candidates sat a German paper.  The equivalent figure for French at the time was 60%.  French has traditionally been the dominant foreign language, primarily for historical reasons.  After German reached the 16% level in 2001, it reduced to 15% in 2006 and 12% last year.  French has witnessed a greater decline, in terms of the percentage of the total cohort taking it.  Spanish and Italian have seen increases.  Some German cultural institutions - the Goethe-Institut, the German Embassy and some German businesses - have launched a campaign to promote German as a language offering opportunities in second level education.  They have produced a CD-ROM and a website, etc.  Based on my experience of visiting schools, my feeling is that German, like other lesser taught languages, has had to fight its corner to some extent.  It is rarely the default foreign language in a school.  If German is still offered in a school, despite the pressure it faces as a subject, it is probably because it is well taught.  I have seen some excellent teaching of German in schools.  I appreciate the commitment of the Goethe-Institut and other bodies.<\/p><p>  The languages offered in a school depend on the existing capacity within the school.  A school cannot offer a language unless there is a teacher in it with the qualification and the ability to teach it.  A far-seeing principal or board of management might decide to diversify the school's offering.  A school that has traditionally taught French may decide to teach another language.  The post-primary languages initiative helped many schools to introduce Spanish, Japanese, Russian or Italian.  A certain degree of foresight is needed if a school is to take the initiative in this regard.  It is difficult to judge these matters so far in advance.  It should really be a matter for national policy.  Each individual school chooses what to offer from the curriculum, which is a type of menu.  This approach, whereby schools are given a high level of autonomy in deciding what to offer, is not going to change.  The only way it could change would be if we decided we needed a certain capacity in certain languages.  The BRICS countries have been mentioned in this regard.  The only way the Department could ensure such a change of approach was implemented would be to provide <i>ex quota<\/i> teachers for these subjects and that is not going to happen in the current climate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700007#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Caffrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366202100,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Deputy Jim Daly also asked how often we reviewed approaches to languages.  It is an area in which we are very active.  We are examining the development of the curriculum at primary level.  We are dealing with junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class.  The curriculums are mirror images of each other.  That makes it easier or more probable that teachers will be able to deal with and support one language alongside another.  That is happening and materials are being prepared.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is very involved in consultations about what is being done at various stages.  The English curriculum is also being reviewed.  That will go out for consultation very shortly.  When the Irish curriculum is reviewed next year, that will go out for consultation also.  A background paper which will go out for consultation is being prepared.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is trying to work on a consultative basis.  It publishes material relating to each area in which it is working on its website and people can respond to it.  That is what is being done at primary level.  At post-primary level, the English and Irish junior cycle curriculums are being examined.  Modern languages will be examined in 2016 and the short Chinese course should be ready for September 2014.  Some consideration has been given to the senior cycle language programmes, but they are having to wait in line in the context of the significant amount of work being done in priority areas of the junior cycle programme such as literacy, numeracy, English and Irish.

I have young children who watch television programmes such as \"Dora the Explorer\" and \"Handy Manny\", and they are picking up bits and pieces of Spanish just from watching television and interacting.  It is probably the way to go.  If we are serious about teaching languages that are going to be used beyond education in the workforce, we have to change the way we are teaching and learning them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700008#H01100","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1366202700,"counter":37,"content":"<p>On that point, while I was never very good at languages at school, what I found most off-putting was the teaching of different tenses.

I saw a first-year class which I thought was unduly heavy in terms of grammatical input so I told the teacher when talking outside in the lobby that there would be plenty of time for that.  The children's English grammar is muddled but nobody cares because they know exactly what the children want to say and they are making themselves understood.  There is a time later on when the grammar and the rules are introduced in the context of communication.  That is the direction in which we are trying to move things, with some success.  We see quite a range, from very good communicative teaching, where the lesson from beginning to end is conducted in Spanish, Irish, French and so on, to the other extreme, where there is an imbalance of grammar at an unduly early stage, with students copying down lists of words and so on.  That is changing, however, and we are certainly encouraging the change.<\/p><p>  The new media are helping in this regard and I encourage committee members to look the website <i>languagesinitiative.ie<\/i>, which is the website of the post-primary languages initiative.  It gives good examples and is a place where students and teachers are interacting, sharing source materials and so on.  It is a move that is happening, although it is certainly taking time. <\/p><p>  I believe the new junior cycle framework will help a lot because there will be more of an emphasis on learning outcomes and &quot;can do&quot; statements.  This means, for example, that the student knows at the beginning of the year that, by Christmas, he or she will be able to do certain communicative things in the language, such as ask someone their name, be able to spell and so on.  There will also be greater emphasis on assessment for learning so, rather than waiting for a written exam at the end of three years and focusing on that, there will be a continuous assessment of all the language skills, with a prioritising of oral language.  That is certainly the way we are moving and I am seeing that change happening in schools.  A change of that magnitude takes time but I believe it is happening and I see very good examples of it happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700008#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Caffrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1366202700,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Are there any other questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013041700008#H01400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1366202700,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I am very heartened by today's contribution from our guests.

We understand that the committee has received a lot of requests to speak from interested parties on the subject of the climate action and low carbon development Bill, so we are grateful for the opportunity to contribute an international perspective to the committee's ongoing work. We spent the last two days in Dublin Castle at the Hunger, Nutrition and Climate Justice conference hosted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice.  It was a remarkable event in many ways, not least because of the participation of so many organisations from communities around the globe who are dealing with and adapting to the impacts of climate change.  Three of those partners are with us today to share with the committee their experience of the impacts of a changing climate and the committee will hear from them shortly.  I was fortunate to have been a participant as well.  By way of some opening remarks, I would like to share with the committee three observations from the conference.  The first is the urgency of the issue.  Hearing first-hand accounts of failing crops brought about by prolonged drought or torrential rain washing away soils and seeds was a reminder to all of us there that climate change is happening and is causing devastation for millions of people around the world.  It is challenging the very existence of communities dependent on the land for their existence, is disproportionately affecting women and children and is threatening to set back by years the development gains made by developing countries over the last two decades.  As former US Vice President Al Gore remarked at the conference, opening the newspaper or hearing the news these days is like taking a nature walk through the Book of Revelation.  Yesterday, we heard from my colleague, Mr. Mithika Mwenda, that 36 Kenyans had lost their lives in floods across the country.  It was all the more moving and telling that many of these places that were suffering from flooding traditionally suffer from droughts.  Now it is floods that are taking the lives of people.  Rachel Kyte, a vice president at the World Bank, described at the conference how in some parts of the globe, extreme weather events that used to happen once every 100 years are now happening  as often as every five or six years. Crucially, the time between these extreme weather events is insufficient for communities to recover.  They are being hit with a fresh weather event before they have had time to get back on their feet, setting their development back two or three years at a time and undermining all the good work that has been done up to that point.<\/p><p>  The second observation I made was the incredible innovation, intelligence and resilience that communities, villages and individuals are continuing to show in the face of these stark challenges.  A focus of the conference was to record and exchange the adaptation experience of partners in different situations.  There was a complete global reach from the Arctic circle down to the Pacific islands and we heard some hugely impressive accounts from people who have responded and changed the way they have worked the land to adapt to a changing climate.  Of course, none of that innovation will mean anything if the planet continues on its current emissions pathway, which, at the moment, will bring us to a 6-degree warming by the end of the century.  All the development gains and all the creative responses to climate change are in danger of being washed away by flooding and storms or blown away in a massive dust bowl.<\/p><p>  This brings me to my third observation.  While there was a wealth of discussion and a rich exchange of views between policy makers and communities at the coalface about ways of adapting to the changing climate and challenges with regard to food security and nutrition, there was less, indeed very little, discussion about the bigger issues - or the elephant in the room, as I heard it being referred to on more than one occasion.  The elephant in the room was, and is, the role and responsibility of industrialised countries to address climate change.  It is a fact that industrialised countries need to dramatically reduce their emissions in line with what the science tells us if we are to have any chance of keeping below a 2&deg;C rise.  Even a 2&deg;C rise will have massive implications for many developing countries.  I know some of our partner organisations believe 2&deg;C is too high and that the figure needs to be 1.5&deg;C or below.  The other elephant in the room was that rich countries have yet to honour their commitments made under the UNFCCC to provide new money - and by \"new\", we do not mean aid money repackaged and recycled as climate money.  Countries need that money to help them adapt to climate change and scale up local adaptation projects.  It is, as was mentioned by some of the participants, a question of justice.  It was the actions of the countries of the industrialised north that caused climate change, and they and we bear an historical responsibility for creating climate change that needs to be acknowledged and acted on.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in his brief appearance at the conference, acknowledged as much when he noted that it is those who did least to create climate change who are suffering the worst consequences.  It is not the first time I have heard the Minister say that and it is an important reality and worth repeating.  Action on climate change is a question of justice. <\/p><p>  This brings us to the context of this meeting, the climate action and low carbon development Bill.  The question is whether we can view the Bill in its current format as being a meaningful contribution to addressing some of that historical injustice and whether it will provide reassurance to people such as my colleagues here today that countries such as Ireland, which is steeped in a history of global solidarity and the promotion of international development, are playing their part in tackling runaway climate change.  Christian Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and Oxfam, which are partners of the organisations represented here today, share the view that the climate Bill in its current form does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the situation that we as a global community, but particularly those in developing countries, are faced with.  In particular, we feel that the absence of any targets from the heads of Bill betrays a lack of urgency and ambition on the part of the Government towards the climate crisis and undermines our international claims to be a leading voice in addressing the hunger, nutrition and climate change nexus.  The fact that we will be adhering to EU targets is a missed opportunity on the part of the Government for Ireland to plot its own ambitious path towards a low-carbon future and to provide certainty about Government policy and a clear pathway for emissions reductions, as the programme for Government puts it.  The Bill as it stands gives no such certainty for the future and for those businesses and individuals wishing to invest in the green economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013041700003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sorley McCaughey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366192200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCaughey for his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013041700004#C00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366192200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I am from Tanzania and I work with an organisation called Pastoral Women's Council.  I am very pleased to be here.  I studied in Ireland some time ago and I feel as though I have a special connection with Ireland.  I have returned to Kimmage Manor.<\/p><p>  I will talk specifically about the impact of climate change on pastoralism.  Pastoralism is a livelihood system which is entirely dependent on land-based resources.  There are three main pillars which maintain and sustain pastoralism.  The first pillar is the availability of pasture, which is crucial.  Mobility is another pillar in the maintenance of pastoralism, because it is necessary to move from one place in order to sustain pastoralism.  Water is also essential in order to sustain our livelihoods.  In the dry land of east Africa we have been experiencing extreme weather conditions.  This has led to frequent droughts, which in turn leads to massive loss of livestock.  For example, I am from the Ngorongoro area of east Africa.  In my district, more than 200,000 livestock were lost in 2009 and 2010.  This has led to extreme poverty and great numbers of people have fled their homes because of poverty.  This is a result of climate change.  For example, Ngorongoro division is also a very popular conservation area because it is a tourism destination.  There are between 70,000 and 136,000 pastoralists living there.  This means it is difficult to sustain the pastoralist life.  The children and women have suffered and died from starvation in great numbers.  The young people have migrated all over Tanzania and even to Kenya because of famine and starvation.  The only employment they can get is as security guards, because most of them are not educated.  This is a significant consequence of the impact of climate change on our livelihoods.  This also has to do with the appropriation of pastoralist land for conservation and farming purposes, which has reduced the grazing pattern.  Water has been very scarce in east Africa because of climate change.  The weather conditions are not predictable and they have changed over time.  The people do not know when to farm or when to plant, nor where to graze the livestock.  There has been frequent movement of pastoralists to other areas and an increase in conflict over resources between farmers and pastoralists.  Climate change is a man-made reality.<\/p><p>  I wish to describe a brief case study from my own village.  When I was growing up in the Loliondo area, all sorts of traditional fruits were available to us to eat while herding our livestock.  There were beehives and plenty of water sources in the area.  Now the situation has changed completely.  The bees are no longer there, while some species of tree have mostly disappeared and those remaining no longer bear fruit.  The seasons are no longer understandable or predictable, even for the plants.  The main diet of the pastoralists has changed and has been reduced to a little milk and very stiff porridge.  The pastoralists' diet used to be mainly milk and meat but now it is cornflour and tea.  When a family has no money it is difficult to feed the children.  Milk is scarce because the cattle are spending long periods searching for water and pasture.  When the rain comes and some milk is available, my family and our neighbours must sell some of the milk to raise money to supply the basic needs of the family.  The source of our staple food is the shops and grain.  When one has no money, one has no food.  Many families are going through a similar situation all over the Ngorongoro district and the situation is worsening.  When members of a family are poorly fed they tend to spend more time sitting and waiting for medical attention because there is a high incidence of disease along with much physical suffering.  Many families are being separated, and women are virtual widows.  There is a high level of migration from rural areas to the towns, with young people in particular going to look for employment.  Disease, fatigue and poor diet are common problems.  During the drought period the village women have to walk nine hours to fetch water and sometimes the water is not available when they reach the water source.  The men have migrated completely in an effort to find work in order to support their families.  The situation is completely unbearable and this is all the result of climate change.  There is much malnutrition, disease and uncertainty in the pastoralist community as a result of climate change.<\/p><p>  Traditionally the Masai have their own ways of coping with drought.  One of the best ways is through mobility.  Nowadays, mobility is not possible because the grazing land has been reduced.  Cows and goats are concentrated in a small area and this also causes significant problems of land degradation.  Another Masai coping strategy is the sharing of resources.  This has sustained the livelihoods of pastoralists.  Any little amount of food is shared with the rest of the family.  This has become a problem because climate change is significantly reducing the number of livestock.  These are a few examples of how the food sources of pastoralists are affected.<\/p><p>  Developing countries have been affected by something we have not caused.  Ireland should take responsibility for a reduction in climate change by setting an example.  This can be done by deciding on specific targets to reduce emissions of carbon gases into the atmosphere.  The Irish Government should ensure such targets are legally binding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013041700004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maanda Ngoitiko","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366192800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Would our other guests like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013041700005#D00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366192800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I am the co-ordinator of the PanAfrican Climate Justice Alliance, a coalition of more than 300 African organisations, including farmers', pastoralists' and women's organisations as well as organisations from diverse backgrounds, which have been brought together to add our voice to advocacy and policy-making on climate change at international level and to try to influence and contribute to the integration of climate change into national poverty reduction and sustainable development in African countries.<\/p><p>  As my colleague said, climate change is really a big issue in Africa.  When I was invited to speak to this committee, I reflected on a number of personalities who have changed this world.  One of them really struck my imagination, namely, Robert Baden-Powell, a Briton and the founding father of the scouting movement.  He died and was buried in Kenya, from where I come.  When he realised he was dying, he told his followers that if they tried to leave this world a little better than it was when they found it, when their time came, they would die with a feeling that they had achieved their best.  As I reflected on that today, I watched the television.  Today is a big day in Ireland and the UK as the former British Prime Minister is being buried.  Opinion is divided on the legacy she has left.  Some people, who are demonstrating, have said her legacy is not positive while others have said she has left a positive one.  It depends on where one stands.  I asked myself what legacy we will leave in the context of climate change, which has both divided the world and brought it together.<\/p><p>  We have come from Africa, where climate change is a real issue.  We do not need scientists to tell us things are changing in Africa.  I refer to a recent report by the UN.  In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of people are farmers, crop yields are expected to fall by 20% due to climate change.  Some 60% to 65% of arable land is already affected by degradation and drought and it is expected to decline further, resulting in serious food shortages, intensifying hunger and malnutrition.  That was highlighted in the meeting hosted by the Mary Robinson Foundation.  <\/p><p>  We are seeing climate change in Africa, as my colleague mentioned.  The habitats of 40% of species may be destroyed altogether.  That means animals such as elephants and porcupines face extinction.  Rainfall is predicted to decline by 10% by 2050 and by 2025, 480 million people in Africa could be living in water-stressed areas.  An estimated 30% of Africa's coastal infrastructure will be lost to rising seas by 2080.  These are realities which we are seeing as we speak.  <\/p><p>  All of us, north and south, are seeing the intensity of climate change.  What is different, as we are hit by climate change calamities, is that people in Ireland, the United States and other industrialised countries have the capacity to absorb the impacts, but what about Africa?  A couple of months ago, we saw the swift response to Hurricane Sandy, although many people suffered and we really sympathise with them.  One can imagine what would happen if such a big event happened in Africa.  There would be no capacity to respond to it and only the international community would respond.  It would be really different from what happened in the United States.  <\/p><p>  Climate change is affecting us, but in different ways.  It is like the <i>Titanic<\/i> in 1912.  Those who were weak and were on the lower decks drowned almost immediately.  We know of only one woman in this group who survived.  However, most of those who were strong and were on the upper decks eventually drowned.  This is the same problem.  When addressing climate change, we must remember it will affect all of us eventually, so we need to look at in that way.  Africa is the lower deck, but none of us will be spared.  That is what brings us to the action we are taking.  <\/p><p>  There is much inertia at global level.  The global community, particularly industrialised countries, have taken comfort from what science says.  We would like to see more ambitious action being taken.  We have led civil campaigns in the United States.  The sense we are getting from our colleagues in Christian Aid and elsewhere is that the political and business classes have more influence on the laws to address climate change, and they do not want their businesses to be destabilised.  However, we will eventually sink like the <i>Titanic<\/i>.

In respect of the climate change Bill, Ms Maanda Ngoitiko mentioned the importance of including firm targets which should be legally enforceable.  It is obvious that the delegation considers that important.  I too appreciate the importance of firm targets and, in fact, introduced a climate change Bill which provides for targets.  Within the European Union, Ireland must reach a certain target by 2050.

They have had a very active few days to debate the issue of climate change and its impact.  I welcome the fact that they are coming here to provide an international perspective on how they are affected.  As an Irish parliamentarian, I would like to give my perspective to them.<\/p><p>  This is a significant food producing country which has many natural resources that it does not fully exploit currently.  That brings its own challenges in terms of reducing our carbon footprint and reaching targets set by the EU or through our own climate change legislation, the debate on which continues.  We are a responsible State which is interested in assisting other countries, which our track record of assistance to countries that have been in trouble in the past proves.  The delegation mentioned first-hand accounts of drought while other countries have experienced flooding.  I saw on the news some contributors to the conference explain how the ice caps are melting.  All of these points must be listened to carefully.  The problem I have - and I will be straight with the delegation, which must hear an Irish perspective - is agriculture.  We must produce food.  We contribute enormously to food security and must find sustainable ways to produce food which do not produce an excessive carbon footprint.  Progress has been made in Ireland with the reduction in emissions per litre of milk by 13% in the last 20 years.  We have a very sustainable, grass-based agriculture system which results in high methane production, which contributes a great deal to our carbon footprint.  We have a dilemma as to whether we set targets to cut the amount of methane produced by reducing the national herd.  Cutting the number of cows and beef cattle will automatically have a detrimental effect not only on the economy of which the agriculture sector is a main driver and contributor to recovery from recession, but also on food production and food security.<\/p><p>  I am being very honest in pointing out that this is the dilemma for Irish politicians.  We must try to bring stakeholders with us to ensure that they adapt, innovate and formulate new agricultural practices which allow them to continue to produce food at a sustainable rate while also reducing carbon emissions.  I suspect that is the reason national targets are not being set.  We must bring stakeholders with us.  Many environmentalists and NGOs say in the context of renewable energy that we must reduce carbon emissions by improving renewable energy technologies, but when major renewable projects are proposed - as with the large-scale wind energy projects in the midlands - some of the same environmentalists oppose them.  While we want to increase renewable energy sources to reduce our carbon footprint, we have a conflict also.  I have a problem with that.  As a nation, we must decide whether we are going to reduce our carbon emissions.  If so, we must be serious about how we achieve that.<\/p><p>  In other areas, we are making progress.  In low carbon electricity generation, a generation station in Great Island, which was dependent on oil and which was producing 240 MW of power, is being converted to a 460 MW generating station based on gas, which is far more sustainable and will decarbonise electricity generation in the State.  I want to assist and to reduce our carbon footprint.  We are a very small country and must protect those sectors that are driving our economy and contributing to food security.  I do not say this out of personal business interest as I am not a farmer.  We must move forward sustainably while bringing stakeholders with us.  By simply setting targets, we could put all of that in jeopardy and find ourselves in a far worse position than the one we are in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013041700009#H00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1366194600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Deputy Stanley always strikes the right balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013041700009#H00300","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speech","time":1366194600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The delegation is very welcome.

The heads of the climate action and low carbon development Bill are being brought through the committee and we will report to the Minister after taking evidence from various sectors.  I am the first to accept that there are flaws in the Bill, which this process will be helpful to consider and tease out.  There are also very positive elements in the proposed legislation which have not been touched on.  Even as it stands, the proposals will put us in the top three member states in terms of the provisions being made.  They cover the targets we have accepted for 2020 and will automatically embed any future international agreements to which we sign up.  They also ensure that there will be an annual report to the D&aacute;il on progress being made by the Government to achieve international targets on climate change.  The other key element is the independent committee which will provide independent commentary on whether Ireland is achieving its targets.<\/p><p>  I do not mean to put anyone on the spot but I am anxious to hear specifics.  When people talk about targets, to which elements of those targets are they referring?  The previous Administration attempted to bring a Bill through and got caught up in a legal quagmire.

The discussion the world over - this is the topic of our discussions - is on how to move on from emissions reduction.  There is a particular debate on low-carbon development pathways and how to do this is a dilemma.  It is indisputable that the current model of development is unsustainable.  Our proposal is that there are ways to do this.  We need to start avoiding profligate lifestyles and to pursue agriculture in such a way that we reduce emissions.  The citizens of a country need to discuss how to do this.  The Bill provides a very good opportunity for discussion, but in its current form, it is weak.

The challenge is how to create a balance without compromising economic growth, while reducing emissions and creating a situation where people would not suffer as a result of what we were doing.<\/p><p>  One question was: should Ireland set a five year target in the Bill?  This is important and maybe the targets can be adopted by each Government when it takes office.  The targets could be set for five or ten years.  Ireland has shown that in the past ten years it has reduced emissions by over 13%.

First, I appreciate that Ireland has made some moves to bring about production systems that will reduce carbon emissions.  If I am not wrong, there was some resistance from NGOs.  It is not possible, however, to reduce carbon emissions without taking some risks.  Carbon emissions reduction is all about risks and opportunities.  It is good that legislators are taking up the challenge of sensitising stakeholders, particularly the farming community, in order that whatever systems they come up with or recommend in their discussions will be environmentally friendly.  If there are some risks, we should have a plan to mitigate them.  One that has come out clearly is that, like us, the Government feels the need to cut down on emissions.  What is lacking is public participation.  In Kenya we drafted a climate change Bill in a particular way, but we made one small mistake - we did not have enough public participation.  The Bill, however, was technically sound.  It was applauded by parliamentarians and passed, but the public participation was lacking.  The point is that the public - the private sector, the farming community, everybody - will live with the Bill.  I would like to see the Irish Government provide an opportunity for further consultation with the farming community and traders.  It will then come up with something that will be very acceptable.  Whatever is included in the Bill will affect those who support it, but they will be ready to comply with the legislation because it originates from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013041700010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Cecilia Kibe Muthoni"},{"type":"speech","time":1366195200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I wholeheartedly welcome our guests.

I am joined here today by my colleagues Mick Stewart and Linda Murphy.  I will commence by giving some background information on the legislation governing charges imposed by banks and other financial institutions.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank acknowledges that increases in bank charges at any time are unwelcome for consumers, and particularly at a time when many households and small businesses are struggling to make ends meet, with decreasing income and increasing costs.  The job of the Central Bank under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 is to ensure that the right balance is struck by credit institutions in recovering the cost of providing services while ensuring the charges they impose on personal and small business account holders are reasonable and appropriate.  I will provide an outline of the key elements of the Act and, importantly, how the Central Bank performs its duties under the Act.<\/p><p>   Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 came into effect in May 1996.  All charges being imposed by credit institutions at that time \"stood notified\".  The Central Bank assumed responsibility for section 149 in 2003.  Under this section, credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank of Ireland if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services, such as making and receiving payments, providing and granting credit and maintaining and administering transaction accounts.  The Act requires the Central Bank, when assessing such submissions, to have regard to the promotion of fair competition, the effect on customers, the statement of commercial justification provided by the institutions and the passing on of costs to its customers.  We either reject the proposal, accept the proposal but at lower levels than requested by the firm, or approve the proposal in full.  While the term charge includes penalty or surcharge interest, the Act specifically excludes rates of interest and any charge, cost or expense levied by a third party and passed on by a credit institution to customers.<\/p><p>  This framework for approval of charges requires the Central Bank to take into account the impact on customers as well as the commercial justification for imposing such charges.  Clearly, all firms aim to recover the cost of providing financial services either directly or indirectly from their customers.  The extent and nature of those charges will reflect the individual strategy of each firm.  Our role is to strike the right balance between the interests of the firms and their customers. <\/p><p>  Each submission received by the Central Bank is subject to rigorous consideration according to the criteria set out in legislation and the contents of that particular submission.  Each submission includes information such as historic and forecasted profit and loss data and projected changes to customer usage.  The extent of the proposed charges or increases is considered and a peer analysis of charges is carried out to help ensure that the promotion of fair competition in the market is taken into account.  When looking at proposed charges, analysis of the impact of the proposition on customers and groups of customers is carried out.  Section 149 extends to both personal and business customers, so the potential impact on groups of customers, such as small businesses, is considered as part of our process.  As part of the assessment process for personal current accounts, the effect on the customer is assessed using, amongst other analyses, our customer profiles.  We have developed four customer profiles, each representing different usage patterns in terms of volumes and types of transaction - for example, electronic versus manual - and differing occurrences of out-of-order charges.  The Central Bank then decides whether to approve, partially approve or reject the proposed charges.  It sets out the maximum level of each charge in a letter of direction.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting that a bank may choose, for commercial or competitive reasons, not to apply charges for which it already has approval or which \"stood approved\" for a period of time, and subsequently apply such charges at a time of its own discretion.  In this regard, these concessions are not subject to a section 149 submission - that is, a bank may choose to apply waivers or discounts of charges or may impose charges at lower than approved levels and subsequently increase these charges.  The Central Bank has no power to approve or reject such revisions.  Any proposed changes to charges or qualifying criteria must be published in advance.<\/p><p>  The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 and the consumer protection code 2012 contain certain requirements relating to the information to be provided on charges to ensure that the customer is aware in advance of the amount of a charge for the provision of certain services.<\/p><p>  Submissions received from a number of banks in the latter half of 2012 and in 2013 reflect the first general increase in current account charges since the Central Bank took responsibility for section 149.  Prior to that, the main providers of current accounts were using the approvals as \"stood notified\" in 1996.  Recent trends have also shown that banks are moving away from the provision of traditional banking channels towards electronic, online and contact-less services.  As part of this, banks have been seeking to create price differentials between manual and automated transactions.  According to the information we have received, there is a significant cost difference to the banks in providing manual and automated transactions and this cost difference has led banks to seek to impose different charges depending on transaction types. <\/p><p>  Regarding mortgage arrears charges, section 149 also covers charges relating to the provision of credit.  As part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s overall response to the growing mortgage arrears problem, in 2010 we carried out a review of charges imposed by mortgage lenders on borrowers in arrears.  At the end of 2010, the Central Bank issued letters of direction to all lenders directing them to refrain from imposing any surcharge interest or any charge arising on a mortgage account in arrears covered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has an almost unique role with regard to bank charges.  We believe we have a robust process in place, including the use of customer profiles, to determine the appropriate levels of increase in charges.  The Central Bank will continue to perform its role under section 149 of the Act in such a way as to ensure an appropriate balance is struck between the need to ensure such charges are reasonable for the consumer and the need for firms to recover their costs for providing such services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700003#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1366204200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

ISME has just under 9,000 members across the country, all of whom are owner-managers of small and medium businesses.<\/p><p>  I am not going to dwell on statistics or comparisons as I am quite sure the Central Bank is more than capable of covering those areas, but will mention the low-lights of the history of the banks in the Irish economy.  Let me start with the collapse of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which probably cost us around &euro;200 million.  Then there was the DIRT debacle, in which the banks made the largest settlement of &euro;90 million.  In July 2004, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, issued a report on the overcharging of 80,000 customers on foreign exchange transactions, which is related to today's discussion on bank charges.  At the time the bank said the cost of refunds would be somewhere in the region of &euro;14 million, but it ended up at &euro;50 million.  In October 2004, a report found that Irish banks were making nearly three times as much profit per customer as their European counterparts and in the process they were ripping off SMEs.  The study found that AIB and Bank of Ireland were each earning in the region of &euro;341 per year per customer, as against &euro;123 per year per customer across Europe.  A study published by the Competition Authority in September 2005 found that SMEs were suffering disproportionately in comparison to big business.  That has always been the case in the context of lending rates and charges in Ireland.  In 2008 there was a major problem, with the banks giving blatant untruths with regard to recapitalisation and the blanket guarantee.  In 2010, we had more untruths, mentioned by the chairman of NAMA when it was taking over what were supposedly performing loans, which proved to be completely overestimated by the banks.  <\/p><p>  I will not dwell on these, but I want to mention the charge by the UK Competition Commission, back in 2001, of cartel-like practices by certain Irish banks and their subsidiaries.  The commission concluded that a complex monopoly situation existed and identified Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland as participants in the restriction and distortion of price competition for small and medium businesses.  That study identified that small and medium businesses were suffering disproportionately in comparison to big business.  That is no major surprise to us.  It was further confirmed in 2003 by the chief executive officer of a bank in Ireland who went on record stating that a cartel was in operation in Ireland and that Irish banks were overcharging their customers.<\/p><p>  My role today is to warn members about the banks - as if they need warning, when the Minister for Finance has said that one cannot believe what bankers say.  I will warn members about the actions of banks and inform them of the dire straits in which the owners of small and medium businesses find themselves due to the economic downturn, brought about partly by the same banks.  I will plead on behalf of members that small and medium businesses be guaranteed fair play in bank charges as we struggle to get the economy back on its feet.  In the current climate, do members think that increases in bank charges of up to 250% can be justified?  The banking market is highly concentrated.  Back in 2003 it was mentioned that it was one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world, and since then we have lost a number of banks.  The two main banks account for 80% of SME lending, and when Ulster Bank is added, those three banks account for 96% of total lending to the SME market.  Basic economics indicate that where there is more competition in banking, margins and profits tend to be lower, so obviously the opposite happens in Ireland, as we know.  Where the market is highly concentrated it is also recognised that banks will find it is not in their interest to compete vigorously.<\/p><p>  Banks make their money in two ways: through interest margins and service charges.  To counteract the effect on margins of the general drop in interest rates, albeit not for small businesses, banks have introduced a range of charges for other services that were previously cross-subsidised by lending margins.  The rescued banks are scurrying around at the moment looking to see where they can increase income.  Anyone going into a bank to renegotiate loans or have an overdraft reviewed is likely to have the interest rate increased, be subject to higher charges on his or her account, or probably both.  Loan arrangement fees are also going to be reintroduced.  With the recent branch closures in AIB and National Irish Bank, we have reached a point at which there are cost penalties when one puts a foot inside the door of the bank.  One of ISME members said in passing that in his local branch of AIB in Carrick-on-Shannon they have replaced a cashier with a bunch of flowers and a third clerk with a machine that takes cash and cheques but not coins, with the result that the waiting time is now an hour.  They have one clerk behind the counter, one or two clerks on the floor circulating and chatting to customers in the queue, and another clerk sitting behind what is loosely called a customer service desk.  He would love to have a queue in his business but he would not have them waiting an hour for service.  When he raised the matter with the staff, their response is that this is new bank policy.  That is what we can come to expect from the banks.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Sheridan has mentioned, bank charges in Ireland are regulated in accordance with the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The current raft of bank charges are now astronomical.  We had to listen to a spokesperson from the Irish Banking Federation recently saying that the banks are returning to more realistic pricing.  It is a pity they were not more realistic when they were lending in the past 15 years.  Such pricing reflects the underlying costs and risks of the products and services they provide, according to the IBF, and meets the requirement to return to profitability.  He then continued, quite smarmily, to tell us that a consideration-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding"},{"type":"speech","time":1366204200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I must ask Mr. Fielding to be more measured in his deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700004#D00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366204200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the word \"smarmily\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding"},{"type":"speech","time":1366204200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will hold the point but I remind the witness of the requirements of the discourse during the hearing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700004#D00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366204200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The official made the point that because the institutions had been recapitalised by the Government they had to be brought back into profit.

At a time when businesses are doing their best to embrace e-business, we believe the banks are not helping the situation.  Increases in business online charges range from 42% to 250%, whereas those for paper transactions have risen by 33% to 97%.  The increases for business online transactions are much higher.  AIB is increasing its cash handling fees by a whopping 165%.  It has dropped the secondary and primary rates of 17 cent per &euro;100 and has adopted a standard rate of 45 cent per &euro;100.  It is not the first time we have experienced such increases by the banks.  The last time we had increases of this level was when the euro was being introduced in 1999 and fixed rates were being set across the euro currency zone.  As consumers we expected major benefits, but those did not materialise.  Instead, the bank ratcheted up commission from an average of &pound;3.50 to as high as &pound;45.  It is a matter of regret that the banks managed to pull the wool over the eyes of the director of the Office of Consumer Affairs at the time, who passed these increases.  It was due to the strong intervention by ISME to highlight the massive disparity in commissions to which the Office of Consumer Affairs had agreed that the banks then reduced their charges somewhat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700004#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366204800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I am keen for members of the committee to engage with Mr. Fielding at some stage this afternoon.

As I said, we are looking at increases of between 23% and 250%.  I urge the committee to call on the Financial Regulator to rescind its decision to allow new bank charges to be introduced.

From the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises, some 77% of banking in the State is carried out in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In earlier correspondence Mr. Fielding spoke about a duopoly and made the point that the market here was very restrained.  What level of oversight does the Central Bank have in this regard?

The committee does not need me to tell it that the market is very concentrated.  Obviously, we are aware of this when we assess whether to approve bank charges.  We are conscious that the banking market is not properly competitive.  If it was, I am not sure section 149 would be needed.  One of the benefits of that section is that it provides for an element of control over the extent of the charges that can be introduced by the bigger players.  In the past couple of years the Competition Authority considered the section 149 issue as part of its examination of the level of competition in the market.  My understanding is that it concluded there was no rationale for the removal of the section.  The facts mentioned by the Chairman explain why it should remain in place.  We would all like competitors to come in, compete and make the market more competitive.  I think there are plans to try to encourage this.  I am not sure that the rules governing bank charges prevent competitors from coming in.  However, I understand it has been proposed that new entrants would not be subject to the section 149 provisions for a period of time.

In 2011, we published some research we conducted and we also published four different profiles of typical usage of current accounts.

In the circumstances where it costs up to &euro;300, the profile we used includes circumstances where the customer incurs quite a number of out of order charges and surcharge interest on unapproved overdrafts and the like.  We have noticed these types of charges push up the annual cost and that when we approve these charges, they have a big impact on people who are struggling.  Therefore, we have tried to keep those charges at a reasonable level.

I have a letter which was received by a constituent from AIB.  It details the increases from a rate of 17 cent secondary rate and 25 cent primary rate, to 45 cent per &euro;100, with effect from 1 July 2013.  Mr. Fielding said that these letters stated that the customer had a right to choose whether to close the account.<\/p><p>  I ask if we should make comparisons with the charges further afield than in the UK to see how they stack up.  I note Mr. Fielding's comments that the asking price from some of the British banks may be higher but in practice they charge a much lower rate.  This is a concern.  Small businesses handle a lot of cash and the charges are an issue.  The person who received this letter from AIB is one of those people.  He is concerned about the implications for his business.  There will be a certain increase in costs for those businesses.  It seems like the banks are coming after them one more time.  The banks were bailed out after the failure of the regulators and the Central Bank but they are coming back after the small businesses with this charge.  The banks loan out the money they take in as deposits.  They are making money out of lending.<\/p><p>  The talk in recent months is about getting more capital for the banks.  Surely this is a disincentive for people who will then avoid the banks.  I am one of those people who try to stay away from the banks as much as possible.

I appreciate that it will have a big impact on some firms - we have received submissions on this - but we have to take into account the criteria set out under the Act rather than purely looking at it from one side or the other.<\/p><p>  In terms of what is driving this, it was mentioned earlier that the banks' ability to recover and become profitable again is limited in terms of where they can go to do that.  The net interest margin is one matter that falls outside section 149.  Bank charges and fees is another area.  The rationale for seeking these increases is being put forward.  That is what they are trying to do - to recover the costs so they can become profitable.  The good thing about section 149 is that it is only one element of a framework that we have to take into account.

It was mentioned earlier that when people walk into banks they are faced with automated machines.  I am aware of a situation in which somebody walked into the bank and used one of these machines but did not get a receipt for the money lodged, and nor could they get the money back out of the machine.  They went in to make a lodgement but it took about half an hour to get a member of staff to deal with it, and another to get the money out of the machine.  The person runs a small business around the corner from the bank and is what is referred to as a sole trader, which meant the business was closed for an hour and a half while the bank staff fiddled around with the machine.  I highlight that, because we must cater for cash customers.<\/p><p>  The advent of plastic cards was a means of enslavement.  They are handy, but they are a means of enslavement.  One effect of their introduction is that the value of money has been lost.  When I started working, and for a long time after that, I was paid in cash.  I am not advocating that we go back to paying people in cash but one had X amount of money in one's pocket.  One knew how much one needed for the rest of the week and how much to put away for car insurance, a house loan or whatever.  We all know the problem with plastic cards.  People were borrowing on one against another, and it has turned out to be a means of enslavement.  There are customers, particularly elderly people, who want to continue using cash.  I believe strongly that their right to trade and have a service through cash should be upheld.<\/p><p>  One of my concerns is that elderly people have told me they are reluctant to go into the bank because if they cannot operate the machines, they will leave.  We have seen instances in which money is kept in biscuit tins and under mattresses, and horrific circumstances in which elderly people have been robbed, tied up and assaulted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700010#K00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1366207800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The Deputy is over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700010#K00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1366207800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>That was a very quick 12 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700010#K00700","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1366207800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>It was 12 minutes.

Obviously, they are able to attract interest on these by putting them on the inter-bank market nightly.  They make profits on the back of them.  There is no mechanism that I am aware of in any of the banks dictating that one cannot go below the threshold.  Without our knowledge, many of us go below the threshold and are charged the full fees and surcharges thereafter.  That is not an appropriate way to conduct business, especially when there are ATMs, etc.  If the banks want people to have a certain amount of money in their accounts, they should protect the money in the accounts and make the process of withdrawal to a point below the threshold more difficult than simply going to an ATM.

We seem to be hearing that the wider economy, particularly SMEs and ordinary citizens, is being screwed yet again by the same banks that screwed the public finances because of their requirement for a bailout.  They are screwing mortgage holders with threats of repossession and are refusing to give them write-downs on unsustainable loans.  They are screwing the SME sector by not lending to it and are also screwing that sector and citizens by imposing more charges, essentially to recover their losses.  Mr. Sheridan seems to be saying there is nothing the Central Bank can do about it because the banks pretty much have a free hand to do what they are doing because of legislation passed in 1996.

It is like studying the etymology of Mr. Sheridan's position.  The banks are still bust and his colleague, Ms Fiona Muldoon, has stated that 50% of SMEs' &euro;50 billion worth of exposure to the banks is distressed, impaired or non-performing based on the original terms of the credit financing.<\/p><p>  The word \"consumer\" is unfortunate because the customers of the banks are either lenders or borrowers.  They are not consumers in the sense of going into a supermarket or department store.  As the bankers say, it is about relationships and trust.  A mortgage is based on a 25 year period of trust with streams of money being advanced up front by the lender and coming back with interest attached.  The income on the streams of money coming back to the banks is sticky.  It is not renegotiable unless the fundamental terms of the relationship have altered and the bank has an opportunity to change the rate.  We now know that parts of the banks' balance sheets, if considered as a big sector of industry, are income sticky and the other bits, such as the plastic cards and current accounts, offer opportunities to go into fourth, fifth or supercharge gear for income.  That is the territory in which we are currently moving.<\/p><p>  The trouble is that 150,000 bank customers in the sticky income part are in deep distress.  Some of them are so depressed or fearful that they are taking their own lives.  That position arose only because the banking sector accepted a wall of credit from other institutions in addition to the credit they got from the normal depositors in the system.  This wave of extra money came, greedily, from abroad to bolster their balance sheets and the banks' management and boards topped it up further with short-term money from money markets to lend long.  To do this over six years, with average loan to deposit ratios of 150%, is utterly dangerous from a financial engineering point of view.  With that credit expansion, asset prices rose terribly and normal people, households and businesses had no option in this turbocharged credit expansion and asset bubble but to borrow on the terms offered by the banking sector and allowed by the Irish regulator and the international euro system regulator.  The international counter-party appraisers, that is, the funds which invested in the banks also allowed this to happen.  <\/p><p>  When the bubble burst after six years, prices collapsed but loans did not.  The establishment and the law are on the side of the lenders.  We are now worrying about the epidermal or skin level of consumers' lives, that is, the charges they pay on bringing money to and from the banks and credit cards, which have increased by 23%, but the internal organs of the people and their businesses are deeply damaged by negative equity of up to &euro;250,000 in some cases where loans totalled anywhere between &euro;750,000 and &euro;800,000.  The banks funded those debts at not less than 75% even for those which were being relatively prudential.  If they offered a loan of 100%, they funded the entire asset bubble price.  If they funded the entire asset bubble price, why should they not be funding 100% of the negative equity outcome?  That would give the consumers about whom we are now worrying the confidence and the justified and unassailable right not to be pushed around, talked down to or made to feel deferential with the discussions that are beginning to take place with the banks for the purpose of restructuring or writing off the impossible elements of the loans with which they are burdened.  That is important for every borrower in that situation to understand.  They need not be ashamed.  The banks should be ashamed about negative equity after six years of a turbocharged credit and asset bubble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700013#N00900","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1366209600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Deputy Mathews has ten minutes and has used up seven of them.

These meetings can often be bruising encounters.  I had to leave the meeting earlier to speak in the D&aacute;il but I have read Mr. Fielding's presentation.<\/p><p>  In Mr. Sheridan's view, is the right legislation, tools and capacity in place?  The McKinsey study carried out in the 1990s looked at European banking.  It concluded that Irish banks were the most profitable, if not in the world, in Europe.  In his remarks, Mr. Fielding cited a report from October 2004 by the Wall Street financiers which indicated that Irish banks were making three times the profit of other European banks.  A European Commission report from 1997 concluded that there was cartel activity operating in the Irish banks.  We obviously have a long and regrettable history of Irish banking activity in this country over the past few decades.  Various reports from multiple sources, all of which are credible, suggest that Irish banks make more money from Irish citizens and businesses than do other banks in comparable countries and that this has been the case for a long time, including in the mid-1990s.  According to the European Commission it was going on in the late 1990s and according to the Wall Street financiers it was going on in the 2000s.  <\/p><p>  I appreciate that Mr. Fielding's job is, as set out in his opening remarks, to find the right balance.  Another phrase used by him in his opening remarks is that \"charges should be reasonable and appropriate\".  If one compares what Irish consumers, citizens and businesses are being charged relative to consumers, citizens and businesses in other countries, charges are not reasonable and appropriate.  One of two things would appear to be wrong.  Either the legislation is insufficient and the delegations, their teams, the Regulator and Governor do not have sufficient authority from the Oireachtas to achieve real competitiveness as benchmarked against other countries or they do have that authority but are not using it properly.  Something is wrong if Irish citizens, consumers and businesses have been consistently over at least two decades charged several times more than the European average.  Perhaps the delegates would give their view on whether they believe they have the legislative tools and capacity necessary and, if they do, why this consistent trend continued over several decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700014#O00400","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366210200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Only one other country in the world of which we are aware has a similar framework to Ireland's in terms of controlling bank charges.

A European Commission study in 2009 looked specifically at bank charges rather than bank profitability.  Ireland ranked mid-table in that study.  I accept that relates back to 2009 and should perhaps be revisited.  However, that is a fair point in terms of how we determine whether it is reasonable.  In 2011, we looked at the charges imposed in Northern Ireland and England.  We found that while it is a different model, out of order charges here are significantly lower than in the UK and, in terms of transaction charges, we are broadly in line although a number of banks in the UK still offer transaction fee free banking.  However, behind that are additional charges should an account go out of line.  On that basis, we believe it is reasonable enough.

A substantial number of other investors were not so lucky and are statute barred from pursing the bank.

I think the Deputy is implying that in the insurance sector scenarios he outlined, there are more long-term products.  Therefore, a consumer may be less likely to become aware of an issue during the six-year period and run out of time.  Slightly different provisions apply, for example, when approaching the Pensions Ombudsman for pension-type products.  The provision relates to the period when one becomes aware of an issue and does not purely rely on when a consumer bought a product.

It is a significant amount of money for someone in receipt of social welfare.

The market is not working at the moment.  People are stuck in negative equity.  They cannot move because they have tracker mortgages.  All sorts of new reasons are preventing people from moving.  Distressed borrowers and distressed businesses are stuck with banks they cannot get away from.  In a healthy banking market, they would be able to move and take their business elsewhere.  The same banks are able to increase charges unilaterally.  We all know that is putting businesses out of operation and causing huge distress.

I am not convinced that we have provided those tools.<\/p><p>  I wish to reflect briefly on an aspect of this matter before asking a question about the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  We must establish whether the charging structure or environment is reasonable and appropriate.  Obviously, there is no right answer.  It is a judgment call.  It would be incredibly useful to know where we stand by comparison with the rest of the OECD countries.  If we are in the bottom quarter in terms of charges to businesses and citizens, that is great, reasonable and appropriate.  If we are in the top 10% or 15% along with the UK, that is neither reasonable nor appropriate.  I wonder if it might be possible to get some kind of comparative analysis.  I would be astounded if it has not already been done.  Perhaps an official from the Central Bank can send something on to us.  I would be much more comforted by the Central Bank's judgment call if I could see that we are in the mid-range of OECD countries in this regard.  Is that possible?

I have made a submission because I am deeply concerned about what the proposed changes will do to citizens in this country.  I guess that is for another day.  The Central Bank acted correctly and admirably in 2010 when it instructed the banks not to impose surcharges on mortgages in arrears if the borrowers in question came under the protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That was welcome.  It was a great move.  The proposed revisions open up numerous new avenues for banks to get borrowers away from the protections of the code of conduct.  When a borrower is designated as non-co-operating, he or she will no longer enjoy the protection of the code of conduct.  The proposed changes open up numerous ways for the bank to make such a designation - ways which were not available to the banks in the past.  Is the Central Bank concerned that its admirable 2010 instruction to banks not to keep ratcheting up the charges on distressed borrowers in arrears will no longer apply and such practices will happen again?  The revised proposals make it much easier for banks to get borrowers out of the process and away from the protections of the code of conduct.  Therefore, they will enable the banks to start stacking up the charges again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013041700018#S01700","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366212600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>All submissions will be fully considered as part of the current consultation process.  There is no doubt that we are trying to make the categorisation of co-operating and non-co-operating lenders and borrowers clearer.

They need to be notified in advance that they are to be deemed as non-co-operating, advised of what they need to do to be designated as co-operating and made aware of the implications of all eventualities.  The Deputy is right when he suggests that the potential exists for non-co-operating borrowers who have not made a strategic decision not to co-operate to be affected by this.

The revised proposals allow the bank to determine whether one is co-operating.  If one wants to appeal, one has to appeal to the bank.  As far as I am aware, consumers or citizens cannot appeal to the Central Bank.  The banks have not necessarily acted in the interests of the country in the last while.  Some of them, at least, may continue to act in that way.  If a bank decides that one has not replied to it within a timeframe it deems appropriate, it can decide that one is not co-operating.  If one wants to appeal that, one will have to appeal it to the bank.  We can guess what the answer will be in those circumstances.  If the bank decides one is not responding to its timescales in a way it deems appropriate - with no oversight from the Central Bank and no independent appeal - it will be able to classify one as non-co-operating.  The bank will be able to remove the statutory provisions given to one by the Oireachtas and the Central Bank.  It will then be able to start hitting one with lots of charges on one's arrears.  I suggest that it will be much easier for the banks to act in this manner under the new proposals.

I am delighted to welcome her.  I met her briefly earlier.  She is accompanied by Mr. Colm O'Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, and Ms Aisling Seely of Amnesty International Ireland.<\/p><p>  In our work programme for the year the joint committee selected a number of priority areas, particularly the area of promotion of human rights and equality in terms of gender, sexual orientation, religion and ethnicity.  There has been increased awareness and significant progress in many countries, including Ireland, in human rights issues and in respect of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.  However, progress has been slower in many other countries.  In Uganda a growing culture of homophobia and intolerance has had negative consequences for the gay rights community there.  The anti-homosexuality Bill which is awaiting consideration in the Ugandan Parliament provides, among other things, for the death penalty in cases of aggravated homosexuality.  It is against this background that Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabasgesera will address the committee.  She is executive director of Freedom and Roam Uganda, an NGO which seeks to empower gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and jointly advocate for respect, protection and fundamental rights in Uganda.  <\/p><p>  Before commencing, I advise that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.

They called on all people in the community and around the village not to accept anything to do with homosexuality.   They attacked the mother of the late David Kato, who is a very old woman and is sick in hospital.  We continue to face challenges in the health sector.  We are not included in the national HIV-AIDS policies.

We have been advising our donor countries and partners there should be clear guidelines on policies between donor countries and Uganda so that if there is discrimination against certain groups and they are not getting the services they should be getting, some of the aid will be channelled to civil societies dealing directly with these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera"},{"type":"speech","time":1366207200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

We also have workers in Uganda who are LGBT.  This meeting went well.  We have also been advising politicians, members of parliament, the international community and governments that during the universal periodic review, Uganda accepted three recommendations to protect LGBT persons and to investigate violence and abuse of LGBT persons.  However, this has not been implemented since March last year.  Therefore, we are working through our diplomatic missions to lobby and try to see how aid can be tied to the policies that were accepted by Uganda.

None of us in this country who have been involved in easier aspects of this trouble have had to confront anything like the brutality, the viciousness and violence that happens in Uganda.  I was also honoured to meet David Kato at a meeting of Front Line Defenders in Dublin Castle and I had no idea that within a matter of months he would be so savagely murdered.  It is very important that Ms Nabagesera is here and that people here who may have different views on this issue should hear what it is like because it is so clearly a fundamental human rights issue.<\/p><p>  The briefing was helpful but only 10% of it was relevant to the gay issue.  The others had some marginal relevance but they displayed a remarkable degree of corruption within the Government of Uganda which is a difficulty that must be examined.  It was very interesting and useful that Ms Nabagesera was able to tell us that, as I suspected, it would be counterproductive to have used sanctions and so on because people would then be punished again.<\/p><p>  I would like to ask about a couple of issues that might be helpful and which our committee might consider.  In the list of aid that we give &euro;500,000 goes to male advocacy.  I assume that is for violence against women but I wonder if we could earmark some for this very specific area.  Would that be useful or would that also expose gay people to antagonism?  Looking at it from outside I think that could be helpful but I might be quite wrong.<\/p><p>  Could Ms Nabagesera signal to us the names of some of the leading members, starting with herself and David Kato's bereaved, elderly and sick mother?  Having been interested for a very long time in human rights I have found when I travel or even at a meeting such as this that if one signals directly to the diplomatic representatives here and asks them to transmit to their capital that as a people, a Government and a committee on foreign affairs we are taking a specific interest in the welfare of these people it may serve to protect them.  If Ms Nabagesera feels that would be useful perhaps she could supply us with an appropriate list.  We cannot protect the whole gay population but it would be helpful if key people could be protected.<\/p><p>  I want to know about the type of pressure we could apply.  I say with great sorrow as a practising and believing Christian that it seems to me that the Christian churches are almost entirely responsible for this appalling mess and it is a disgrace.  That is the European inheritance.  That is what they imported, not homosexuality, which exists throughout the mammalian kingdom.  We have an interesting situation here where the Papal Nuncio is the doyen of the diplomatic corps and it might be possible for us to write a polite letter asking that the hierarchy in Uganda make it very clear that this is not consonant with Christianity at all.  I would be happy to write privately to the Archbishop of Canterbury who I imagine would be surprised to learn of my existence but as an Anglican I think we should lean on him and on the Archbishop of Dublin as well.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to take up too much of Ms Nabagesera's time but I would like to know if any of these measures would be helpful or if any are completely out of order.  Why not try to get something done at the Inter-Parliamentary Union?  It deals with journalists' standards.  There are also the International Press Association and the NUJ.  The newspapers have taken this up because the sensationalist events earn money for them, particularly when churches show pornography.  It might be possible to explore those avenues.  I will be interested to know if any of these suggestions would be counter-productive or if any of them would be good and if so could Ms Nabagesera facilitate us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700004#C00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1366207800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for appearing before us today and I congratulate Ms Nabagesera on her submission.  I agree in general with Senator Norris.  There are several points we need to establish in respect of discrimination and discriminatory legislation.  Discrimination is one thing but discriminatory legislation is another matter because it carries the imprimatur and approval of society.  That is a very dangerous thing, particularly in the so-called enlightened world in which we now live.  It is important that we create a clear impression throughout the international community that discriminatory legislation is unacceptable.  Violation of human rights is unacceptable.  I recognise that we are not encouraged to impose conditions on aid and I understand all the reasons for that, nonetheless we need to make it clear that insofar as aid is concerned we need the societies to which the donation is directed to recognise that we do not propose to support in any way, shape or form, discrimination or the violation of human rights.  To what extent we have to pursue that remains with us.  All the countries to which we donate aid should recognise that we are not here for the taking.  We should not be expected to donate indefinitely if there are blatant violations of human rights and disregard of international norms in human rights.  I strongly support Deputy Norris' points in that regard and I suggest that perhaps as a committee we liaise with our colleagues in relevant similar committees throughout the EU with a view to mobilising opinion throughout the Union to this effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700004#C00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366207800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.

We have told them that if the government does not have clear policies on how this aid should reach the communities our government will continue to discriminate and to leave out a group of people.

Suggestions that aid might be cut - I acknowledge no member here has suggested that - in opposition to this Bill will only increase the vulnerability of that community.  The view is that everything that happens in Uganda at the moment, every single political development, is the fault of the gays; it is that extreme.<\/p><p>  We had a very positive meeting this morning with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish Aid to discuss Ireland's aid programme.  Kasha Nabagesera made it clear at the meeting that neither she nor the LGBTI activists in Uganda were asking for aid to be cut.  As members of general Ugandan society, they are also dependent on some of the services and initiatives provided through that aid programme.  However, they would support a targeting of some aid to support civil society in Uganda. <\/p><p>  Approximately 39 organisations joined forces with Kasha and her colleagues in opposition to the Bill.  Those 39 organisations - many of which are human rights organisations - have now been blacklisted by the government and signalled for closure.  There is a very heavy suppression of any organisation that speaks out in favour of LGBTI rights generally.<\/p><p>  I refer to two issues with regard to the legislation.  Homosexuality is already a criminal offence in Uganda.  It is noteworthy for us in Ireland and particularly for those such as Senator Norris who managed to secure the repeal of that legislation that Uganda operates under the same post-colonial laws as did Ireland until 1993.  It is exactly the same legislation.  What is different about the current legislation is not just the threat of the death penalty but also the focus on suppressing freedom of expression.<\/p><p>  The promotion of homosexuality is forbidden.  Any reference to homosexuality in the public sphere must be negative; it must be an attack.  The rhetoric is increasingly violent.  Anyone who seeks to defend or push back on that rhetoric is accused of promoting homosexuality.  The narrative put out by the evangelical churches who are behind the legislation,  also by the media and supporters of the Bill and many politicians, is that LGBTI activists are actively recruiting children to homosexuality; that this is the focus of their efforts; that they are seeking, for instance, to destroy the traditional African family.  That community is being particularly scapegoated for the most extreme and bizarre things in Uganda - a situation that is somewhat familiar to us in this country.  It is very important that the rhetoric is calm and reasoned.<\/p><p>  This is the reason we suggest that the committee might wish to consider the three recommendations from Uganda's recent UN universal periodic review.  Uganda accepted three recommendations which all refer directly to the need to investigate and prosecute those guilty of violent attacks on members of the LGBTI community.  One of the recommendations also referenced stopping discrimination of LGBTI people in Uganda.  If Ireland worked to support the Ugandan state by means of its diplomatic influence in order to help it to deliver on the accepted recommendations of the UN profiles, this would be a way to begin that dialogue.  I ask Ireland to consider discussions with the Ugandan Government in an effort to create an environment in which an appropriate public debate or discourse on these issues would be more possible.  That is a longer-term piece of work but is one that needs to begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1366208400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Kasha Nabagesera and her advocates.  I know Africa reasonably well, having lived there for four years.  My question to Kasha is, why Uganda?  Is there something going on in Uganda that has caused the targeting of homosexuals?  I agree with Colm O'Gorman and other speakers that our response must take into account the sensitivities of the Prime Minister, the President and the Government of Uganda with regard to western influences on these issues.  I am trying to decide whom we should target.  Colm O'Gorman referred to evangelical churches.  In parts of Africa, homosexuality is deemed to be not the norm.  However, who is stirring the flames in Uganda?  The reaction seems to be disproportionate to anything else we hear from the rest of Africa.  Is it political populism?  Have the evangelical churches something to do with it?  Is it the Muslim community in the northern region?  Capital cities are usually more open-minded than rural areas.  I do not know if there is a difference in emphasis among the citizenry of Kampala as the capital city as against a tribal community or the Muslim community.<\/p><p>  Historically we have reason to be very scared of people who advocate this type of anti-gay philosophy.  It happened in Rwanda when certain priests got hold of the airwaves and there was resultant savagery between Tutsi and Hutu.

It is another law that is used to disguise why one is being arrested.  There have been cases in which people have been arrested because they have been blackmailed.

It is very unsettling and disheartening at times to hear Ms Nabagesera speak of the Ugandan committee's wish that the Bill would just pass on the grounds that the activists would know how to deal with it and have strategies.  At the same time, we hear very clearly that their view is that if the Bill is passed, many people will be killed.  While physical attacks are happening and members of the community are beaten badly, people are told repeatedly to wait until the Bill is passed, at which time the problem will really be solved.  People are waiting for the Bill.  It is not just that the Bill carries the death sentence.  It is that it is seen by very many as a licence to openly kill, with impunity, members of the LGBT community.<\/p><p>  On Senator Norris's suggestion that there might be engagement with officials from the Roman Catholic Church, the majority church in Uganda, I had it pointed out to me recently that the Catholic Church has come out against the Bill in Uganda.  I will give the statement to Senator Norris if he wants to see it.  The statement from the Catholic bishops' conference of Uganda starts with the line, \"We, the Catholic Bishops of Uganda, appreciate and applaud the Government's effort to protect the traditional family and its values.\"  It states homosexuals are in need of repentance, conversion and rehabilitation.  It expresses concern that the Bill does not allow for that to happen.  Specifically, according the church, the criminalisation of people who have knowledge of homosexuals creates a difficulty for priests, teachers, etc., who might assist them in repentance and conversion on that basis.  Thankfully, the statement points out that the death penalty is a significant issue, and it has particular difficulty with it.  However, the statement ends thus: \"Additionally, in our view the proposed Bill is not necessary considering that acts of sodomy are already condemned under section 145 of the penal code.\"  It asserts the legislation is unnecessary because there is already a sentence of life imprisonment in place under Ugandan law.  In the interest of trying to influence key influencers, that statement is possibly a route of potential influence.  I hope church leaders, particularly leaders of the Roman Catholic Church, will be able to influence the kinds of statements being made in Uganda.  The Ugandan bishops' statement is not a rejection of the legislation but a statement of support for its intent and design and a reaffirmation of criminalisation.  The route I suggest could be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1366209600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Would it have been better if the statement had not been made at all?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700007#F00600","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366209600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>The statement was utterly unhelpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700007#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1366209600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I am grateful, as a non-member of the committee, for the opportunity to speak.

Having listened to everything, I am as perplexed and depressed as can be because I still do not know what is driving this - the why, where and what.  Usually, there is an explanation for hate campaigns.  It may be inexplicable but there is an explanation.  It might be rooted in politics or economics.  That does not seem to be the case here.  There are opportunities in Uganda with the discovery of oil, and the economy should bring people up to middle income standards.  It does not seem to have anything to do with politics as the President is popular and keeps getting re-elected.  Yet Ms Nabagesera says it is an uniting force.  I do not understand this urge to unite.  What is driving this fear that people feel they must unite in this way?<\/p><p>  What is really depressing is that Ms Nabagesera comes here as part of a campaign, yet it is being recommended that we tread so softly and raise this issue in such a subtle and oblique way as to make it almost meaningless.  She spoke about the church and I agree that this is a way of doing it.  It certainly behoves the church not only to speak out against the Bill but to speak out against the church in Uganda.

We have seen that in the past.  We told our allies and governments to condemn publicly the Bill in Uganda and to have protests around the world, and then realised that it was causing a backlash for us at home.  It caused more attacks.  Many people lost their jobs because people thought they were being bought by the West and that the West was imposing this issue on them.  People believe we are being bought to be homosexuals and to promote homosexuality.  We realised that the more it is out in the public arena, the greater the backlash.  When governments say they are cutting aid because of corruption, people think it is just a disguise and that they are cutting aid because of homosexuals, and then people start attacking us.  A large brick was thrown through the window of a colleague of mine at the time Uganda refunded aid to Ireland.  A neighbour had lost a child in hospital because there was no medication.  All the anger was directed at my colleague who is a homosexual.  They said there was no medicine because of us and that was why the aid was withdrawn.<\/p><p>  Quiet diplomacy is working well because we are telling our allies to lobby governments quietly in order that people do not attack us.  Every single situation and problem in Uganda is regarded as being caused by homosexuals.  Following the bombings in Uganda at the time of the World Cup final, there was a big headline in the media that \"homo-terrorists\" did it.  It is causing a considerable backlash, which is why we are saying that action should be taken quietly.  Legislators should not feel they are being told what to do in public.  That is what happened with the Speaker of Parliament when she was confronted openly by the Canadian Member of Parliament.  She promised to give Ugandans the Bill as a Christmas present because she wanted to show that she is in control and has the power.  We prefer quiet diplomacy and one-on-one engagements.<\/p><p>  In respect of the issue of suicide, due to this harassment, discrimination and everything going on in the community, people are getting fed up with their lives.  They are telling students to name suspected homosexuals.  The name of one young girl appeared on everyone's list in a school.  They assembled the entire school, called her parents and caned her in front of everyone.  She felt humiliated, went back to the dormitory, got a bottle of pills and killed herself.  It was all over the radio.  Everyone was calling in to say that it was good that they had got rid of a homosexual.  People were jubilant because this thing had happened.  No government official condemned it and the school and parents were never held accountable.  So suicide is present.<\/p><p>  Kenyans came to Uganda because they saw that there was an active and vibrant movement there but when they arrived, the suffering was heaped on them.  A recent case involved an activist from Kenya who died in Uganda.  He decided to come to Uganda because he thought the movement was strong.  He committed suicide.  We had to transport his body because his parents refused to come for him.  They said it was shameful.  There is much that is creating fear in Uganda because it is the powerful who have the audience to promote their agenda to.  They are telling people it is against our culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366210800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>On the question of what members can do, we face the same struggle as an activist and campaigning organisation.  Much of our work involves mobilising people to effect change.  There will be times when it is important to make public statements, but this is not one of them.  This is a time when careful considered diplomacy is required because people need to influence and support a different kind of decision making by political leaders in Uganda.  There are indications that such an approach is beginning to work.  It is a matter for diplomats and parliamentarians to work out how they can engage with their counterparts in those countries, but Ireland has a particular story to tell as a post-colonial State that has gone through a 30 year process of major change followed by limited change and then rapid change over the past ten years.  It may be useful to point out in informal conversations with African parliamentarians that the world did not come to an end for Ireland despite all the predictions about the impact of the changes we underwent in recent years.  The world did not even come to an end last Monday morning.<\/p><p>  There are opportunities for ongoing engagement and dialogue.  For example, the human rights commission in Uganda, which has not been especially helpful, shifted its position significantly after engaging with human rights commissions from other countries and building its own capacity.  Targeted support for LGBT activist organisations in Uganda is also important.  The only way that the voice of this community can emerge is if it has the resources to tell its stories by publishing booklets and organising campaigns that allow it be visible in a positive and healthy way.  This takes tremendous courage on the part of Ms Nabagesera and her colleagues, and we need to think about how to support them.<\/p><p>  We must also understand what is happening in Uganda in the context of a broader human rights crisis.  Sadly, this is not unique to Uganda.  We see moves to enact discriminatory laws across Africa and the same issues have arisen in Russia and parts of the Balkan states.  We must challenge these developments.  Even in the context of the successful negotiation of the arms trade treaty, there was opposition to mentions of gender because it was recognised that it also involved sexual orientation and gender identity.  The association of Islamic states, the Holy See and others opposed advances in protections under human rights law on the basis of gender, particularly in the area of sexual orientation and gender identity.  This is something that we must be watchful for as a State.  I suggest that members may be able to do something as parliamentarians by helping to strengthen international human rights provision in general to ensure sexual orientation and gender identity are recognised as grounds on which discrimination should not be permitted.  These are tangible initiatives we can take to make a dramatic impact in the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1366210800,"counter":508,"content":"<p>It is not often that we have 11 members of the committee, and two non-members, asking questions.

Many of us were hugely impressed by Mr. Browder's presentation.  We decided to go a particular route, namely, that the Chairman would initiate discussions with the Russian embassy and ambassador to ensure the committee was balanced in addressing the issue.  I understand the Chairman subsequently met with the ambassador and that the joint committee has received correspondence from him.  The final paragraph of that correspondence is, to say the least, disappointing.  With respect to the ambassador, it appears to threaten that if we take this human rights issue as seriously as intended, it will have ramifications for Russian-Irish adoptions.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, spoke yesterday in the D&aacute;il about the progress being made in relation to Vietnamese and Russian adoptions.  The ambassador has added an extra dimension to this debate, which dimension I do not like.  The ambassador has effectively stated that our debate of this issue may have ramifications for the near completed Russian-Irish adoption process.  I believe we should take his sentiments seriously.  As stated by previous speakers, we must be diplomatic in how we address that which we have initiated by way of the Magnitsky issue and the threat from the embassy that we may be jeopardising the Russian-Irish adoption process.<\/p><p>  Somewhere in the correspondence on this issue reference is made to the European Union having debated and discussed this issue.  It would be no harm if the joint committee made contact with the relevant European committee which heard from speakers from the Duma on the issue.  I would like to know the outcome of those discussions before we run off on our own seeking to introduce legislation which probably will never happen given the process of enacting legislation in this country.<\/p><p>  I believe we should be diplomatic in our approach on this issue.  It is an important human rights issue which should not be dropped but kept alive.  However, we must balance this against the human rights of Irish citizens on the verge of adopting a child, which is important to them and their lives.

We will be considering some of these again when we meet in Luxembourg next Monday.<\/p><p>  During the past couple of years, the issue which has undoubtedly received the closest and most sustained attention from the Council has been the political transformations in the Middle East and north Africa linked to the Arab spring.<b><\/b>While the crisis in Syria has understandably taken up much of our time, the Council has also addressed other issues in the region.  At our January meeting, for example, we conducted an important stock take in relation to the overall EU strategy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the process of transition which is under way in many Arab societies.<\/p><p>  A little over two years on from the popular uprisings which first took hold in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011, any reasonable assessment must conclude that the process of change we are witnessing has been largely positive in its consequences for the region.  Of course, there have been many challenges and setbacks, with the conflict in Syria clearly presenting a major threat to peace and stability in the region.  However, this should not be allowed to overshadow the very real and positive changes we have seen, such as the holding of democratic elections in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen, effectively for the first time in most cases.<\/p><p>  The EU, for its part, is committed to upholding key values, such as respect for human rights and the rule of law, in the efforts it is making to provide support and partnership to the countries undergoing transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700013#N00200","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366213200,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I must interrupt the T&aacute;naiste.

The April Council will adopt conclusions urging greater efforts at dialogue and cross-community co-operation on the part of all parties in Iraq and also supporting increased political dialogue between the EU and Iraq.<\/p><p>  High Representative Ashton is likely to brief us at next week's meeting on the most recent round of negotiations between the E3+3 and Iran, which took place in Almaty in Kazakhstan on 5 and 6 April.  The overall level of progress made on this issue so far has been disappointing.  Substantial differences remain between the E3+3 and Iran over the steps the Iranians must take to address our very serious concerns about the country's nuclear programme.  No date has yet been set for the next round of talks.  The reality is that the window for making progress is closing rapidly as the presidential elections in Iran, scheduled for June, draw ever nearer.<\/p><p>  As I indicated earlier, the horrendous situation in Syria has dominated the Council's proceedings in recent months.

We all welcome communiqu&eacute;s and declarations.  It is the follow-up and the action, needed by so many international powers of major countries, that is vital.<\/p><p>  In regard to World Trade Organization talks, trade is part of the Minister's brief.  I note that the European Commissioner for trade is Commissioner de Gucht.   Does the need to conclude a plenary level WTO agreement feature in the Council of Foreign Ministers in view of the fact that it is important for the developing countries and from a development co-operation point of view?  We had the opportunity during Question Time on Holy Thursday to deal with most of the issues covered.  <\/p><p>  I wish to reflect on the situation in Syria.  Some 70,000 lives have been lost and there are a million refugees.  It is a desperate situation that needs the utmost consideration and whatever can be done must be done.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has provided additional humanitarian aid.  One of the concerns expressed by some of the groups who take a particular interest in that region is that the aid will not reach the people most in need.  There have been allegations that the humanitarian aid has been going in disproportionate measures to supporters of the Assad regime.  That is an important issue that should be dealt with and we need to get a message out that humanitarian aid provided by the taxpayer and the international community is reaching the people most in need and is not being abused by the supporters of one particular regime.   Russia's role continues to remain crucial.  Is there any sense of amelioration in its attitude?  The Minister made a statement here which I welcome that: \"Ireland does not favour any actions which could contribute to greater militarisation in the conflict.\"  It is important to keep reiterating that particular view and policy of the Government and, hopefully, of the European Union also.<\/p><p>  In regard to the Middle East peace process, I am pleased there has been a greater engagement by the US since President Obama's re-election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700017#R00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366215000,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I will take questions from another member before calling on the T&aacute;naiste to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700018#S00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1366215000,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in the negotiations and discussions to come.  He faces a difficult task with regard to the areas he must cover and I wish him well.  He began his speech by referring to the Middle East, the Palestinian situation in particular, and spoke about injecting urgently needed momentum into the peace process and discussions relating to it.  A position was adopted at a Council meeting 12 months ago in the context of settlement goods and strong conclusions were reached.  Now, 12 months later there have been announcements relating to a further escalation of settlement colonies.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe it is time to return to the issue of the settlement goods and a potential ban on those goods?  Is it possible that would bring about political momentum and raise awareness?  What specific steps will Ireland take to build on the call for an EU-wide ban on settlement goods and how will it progress action at the May Foreign Affairs Council meeting?<\/p><p>  With regard to Syria, the T&aacute;naiste mentioned he went through some of the refugee camps in neighbouring countries.  We are aware that prior to conflict breaking out in Syria, these countries had more than 1 million refugees from Iraq, Palestinian refugees and others.  These populations now face a new phase of difficulties.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the use of chemical weapons and expressed concern that it is possible they will be used.  Did the use of rape in the Syrian and other conflicts arise in discussions and will that issue be addressed?  In the case of Syria in particular, rape continues to be used by both sides and seems to be an almost institutionalised method used to break prisoners.  I presume this was part of the T&aacute;naiste's discussion with refugees.  What can Ireland do with regard to this?  We can certainly condemn the use of rape, but are there any active measures we can take on it?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the Irish Aid hunger-nutrition-climate justice conference.  What specific actions can the Government take to follow up on its recommendations?  The T&aacute;naiste said he will raise the issue, but what specific recommendations will he put to the meeting in response to the challenges outlined by President Higgins in his opening address, which focused on the detrimental impact of large scale land acquisitions, biofuel production and speculation in food commodities?<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste also spoke about the sectarian element that keeps breaking out in many areas of conflict.  Many of the countries in question are moving from secular societies towards fundamentalism.  Is there any policy with regard to support for those groups looking for change?  Have we a view on that?  What I would like to see emerging in many of these areas is a secular society where people are not discriminated against because of their religion, their gender, their sexual orientation or the colour of their skin.  Will this issue ever be discussed on the agenda of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Europe?<\/p><p>  With regard to the multiannual financial framework, MFF, negotiations to ensure that member states renew their commitment to 0.7% of GNI in aid, how will these commitments be met?

This was a very different conference because we designed it so there would be participation by people from grassroots level in developing countries like Malawi and we could bring together smallholders and people working on farms - some 80% of which were headed by women - and we linked together the themes of climate justice, hunger and nutrition.<\/p><p>  We can talk about these issues at international conferences which are based on expert reports and scientific research, but this conference was an opportunity to talk about these issues through the lens and eyes of people experiencing the issues directly in their daily lives and that was the strength of the conference.  The responsibility Ireland has taken on as a country arising from the conference is that we will take the messages from that conference to the international community.

I was able to attend the conference in Dublin Castle for most of the two days.  The speech given by President Michael D. Higgins on Monday morning set the tone for the conference.  It was a most powerful and passionate speech on inequality.  He did not mince his words as to where the fault lies.  The big powers must be taken on board if we are to address the issue of equality and inequality.<\/p><p>  The conference heard from local community voices such as those of fishermen, farmers, pastoralists and women.  They are amazing people considering what they are dealing with in their countries.  Their desire for and achievement of empowerment is very powerful.  The other message at the conference was that without the political will, no amount of empowerment will achieve anything.  It was notable to hear from speakers from all the global organisations, including former US Vice President, Al Gore, that Ireland is held in great respect.  <\/p><p>  I accept what the Minister says about overseas development aid but we cannot give with one hand and take away with the other.  I refer to his commitment to a 5% cap on bio-fuels.  This needs to be taken on board right across Europe because otherwise we are undermining what happened at that conference yesterday.  The President's speech was also very forceful about the small number of companies that control certain commodities such as food and confectionery.  I mentioned the tax issue previously and I know positive moves are being made.  I hope these will go further.  If the conference is to have any meaning, we have to be very proactive in what we want from it.<\/p><p>  Earlier today the committee had a very disturbing presentation from a member of the lesbian and gay community in Uganda.  The presentation highlighted the need for careful and considered diplomacy.  Ireland is good at such diplomacy.  I ask if we can promote this careful and considered diplomacy with regard to gay rights in Uganda.  The committee recently had a presentation from a group from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  It was frightening to hear about the increase in incidences of rape of young girls and women and also of young boys and young men.  Can these issues be raised by means of careful and considered diplomacy with government leaders in those countries?  The armies in those countries are involved in these crimes of rape.  It could be because the soldiers are not being paid.  In my view, there are plenty of dots to be joined up.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the positive aspects of the Arab Spring but there are very disturbing accounts coming from those countries of the disimprovement in the status of women.  Instead of access to education and employment and the right to go where they please, the situation for women is worse since the Arab Spring.  I would not like us to lose sight of that reality.<\/p><p>  I refer to the positive moves with regard to Cuba.  A US delegation recently visited the country.  The delegation made the point that the US does not wish to deal with a one-party state but it is very happy to trade with Vietnam which is also a one-party state.  I do not see why the policy cannot be applied to Cuba.  I ask if Ireland can play a supportive role with regard to Cuba.  The Labour Party supported it in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700020#U00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1366216200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Some of the issues raised by Deputy O'Sullivan may not be on the agenda for the Council meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700020#U00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1366216200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I have about five questions but I will try to hit the nail on the head and stop the waffle.  The Minister mentioned the Arab Spring, the wonderful revolutions in the Arab world.  Is he conscious of the reputed difficulties being experienced by the Coptic Christians in Egypt?  I refer to US Secretary of State, John Kerry's visit to the Holy Land and to Israel.  We have met with Arab Christian leaders of the Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox religions.  They were very unimpressed by the Secretary of State's presence in Israel, in so far as they were of the view that he was reinforcing the concept of the Jewish State.  As Arab Christians, they feel terribly under threat and their populations are being squeezed out.  They believe they are deemed to be second-class citizens in the Jewish state.  Is the Minister aware of the concerns of the Coptic Christians?<\/p><p>  The Gaza strip is currently controlled by Hamas which is imposing an Islamic form of education including the segregation of boys and girls at a certain age.  This is being done in the interest of establishing the cultural rights of those who believe in Islam.  The Jews are creating a Jewish State, an Islamic region is being created in the Gaza strip and the Christians - Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox - are feeling very squeezed out.  <\/p><p>  The Minister's comments about Russia are very interesting.  He said that less progress was achieved on the new agreement centred around energy and human rights:<blockquote>  However, as in any important relationship, there are issues where our interests, and indeed the values that define those interests, differ, and in March, Ministers discussed how best to communicate to Russia, in a frank and constructive manner, its concerns about worrying developments in respect of political pluralism and human rights within the country.<\/blockquote> This morning the committee was addressing the Magnitsky case.  We asked for an opinion from the Russian ambassador.  I will read the a portion of the response we received from him:  <blockquote>Unfortunately, the group of parliamentarians who initiated consideration of questions concerning the Magnitsky Act at the Irish Parliament took for a basis only naked assertions by the person who committed a number of economic crimes in the territory of the Russian Federation.  This approach certainly will not enrich bilateral Russian-Irish relations and can have negative influence on the negotiations on the adoption agreement between Russia and Ireland being progressed.  <\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700020#U00400","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366216800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I am pleased to welcome the T&aacute;naiste and to congratulate him on a number of successes, including the hunger, nutrition and climate justice conference.  I have a question on that.  I was not able to attend the conference - I was abroad - but I am very interested in it.  Was the issue of population raised at the conference, because it underlies everything?  People are notoriously shy about raising it, partly because religious leaders of various kinds seem to want to assert the dominant right to breed more members for their various creeds.  The world population is the single most dramatic change in my lifetime, and it underlies all these issues.  When I was in Trinity it was 3 billion.  By the time I will have croaked it, it will probably be 9 billion.  That is a threefold increase in one short human lifetime.  The planet cannot sustain it.  It is no wonder there are water shortages, tensions over other resources and so on.  Regardless of what way people massage the issue, the planet cannot support that number of people.<\/p><p>  I am delighted when I hear of a decline in the population in Europe and North America, the advanced countries, because we are the ones that do the most damage and are the most greedy for resources.  That is not an anti-sub-Saharan Africa position; it is much better when the numbers go down.  Was there any prominent mention of that, because the UN global population report never once in my experience ever mentioned that?  Female genital mutilation, the education of local tribal people and civilians caught up in conflict are very important issues, but they do not mention population, and it is so important.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe has reminded me about the situation in Syria where there are more than 1 million refugees.  The report to us speaks passionately about that.  Apparently, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has replied to a parliamentary question submitted by Deputy Crowe to the effect that we will resettle 30 Syrian refugees in Ireland in 2013.  Are the witnesses aware of the progress that has been made in that matter?<\/p><p>  Coming from the climate conference it is a great tribute to the former President, Mary Robinson, that she has been appointed to this significant position with regard to the Great Lakes region, including the Congo in particular.  Can the T&aacute;naiste give any indication as to the degree of support we will be able to give her there, because it is very important?  This committee, and the Seanad, have passed resolutions on violence, particularly sexual violence, in areas like the Congo.<\/p><p>  I am glad the issue of Uganda was raised.  It was an impressive report from a young woman who has been threatened.  She was a friend of David Kato of Front Line Defenders who some of us met in Dublin Castle.  He was subsequently murdered at the instigation of the media and the Christian churches in that country.  I know there is a problem in Britain at the moment, which was referred to by Deputy Crowe also, but I remember dealing with a number of cases, for example, where under the former Administration, not the T&aacute;naiste's Government, people were sent back to Iran by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on the basis that they could hide their sexuality.  People were returned to Iraq and Nigeria or other such countries on the basis that if they chose the right part of the country, they could survive reasonably well.  I would hate to think this would happen here.  Are there any such cases?  What is the status here and what would be the Government's attitude, because it is crystal clear that people are being murdered in Uganda as a result of their sexual orientation?  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on the brave work he has done in this area and I encourage him to continue it.<\/p><p>  There might be a possibility, since the Papal Nuncio is the doyen of the parliamentary-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700021#V00200","nonspeaker":"Senator David Norris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366216800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Senator, Uganda will not be on the agenda next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013041700021#V00300","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366216800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Okay.

At a dinner three years ago at which Mr. Dick Cheney was present, I had the opportunity to raise the Iraq-Iran situation.  Mr. Cheney conceded that Iran was a bigger threat than Iraq.  The intervention by the United States and the United Kingdom in Iraq was strongly criticised by many Members in these Houses.  The states that intervened now have a responsibility not to leave Iraq as the basket case it seems to be turning into.  Many Members present, including some of my colleagues, predicted this would happen.

We are having discussions with the European Parliament and Commission.  I was in Brussels last week and there was an informal meeting with representatives of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, under the Irish Presidency, on the MFF.  We intend to have further discussion at the meeting of the General Affairs Council next week and a further round of discussions with both the Parliament and Commission.<\/p><p>  There are major issues we have to overcome, including the Parliament's approach to the MFF itself.  Also of concern is the 2013 budget.  The budget proposed for development assistance represents an increase on the previous allocation.  The figure is not as high as originally proposed by the Commission but, given that the Union, as an institution, and the member states allocate over 50% of all development aid in the world, it is very high.  We are working on this and it is a great priority for us.  There will be a lot of work.  I will be happy to report further on it, probably to the Joint Committee on European Affairs or this one.<\/p><p>  Tackling the issues of rape in conflict, violence against women and girls, and gender-based violence is a long-standing priority for Ireland.  Rape is a terrible violation of human rights.  The issue is raised regularly by us at multilateral fora and directly with states.  We provide direct support for tackling the issue through Irish Aid.<\/p><p>  The issue of settlements and settlement produce was raised by Deputy Crowe and a number of others.  I wrote to this committee last November setting out in detail my view on settlement goods.  I support the view that place-of-origin labelling should not allow settlement goods to be misrepresented as coming from Israel or as being Palestinian, as the case may be.  My Department has carried informal advice on these lines on its website for some years.  I am considering how formal voluntary guidelines might be issued.  Ideally it would be at EU level.  There is work taking place on this.  With a group of colleagues, I recently wrote to Baroness Ashton to welcome her initiative in proposing to produce EU labelling guidelines and to encourage her in that regard.  She has written to member states setting out proposals in regard to guidelines that could be applied at EU level.  I am involved in consultation with other Departments on how we might address this.

The motions seek D&aacute;il approval of the terms of EU international agreements with South Africa, the Republic of Korea and Indonesia.  As members of the committee will be aware, the three agreements in question involve mixed competence.  This means that some of the areas covered by the agreements, such as economic co-operation and trade relations, fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union, while others, such as justice and home affairs, remain within the competence of member states.  For this reason, each EU member state is a party to these agreements and they can only formally enter into force after they have been ratified by all member states and endorsed by the European Parliament.  In Ireland's case, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is required prior to ratification whenever the terms of the agreement involve the possibility of a charge on public funds.  As it can take a considerable length of time before ratification procedures are completed in all 27 member states, arrangements are usually made for some aspects of the agreements to be applied on a provisional basis pending their formal entry into force at a later date.<\/p><p>  These new agreements with South Korea and Indonesia and the updating of the existing agreement with South Africa clearly signal the EU's intent to become a more effective global player.  Partnership and co-operation agreements with the Philippines and Vietnam have recently been signed and one with Mongolia is awaiting signature.  Negotiations on far-reaching agreements with Canada and Singapore are almost completed while trade talks are about to begin with Japan.  In addition, the EU is moving towards the opening of negotiations with the US on a landmark transatlantic trade and investment partnership.<\/p><p>  We can see that under the Lisbon treaty the EU has developed real instruments of foreign policy.  The framework and the tools are now in place to enable the Union to more effectively defend its values, promote its interests and be more present in the world.  Three years on from their creation, there is a fuller appreciation of the benefits of having a permanent President of the European Council, a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and a European External Action Service.  We are seeing greater coherence in the Union's external actions and more clarity in its interaction with its global partners.  This is important because in our globalised world the relationships that Europe builds with its key partners will determine its future prosperity.  I am aware that the committee has taken a strong interest in the human rights clauses in EU international agreements and I welcome this.<\/p><p>  I also wish to assure the committee that human rights concerns are fully integrated into the EU's approach to external relations. The purpose of agreements with partner countries such as those before us today is not just to increase trade and improve prosperity.  They also provide a framework for the EU to promote the principles and values on which the Union was founded, which are democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  Since 1995, the EU has implemented a policy of systematically including an \"essential element\" clause into all framework agreements with third countries, stipulating that respect for human rights and democratic principles forms the basis for the agreement.  The essential elements clause provides the legal basis for positive measures, such as human rights dialogues, as well as for negative measures in case of serious violations of human rights.<\/p><p>  I would like now to introduce the EU-Indonesia partnership and co-operation agreement to the committee for approval.  This agreement was signed in 2009 and, as of now, it has been ratified by 24 member states.  It was the first such agreement to be concluded by the EU with a country which is a member of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations.  The completion of negotiations with Indonesia demonstrated the EU's desire to strengthen its links with the region and it has paved the way for negotiations with a number of other ASEAN members, such as Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.<\/p><p>  The partnership and co-operation agreement will allow the EU to strengthen political dialogue and co-operation with Indonesia.  It will also provide the framework for closer co-operation in a wide range of policy fields, including trade and investment, environment, energy, education, science and technology, migration and counter-terrorism.  In addition, a new EU-Indonesia human rights dialogue was launched in 2009, which has resulted in intensified exchanges on human rights issues of mutual interest.  The agreement has also allowed for further development of intercultural exchange and engagement with moderate Islamic groups.  It has reinforced the EU's development co-operation programme in Indonesia, which supports, among other areas, democratisation; good governance; poverty reduction, including education; improvement of the trade and investment climate; tackling environmental problems; and promoting ASEAN co-operation.<\/p><p>  How does this agreement affect Ireland?  Currently, Ireland's relationship with Indonesia remains underdeveloped.  Our bilateral relations are maintained on a secondary accreditation basis from Singapore, with Indonesia's ambassador in London accredited to Ireland.  My Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, recently visited Indonesia as part of an overall trade-focused trip to south-east Asia over the St. Patrick's day period.  He was the first Irish Minister to visit Indonesia in over a decade.<\/p><p>  Indonesia represents a wealth of opportunity for Ireland.  With a population of 250 million it is the world's fourth most populous country.  Its GDP in 2012 was &euro;685 billion, making it the world's 16th-largest economy.  It has recorded economic growth rates of over 6% per annum for the past three years and it is predicted that by 2020 it will be the world's sixth or seventh-largest economy.  Trade with Indonesia is growing, albeit from a low base.  In 2012, Ireland's total merchandise trade with Indonesia was valued at &euro;162 million, an increase of 15% over 2011.  Total trade in services is also rising from &euro;141 million in 2010 to &euro;204 million in 2011.  There is considerable potential to increase trade and investment flows between Ireland and Indonesia from their current low levels.  There are also opportunities in services, including education and tourism.  This agreement provides part of the framework necessary for Ireland to take our relationship with Indonesia to the next level.<\/p><p>  I will turn now to the EU-South Korea framework agreement.  This agreement was signed in 2010 and to date it has been ratified by 20 member states.  The framework agreement was signed at the same time the EU upgraded its relationship with South Korea to that of strategic partnership.  This strategic partnership is underpinned by two agreements - the EU-South Korea free trade agreement, which is the first such agreement to be signed by the EU with an Asian country and which came into effect on 1 July 2011, and this framework agreement.  The framework agreement promotes economic growth and sustainable development through co-operation in a broad range of fields, including business co-operation, competition policy, science and technology, education, agriculture and the environment.  It also provides for strengthening co-operation in migration and combating organised crime and illicit drugs.<\/p><p>  The framework agreement with South Korea will allow the EU to engage with this important partner to addresses a wide range of areas of mutual international concern, such as non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human rights, co-operation in the fight against terrorism, climate change, energy security and development assistance.  The EU-Korea relationship is probably the most developed in terms of political and economic relations compared to other EU relationships in the region.  South Korea is and will remain in the future a major player in the global information and communications technology field, despite growing regional competition.<\/p><p>  In what way will this agreement affect Ireland?  Ireland's relationship with South Korea is firmly rooted in the economic sphere.  Our embassy in Seoul was opened in 1989, with a strong focus on building economic relations, and that focus remains today.  My Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, recently completed a visit to South Korea, where a key objective was to seek out new trade openings.  The entry into force of the new EU- South Korea free trade agreement offers scope for Ireland to generate new and significant export opportunities.  From information technology sectors to education to the food and beverage industry, South Korea represents a market in which Ireland is well positioned to do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013041700002#A00200","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366222200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for a comprehensive statement on those three international agreements.

I do not know the population of South Korea but it has the 15th largest economy in the world.  That demonstrates the need for Europe to have up-to-date agreements with those trading blocs.  I am glad that in each of the agreements, aspects related to democracy, human rights, climate change and the rule of law, things we take for granted, are included.  It is vital that the European Union is a force to ensure best governance and human rights protection in countries where we are involved in trade.<\/p><p>  In view of the conference earlier this week, every trade agreement Europe is finalising or reviewing should take account of climate change and environmental issues.

When we think of the technological competence available today, competence that could not have been envisaged a few decades ago, and we consider the issue Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan regularly highlights here and in the D&aacute;il, the huge untapped resources across the world, we can benefit from the huge technological advances to ensure we have proper access to unused resources, particularly when it comes to food production.

They have the growth in their population under control to some extent.  It is a large young population looking for middle-class trade.  It offers significant opportunities for Ireland.  In terms of opening an embassy, I wonder is it jumping the gun in advance of some kind of a trade agreement or should we circumvent that.  Everybody talks about getting into China.  There must be easier ways to develop trade than getting into China because everybody seems to be focusing on that.  Certainly, Indonesia gave me the impression of a county that was ready to start trading with the rest of the world and where incomes were getting to the stage where they wanted all that the West had to offer and were more than willing to buy them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013041700004#C00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1366222800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Is the Minister confident that the essential elements clause in all framework agreements is strong enough on human rights and the democratic principles, and if there was a legal case, would it be strong enough?<\/p><p>  I would make one other point about money laundering.

The Minister wished to assure the committee that human rights concerns are fully integrated in the EU's approach to external relations, but there are those who would argue, for example, in the free-trade agreements with Israel and Colombia where there are difficulties still on-going, which comes first given that human rights is linked-in with this.

It is already built into them.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputies Mitchell and Eric Byrne, the ratification of all member states is required for the agreements to come into force.  One should bear in mind that these are EU agreements with the countries concerned.  Of course, Ireland has separate bilateral relations and there is a trade relationship.  These agreements provide a framework for the trade and investment relationship and then a wider framework including the essential elements which deal with such matters as human rights.<\/p><p>  The most significant of those essential elements is what they do positively because they provide for a discussion and dialogue between the European Union and countries concerned, for example, on human rights issues.  Of course, it is true that we all are free at any time to raise such issues bilaterally with countries and the European Union is free to do so, but doing it in a structured way which involves the whole trade relationship adds much greater clout to the discussion.<\/p><p>  The European Union requires the inclusion of political clauses in agreements with third countries as a way of ensuring that the values and political principles of the European Union and its member states are upheld.  The agreements with Korea and Indonesia contain two political clauses - one on human rights, democracy and the rule of law committing all parties to the implementation of their human rights responsibilities and the other on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction requiring the parties to co-operate and contribute to countering the proliferation of such weapons.  The original agreement with South Africa contained a human rights clause while the revised agreement we are discussing today has added disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The human rights clause is an essential element of the agreement.  That means that the concessions which are contained in the agreement may be unilaterally suspended in the event of violation by any of the signatory countries.<\/p><p>  On the monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries concerned, one of the key ways that the EU monitors the human rights situations in countries is through its delegations on the ground which work in close collaboration with the bilateral member state missions.  The European Union maintains an open and frank dialogue on human rights with the representatives of countries with which it concludes co-operation agreements.  In the case of Indonesia and South Africa, human rights are the subject of a dedicated dialogue with the respective Governments.  These dialogues are forward looking and constructive and focus on concrete co-operation in the protection and promotion of human rights in the countries in question.  At a multilateral level, the European Union actively engages with partner countries, including at the UN Human Rights Council where, of course, all countries are subject to universal periodic review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013041700004#C00600","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1366222800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for his constructive engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013041700004#C00700","speaker":"974"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1366223400,"counter":619,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013041700005#D00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366223400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>The following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<blockquote>The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade has completed its consideration of the terms of the agreement between the European Community and the Republic of South Africa and the framework agreements between the European Union and the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Indonesia.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013041700005#D00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality","time":1366203600,"counter":622},{"type":"unspoken","content":"The Joint Committee met at 14:00","time":1366203600,"counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700002"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity: Discussion","time":1366203600,"counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700002#A00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366203600,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Brigid Quilligan, director of the Irish Traveller Movement, and thank her for coming before the joint committee.

The Irish Traveller Movement has more than 40 member organisations and a mandate to speak on their behalf and advocate for the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  Our submission includes details of Irish Travellers who number 40,000 in Ireland, 15,000 in Britain and 10,000 of Irish descent in the United States.  We have a shared history, cultural values, a language, customs and traditions which are recognisable and distinct to our own people.  We constitute an ethnic group on the basis of these distinct and separate cultural values and traditions which make us self-identify as a separate group and enable us to be identified by the majority of the Irish population as a separate group.  We have been recognised as an ethnic group by all major international human rights instruments and bodies in Europe and worldwide and by the major human rights instruments in Ireland.  Uniquely, we also have two distinct features which mark our difference.  We have a dual identity of being indigenous Irish and Travellers and an undisputed and historical experience of marginalisation and discrimination in the country to which we belong.<\/p><p>  Members will note from our submission that our legal argument is watertight.  There is no dispute among national and international legal experts that we constitute an ethnic group.  We self-identify as an ethnic group and others recognise us such.  I will speak about the impact of not being recognised in one's own country as an ethnic group.  No matter how many boxes we tick or how much we fulfil our requirements and responsibilities in Irish society, we still experience discrimination and prejudice in every area of life on a daily basis.  People justify racism against us by stating we bring it on ourselves. That is what the general Irish population thinks about us and we know this.  We feel the hate, as do our children.  We see the hate in the media and displayed by people in positions of responsibility, politicians, judges, the police, teachers and doctors.  We feel, see and experience it on a daily basis.  It is not good enough for the State not to offer us the protection to which we are entitled.  <\/p><p>  We are not speaking about major changes; we are speaking about people who have been on the island of Ireland for as long as anybody can record and recognition for the valuable contribution we have made to Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quilligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366203600,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quilligan for her powerful presentation.

The T&aacute;naiste is on record as having said that same-sex marriage is the human rights issue of our generation and I would agree with that.  I would also suggest, however, that for the Traveller community, the recognition of Traveller ethnicity is the human rights issue of our generation.<\/p><p>  We are disappointed at the persistent refusal of successive Governments to recognise what is self evident, namely, that we Travellers constitute a distinct ethnic group.  The Government has continued to ignore the opinions and recommendations of a range of eminent domestic and international bodies which have all said the Government should take concrete measures to recognise Traveller ethnicity.  The same eminent human rights bodies have also said, very clearly, that Travellers meet all the legal and academic criteria in terms of what constitutes ethnicity.  <\/p><p>  In particular, I want to draw the attention of the committee to general recommendation No. 8 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, which is the principle of the right to self identify, if no objective justification can be put to the contrary.  The Irish Government is immediately in breach of this principle because it has not explained or justified why it will not recognise Traveller ethnicity.  The mantra we consistently get is that there is a divergence of views within the Traveller community.<\/p><p>  While recognising that there are a number of individuals who disagree with the recognition of Traveller ethnicity, the four national Traveller organisations - the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Traveller Women's Forum, Pavee Point Travellers' Centre, and Minc&eacute;irs Whiden, a Traveller-only forum - all agree that Travellers do constitute an ethnic minority and should be recognised as such.<\/p><p>  Last September, at a conference organised in Dublin Castle by the National Traveller Monitoring Advisory Committee, NTMAC, 99% of the Travellers in attendance also agreed that we do constitute an ethnic minority and should be granted that status.  There was one dissenting individual.  <\/p><p>  Nowhere in international law does it suggest that a consensus is needed for the recognition of ethnicity to be granted to our people.  In the final analysis, it is irrelevant whether one agrees or disagrees.  It is about recognising that there are international objective criteria on what constitutes ethnicity.  It is against this that assessments and decisions ought to be made.  If this approach was adopted by the Government there is no doubt in my view that our ethnicity would be recognised.<\/p><p>  The 1976 Mandla<i> v.<\/i> Dowell-Lee judgment in the UK is of significant importance to Irish Travellers.  It gave a lengthy definition of an ethnic group.  I want to convey two essential elements to this committee.  One is that the group has a long shared history, of which it is conscious, distinguishing it from other groups and the memory of which is kept alive.  The second element is a cultural tradition of its own, including family, social customs and manners, often but not necessarily associated with religious observance.<\/p><p>  In 2002, this criterion was heavily relied on in the English courts in O'Leary and Others<i> v.<\/i> Allied Domecq and Others.  After long deliberation, the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Goldstein, concluded that Irish Travellers met this criterion and therefore should be recognised as an ethnic minority.  In addition, the 1997 Race Relations Order grants recognition to Travellers in the North of Ireland, yet in this jurisdiction we do not. <\/p><p>  In that context, we also suggest that the Irish Government is in breach of the Good Friday Agreement which refers to an equivalence of rights.  In other words, it is about harmonising legislation upwards.  If there is a piece of legislation in the North of Ireland which is inferior to our legislation, there is an obligation on the Northern Ireland authorities to enhance their legislation upwards.  Likewise, there is a corresponding obligation on the Irish Government to enhance our legislation.  Unfortunately, however, it has not done so.<\/p><p>  Our own Equal Status Act gives a very good definition of what constitutes ethnicity in all but name.  Traveller organisations have provided evidence, both legal and academic, which clearly suggests that Travellers constitute an ethnic group.  Therefore, under international law the burden of proof to the contrary now lies with the State, but it has failed to act.  As I said, the mantra we get all the time is that there is a divergence of views in the Traveller community.<\/p><p>  This is not some sort of academic or ideological debate.  Not to recognise Traveller ethnicity has profound implications in terms of legal protection.  It is questionable whether Travellers are afforded the full protection of the EU race directive.  There are also implications concerning support for Traveller nomadism, language, culture, history and the inclusion of Travellers in intercultural and anti-racism initiatives.<\/p><p>  As regards the ethnic question in our national census, we had to fight tooth and nail to get Travellers included in that because we were not recognised as an ethnic group.  In the end, we reached a compromise.  As well as practical implications, ethnicity also has a symbolic value.  It would be good for Travellers' self-esteem and confidence, as well as being important for our people's overall status in Irish society.  <\/p><p>  In our opinion, there needs to be an unequivocal recognition of our ethnicity either by way of legislation or constitutionally, or both.  In the absence of this unequivocal recognition, the subtext is that we are a dysfunctional, primitive community who need to be civilised and rehabilitated.  <\/p><p>  Ethnicity is fundamentally about recognition, respect and, by extension, inclusion.  It is about recognising our history, culture and language.  Let us be clear about it - this is not about saying that the more one claims ethnicity, the less one claims Irishness.  We are very proud of our ethnicity and we are also very proud of our Irishness.  We are willing, and demanding, to play our part in the Irish nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1366203600,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collins for his powerful presentation.

Through generations, where we were once a strong, proud people -  and for some part still are - we have been devalued within society.  Never before in my lifetime have I seen such hate as I have seen in the past five years.  If one opens a newspaper or turns on the television, if one is in a shop or on a train, if one looks at Facebook, Twitter, thejournal.ie or anything at all, anti-Traveller sentiment is fired at one.  As Travellers, we experience this in our daily lives and we try to set about changing that by making people aware of us and by working in partnership with people.  However, while we accept there is a certain tolerance from the people on the street, where it is happening more often is with people in positions of power who are coming out with absolutely outrageous anti-Traveller propaganda in the media in public open forums.  It is open season on Travellers, with little or no consequences for their actions.  When one is a Traveller, whether one is in the line of work we do or is a doctor, a hairdresser or anything else, be it getting involved or being a mother staying at home with one's children, when one sees such things in the media, one asks whether there is no law in the land of Ireland for one's people.  We ask if there no justice for our people if so much hate can be expressed towards us.  Like anyone, we internalise things.  If one is constantly told and fed negative things about one's self, one internalises them.  Certainly, we see some of our young people struggling with their identity and it is very hard, as a parent, to try to instil pride in one's identity because of all the hate one encounters.  I do not know whether anyone else wishes to add to this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quilligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366204200,"counter":636,"content":"<p>May I make a point pertaining to ethnicity?  One problem with the denial of Traveller ethnicity is that Travellers are not automatically included in anti-racism and inter-cultural initiatives, many of which are about promoting integration and mutual respect in Ireland.  Because this ethnicity is not recognised, the units in those Departments that are dealing with anti-racism and inter-culturalism actually do not include Travellers.  Consequently, Travellers have a unique experience of discrimination and we do not call it racism.  This, for us, is a key and core part of the debate regarding ethnicity, because if one recognises Traveller ethnicity, one recognises that racism is the root cause of discrimination with which Travellers are faced.  If one does that, one then seeks to address and challenge it in order that adults and children are not exposed to hate, racism and discrimination.  This is a fundamental problem.  The unit in the Department of Justice and Equality that deals with anti-racism and promotes inter-culturalism excludes Travellers.  Travellers are dealt with by the Traveller division, and this is hugely problematic.  For example, while the Government was developing the inter-cultural education policy, Travellers were excluded until we were obliged to bang down the door and demand to be included.  Moreover, we then are perceived to be difficult, awkward and always complaining, whereas, were we to be included as a right, our input would be planned.  As Mr. Martin Collins noted, we have campaigned for an ethnic question in the census since 1986.  We finally succeeded in getting one in the early 1990s and it was only a Traveller question.  When the ethnic question was introduced in 2002, Travellers were going to be excluded from it because they were not recognised as an ethnic group.  That is the reason the question in the census is what is one's ethnic and cultural background.  Really, however, the issue needs to be that ethnicity is recognised, that racism is named and that Travellers are included in anti-racism and inter-cultural initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay"},{"type":"speech","time":1366204200,"counter":637,"content":"<p>My second question is related, to an extent, and is specifically to do with the ethnic group aspect.

Both of these statutory human rights and equality organisations agreed.  Picking up on a concern raised by Ms Ronnie Fay, the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, that is being formed, with which I am sure all members are familiar, has an inter-culturalism remit.  However, because Travellers are not specifically named as an ethnic group, it is unclear whether Travellers will be included within that remit.

The reaction to the burning of a house allocated to a Traveller family in Donegal was disappointing.  There was a lack of courage and political leadership from most people, with a few exceptions, including Deputy Finian McGrath and Deputy Pringle.  In the absence of that, the signal being given is that it is open season on Travellers and one can attack Travellers with impunity.  This does not befit a western, civilised democracy.  The rule of law is being completely ignored.  I hope the culprits who were responsible will be brought to justice.  In fact, it is reported by the Garda this morning that after 61 days the incident has been found to be criminal damage and arson.  It was not an accident.<\/p><p>  With regard to good practice, in Romania the Roma are recognised as a distinct ethnic minority.  That is reflected in its constitution.  In Romania there is a model of good practice in political leadership.  Its national parliament has an affirmative action programme in which Roma are represented in the political system.  That is a model of good practice and is something that potentially could and should be replicated in the Irish context.  I agree with Brigid that recognising Traveller ethnicity is not a panacea or a cure-for-all, but it is a step in the right direction.  If that is the starting point, it must be supported by appropriate legislation and resources.  I can give an example.  I was in primary education for six years.  Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to get a secondary education.  In those six years I was in an exclusively settled environment and I was taught about settled history, settled people's culture and so forth.  That is quite valuable, but at no stage in those six years was my identity as a Traveller in Ireland affirmed and celebrated.  I am not a human rights lawyer but I suspect that if Traveller ethnicity was granted, under international law there would be an obligation on the State to ensure that our curriculum is inter-cultural and reflects diversity.  It would be different from what it is now, which is basically a monocultural system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1366204800,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their very persuasive and powerful presentations.

Their contribution to the evolution of the State has been largely overlooked.  We have been on the island since the 5th century and, in that context, are an integral part of it.  Travellers and settled people have a shared history.  As Travellers, we also, unfortunately, have a discrete history of oppression and persecution.

That is why, in terms of a legal framework, we would be better off considering this issue from an ethnicity point of view because ethnicity recognises a distinguishable group, but, within it, it allows people to be individuals also.  In other words, not every Traveller is in favour of having large elaborate headstones when a loved one dies.  Some Travellers like it and are quite flamboyant and extravagant, while others are more modest.  Likewise, some celebrations of christenings and weddings are flamboyant and extravagant, while others are not.  Similarly, some Travellers value nomadism, while others do not.  Some Travellers see language as valuable, while others do not.  It the same for settled people when it comes to ethnicity.

If one considers the composition of the D&aacute;il, it is 87% male, almost exclusively white, does not include anyone from a Traveller background, as far as we are aware, and has few Members from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual, LGBT, community.  Unfortunately, therefore, when one seeks to run for election some people use hatred of minorities as a political platform.  Given that minorities are powerless and do not have the same access to mainstream media as others or political power and people willing to advocate for them, the fear factor tends to win out.  Unfortunately, the Traveller community has been on the receiving end of prejudice, including in some disgraceful recent cases.  Individual councillors or Deputies who have made outrageous statements have never paid a political price for doing so.<\/p><p>  Inequality is incredibly destructive.  Discrimination and inequality impacts on the individual and his or her community and hangs over him or her for life.  I am delighted we are having a positive discussion about a step the country and travelling community wish to take.  A major healing process can take place between two groups that have probably never come to terms with each other.  This is what is so engaging, attractive and positive about the discussion on ethnic status for Traveller people.<\/p><p>  The international argument for ethnic status is undeniable.  Do the witnesses agree that it would be a wonderful step for the Traveller community, one which would also bring responsibility, and something the settled community will also have to embrace and celebrate?  Ethnic status must not be viewed as exclusively an issue for the Traveller community, as it is one for all of Irish society and one which everyone should feel part of and celebrate.  In response to the decision made at the weekend on gay marriage, some people indicated their marriage will be slightly diminished if we extend marriage rights to other people.  I ask the witnesses to nail the lie that ethnic status for Travellers will somehow diminish other people's sense of themselves or identity.  On the contrary, it is a major cause for celebration.  An argument based on the law of unintended consequences is always rolled out to oppose such steps. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700007#F00700","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366206000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Choosing not to recognise Traveller ethnicity has cost implications.  When one considers the context in which the Traveller community finds itself, educational outcomes for Travellers are much inferior to those of the settled community, few Travellers have an opportunity to go to post-primary education, never mind third level education, and the outcomes of accommodation policy are despicable.  The health inequalities between the two communities show that, on average, a Traveller man will live 15 years less than his settled counterpart and a Traveller woman will live 12 years less than her settled counterpart.  The infant mortality rate among Travellers is almost four times the national average.  Ms Quilligan referred to the suicide rate among Travellers, which is almost seven times higher than in the settled community.  There is also a significant and growing drugs problem in the community and an alcohol problem.  All of these issues are fundamentally tied up with the issue of identity and for these reasons, the issue of ethnic status has more than practical implications for us.  It has symbolic meaning to us in terms of our self-esteem, self-worth, confidence and status in society overall.  That is the point I was trying to make.  It is not some sort of academic, ideological or philosophical debate but an issue with practical and symbolic implications.  This is a core point and the reason ethnic status is the human rights issue for our generation, in the same way that same sex marriage will be the issue for many people, including Travellers.  The starting point, in the context in which we find ourselves, is that choosing not to recognise Traveller ethnicity has cost implications.<\/p><p>  I can only speculate as to whether the Government has done its own work and research which may show cost implications in recognising Traveller ethnicity.  While that may be the case, investment and parity of esteem are needed in the long term.<\/p><p>  There is a peculiar understanding about ethnicity in an Irish context in that we seem to attribute it to minority groups only.  People tend to overlook that there are also majority ethnic groups.  In the Irish context, settled people belong to a majority ethnic group.  I am not suggesting that all the members present practise the same traditions or hold the same values but they all belong to one ethnic group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700007#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366206600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>We cannot do that but we can certainly discuss the matter with various Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700008#G00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366206600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, could be invited to come before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1366206600,"counter":688,"content":"<p>We may end up inviting him to come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700008#G00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366206600,"counter":689,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's question, our communities are already in conflict.

We are known throughout the world for being generous, good-hearted and welcoming.  However, the question of Travellers relates to one of the last battles.  Very good-hearted and politically correct people still feel it is okay to openly discriminate against us, to make anti-Traveller comments and to use the \"K\" word in reference to us.  I refer here to conversations which take place around the dinner table in good, respectable homes and in good, respectable offices.  In these places, we continue to be discriminated against and spoken about as if we come from another world.  Recognition of our ethnicity would be a start in the context of commencing a dialogue, promoting respect and understanding between both communities and, hopefully, rolling back the years of conflict we have experienced.

It is extremely important that it should be recorded.  I have seen many old photographs of members of the Traveller community and, as a county councillor and a member of my local authority's Traveller committee, I received the magazine for a number of years.

We are in close contact with the Department of Justice and Equality's Traveller policy division on an ongoing basis in the context of the question of Traveller ethnicity.  The division is fully aware of our campaign during the past 25 years to have our ethnicity recognised.  I am sure those in the division are blue in the face listening to us.  We are of the view that there is a blockage somewhere along the line.  The division is the liaison between us and the various Ministers.  As Mr. Collins stated, we held a conference on ethnicity last September.  That conference was supported by the national Traveller monitoring and advisory committee, which comes under the remit of the Department.  With the exception of one individual, every Traveller present was in favour of our ethnicity being recognised.  The Department is, therefore, fully aware of our position on Traveller ethnicity.  We try to work with the Department in a collaborative way and we hope to work with it in an even more collaborative way on the issue of Traveller ethnicity.  We seek its support in respect of that matter.<\/p><p>  We also liaise with the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office.  The national groups meet representatives from the office once a year and we attend its conference.  Again, there is an issue in terms of our being recognised as an ethnic group.

It needs to be followed up with a policy and legal framework which can, in turn, create the conditions in which our existence and contribution to Irish society can be affirmed and celebrated.  Under international law, the right to self-identification is sacrosanct.  However, as a result of the hostile environment in which we live, it is easier for Travellers to choose not to be Travellers.  We need to reverse that and consider how we can create the conditions in which one's identity can be affirmed and celebrated.  There is no doubt that many more people would identify themselves as members of the Traveller community if we created a context in which our ethnicity is affirmed and celebrated and an infrastructure which supports that ethnicity.

International human rights and equality protections do not automatically include Travellers because Travellers are not recognised as an ethnic group.  I have made an interesting observation on the benefit of recognising Traveller ethnicity.  It is interesting that Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn needed to ask Ms Quilligan and Mr. Collins about their history.  All of the members before me are educated and we should know.  There are many versions of history.  As a woman, for example, I often feel women have been written out of history because history is written by men.  Travellers and their contribution have been written out of history.  We should have been taught it in school.<\/p><p>  There is more.  When I learned about Travellers in the civil, social and political education, CSPE, programme, it was about deprivation.  We do not learn about the richness of their culture.  Ethnicity recognition will bring about an enrichment of society by valuing an indigenous group.  It must be noted that there have been cuts to the Traveller education budget.  On average, &euro;17 million per annum used to be spent, but in 2010 that budget was cut totally.  Many of the special provisions, for example, the Traveller transport scheme and the allocation of special teachers, were axed.  That pain will be felt for generations to come.<\/p><p>  We should know the history of Travellers.

Coming from Kilkenny and having been a member of the local authority which was involved with the Traveller community, I want to focus on a specific comment made by Ms Quilligan on a matter of which I was not aware, namely, the suicide rate among the Traveller community.<\/p><p>  In the context of our discussion on ethnicity, is there practical discrimination?  I agree that there is casual discrimination, even among people who regard themselves as educated and politically correct and who throw around phrases not heard in the past.  I often speak with my mother.  She is elderly, but she refers to the symbiotic relationship between small rural farmers and the Travellers who visited areas during the summer while she was growing up in the 1940s and 1950s.  As Ms Fay mentioned, that relationship changed in the 1960s and 1970s.<\/p><p>  Is there a denial of access to services?  While the settled community has always regarded mental health issues as a taboo subject, are they even more so in the Traveller community?  It is probably too much to expect a brief explanation, but why is there such a significant disparity in the rate of suicide between the Traveller community and the settled community?<\/p><p>  Mr. Collins is right about newspaper headlines.

Consider any minority across the globe that has been marginalised or excluded for generations, for example, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia or America or the Maori of New Zealand.  The suicide rate among such peoples is higher than it is among the majority population.<\/p><p>  Ms Fay and Mr. Collins, whose organisation deals with health matters more than ours, might address my next point.  There is an issue in accessing mental health services.  If Travellers can access them, they must then justify their culture to their counsellors.  Some Travellers do not have access to a doctor because they cannot register with one.  A difficulty is presented by the fact that it is not culturally appropriate to access mental health services and that the person with whom the Traveller is dealing does not value that culture.  Not only must one discuss one's mental illness, but one must also justify one's ethnicity.  That has been my personal experience, but, of the Travellers present who I know, each has been impacted on by suicide.  It is an epidemic.  I come from Killarney and the number of people close to me who have passed away through suicide in recent years is shocking.<\/p><p>  A component of this issue is the crisis of identity and not feeling part of anything.  People need to have a sense of belonging.  Thank God for the increased awareness of the fact that good mental health is as important as physical well-being.  Mr. Thomas McCann, a Traveller psychotherapist, refers to the link between mental health and oppression.  The effect on our people is staggering.  It is a generational issue.  My earliest incident of discrimination was as a four year old in school.  My young son is 13 years of age and attends a good school that has good policies, yet everyday he must correct someone who uses the word \"knacker\" and act like an advocate for his community.  Can members imagine the weight on a 13 year old's shoulders?  If someone makes an anti-Traveller comment, he feels he must correct it.  This happens everywhere our children go.  It is no surprise that the suicide rate is higher, but I am sorry that I am not able to elaborate further on the matter.  Perhaps Ms Fay might contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quilligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366207200,"counter":703,"content":"<p>To put the matter in context, one of the main human rights abuses being experienced by Travellers relates to health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013041700009#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366207800,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I am sorry I was late and missed the presentation.

We read with interest the transcript of the committee's interaction on 27 March with the three main sports bodies.  I have been playing sport since my early teens and only gave up contact sports after five years of playing over-35s soccer.  Like the majority of Irish adults, I, too, drink alcohol.  I continue to enjoy watching and attending all sports codes and agree that sports organisations have a very important part to play in the social life of the country.  I was, therefore, saddened by what the heads of the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA had to say to the committee on 27 March.<\/p><p>  I would like to concentrate in my presentation on the influence of alcohol marketing.  Alcohol marketing and advertising does work.  It influences young people's alcohol beliefs and behaviour.  The alcohol companies would not spend so much on marketing and advertising if it did not work.  That is obvious.  We have much evidence that young people exposed to alcohol branding begin drinking at an earlier age and that this can lead to dependence in adulthood.  The younger a person is when he or she commences drinking alcohol the greater the chance he or she will have a dependency problem from his or her 30s onwards.<\/p><p>  A study commissioned by the Department of Health in 2001 showed that alcohol advertisements were the favourite among children.  They are expensive to produce, but obviously they are the best advertisements.  A study in the United States in 2006 showed that young people who watched more alcohol advertisements on television were more likely to have drunk beer.  It also showed that for each dollar spent on alcohol advertisements alcohol consumption increased and that drinking by people brought up in more advertising rich environments plateaued in their late 20s, while drinking by people exposed to alcohol marketing plateaued in their early 20s.  As such, what one is exposed to as a teenager has long-term effects.  Another study in Australia and New Zealand showed that sports people exposed to alcohol sports sponsorship had higher drinking scores.  In this study approximately 600 people in New South Wales were asked about their exposure to sports sponsorship in their sports organisations.  There was a link between sports sponsorship and their drinking behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700004#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1366193400,"counter":744,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting, but a vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700004#G00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1366193400,"counter":745,"content":"<p>As we have eight minutes before we need to leave for the vote, Professor Barry can continue his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700004#G00500","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366193400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>The third study was an across-Europe study and involved 13 longitudinal studies which tracked people over four time periods.  It showed that young people who were exposed early to alcohol marketing were more likely to commence drinking earlier or, if already drinking, were more likely to drink more.  There was what was termed a \"dose response\", namely, the more one was exposed the more one drank.  The statement that alcohol advertising does not influence behaviour is not true.  There is a great deal evidence to the contrary.<\/p><p>  The sports bodies and the alcohol industry are incorrect when they state there is no evidence that sports sponsorship by drinks companies influences children to drink.  The measures we are hoping will be introduced to break the link between sports bodies and alcohol marketing are a crucial part of our response as a country.  We have a big drinking problem and many young people are storing up trouble for themselves and their families in the future.  Sport is a very important part of our culture and long may it remain so, but let it not be dependent on alcohol money as seems to be the case.  The alcohol industry is making money from sports sponsorship.  Those involved on the health side believe there should be reduced alcohol sponsorship of sports.  Unfortunately, the sports bodies are very much in the pocket of the alcohol industry, which is a shame.  We would like them to take our point of view on board.  I appeal to members of the committee, as legislators, to implement some of the recommendations made.  Self-regulation does not work, as we have seen to our cost in other areas of public life.  <\/p><p>  I will be happy to elaborate on any of these points or answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700004#G00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1366193400,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Barry for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700004#G00700","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1366194000,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Will Dr. William Flannery of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland make his opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700005#J00100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366194000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I am the chair of the faculty of addiction psychiatry of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The college has repeatedly called for the implementation of evidence-based measures to reduce alcohol-related harm.  Such measures include pricing, reducing availability and banning the promotion of alcohol.  In 2008, the college issued a policy paper calling for a ban on all alcohol advertising and sponsorship in Ireland, particularly given the evidence of adolescent alcohol-related harm.  Since then, additional national and international research has outlined the extent of alcohol advertising targeted at adolescents.<\/p><p>  Internationally, the British Medical Association, BMA, which advocates for the health of the public, has examined the damaging effect of alcohol marketing on young people.  It concluded alcohol marketing communications have a powerful effect on young people and are independently linked with the onset, amount and continuation of their drinking.  Through the use of TV, social networking, sponsorship of music and sporting events, they reinforce and exaggerate strong pro-alcohol social norms.  Its first recommendation was to ban all alcohol marketing communications.<\/p><p>  The scientific opinion of the Science Group of the European Alcohol and Health Forum found consistent evidence to demonstrate an impact of alcohol advertising on the uptake of drinking among non-drinking young people and increased consumption among existing drinkers.  A survey in New Zealand found that sports people receiving direct alcohol industry sponsorship reported more hazardous drinking than those not receiving sponsorship.  Finally, the World Health Organization has stressed the critical importance of delaying the onset of drinking in young people.<\/p><p>  Suicide is the leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds in Ireland.  We have the fourth highest rate of youth suicide in the EU.  Research from the National Suicide Research Foundation in 2010 found that alcohol was involved in 24% of all cases of deliberate self-harm, that is attempted suicide, which rose to 44% for male cases.  The association between alcohol and attempted suicide appears self-evident given the timing of peak presentation to accident and emergency departments around midnight on Sundays, Mondays and increasingly on or after public holidays.  More research from the National Suicide Research Foundation shows suicides among men rose sharply as the economy went into recession with higher rates for those in the construction industry and having a harmful drinking pattern.<\/p><p>  Given these facts, I am disappointed at the drinks industry behaviour towards the national substance misuse steering group.  The aim of the group was to develop an alcohol strategy to run alongside the national drug strategy.  The college, the drinks industry and representatives from other areas of health, community and government were there.  The college believed all present were acting in good faith and over two and a half years worked to reach a consensus.  The group issued its report just over a year ago.  Despite being in the group, the drinks industry chose to stand aside and issue a minority report.<\/p><p>  At a personal level, I have been working in psychiatry now for 15 years.  One of my first training positions was in child psychiatry where every morning the patients greeted me with &ldquo;Whassup&rdquo;.  This was a slogan for Budweiser at the time.  These patients were children, the majority under the age of 12.  It is these children who picked up on this advert who are now adults and making headlines about being drunk in Australia.<\/p><p>  I now run an addiction service in the midlands and most of the patients are dependent on alcohol - that is, alcoholics.  As anyone who knows an alcoholic is aware, denial is a strong feature of the illness.  They are convinced they need alcohol to be normal, to be happy and to function.  I hear the same language from those who have alcohol sponsors with statements such as \"Without alcohol our sports, music or culture events will not happen\" or \"We need alcohol sponsorship to have major tournaments or to run our organisation\", or \"Alcohol is our culture\".  Denial is very powerful.<\/p><p>  Sadly with some of my patients, my advice and that of their family, friends and work colleagues is ignored and they continue drinking to their death.  Since 1990 there have been 11 committees and 15 reports giving advice on how to tackle alcohol-related harm.  Just as the call to drink responsibly for an alcoholic does not work, I ask this committee to call a stop to the promotion of the drinks industry and call for a ban on all alcohol advertising and sponsorship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700005#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. William Flannery"},{"type":"speech","time":1366194300,"counter":751,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Barry, Dr. Smyth and Dr. Flannery for their strong views and presentation and thank them for coming before the committee.

I refute the suggestion that a ban on the advertising of alcohol would inhibit those programmes and would ask the associations to give the committee the hard figures on that.

If I was working for the alcohol industry, I would be doing what it is doing and trying to minimise the harm my product causes and trying to associate it with positive health.  This issue first arose about 2002 and the industry was concerned then that a ban would be introduced before the 2002 soccer world cup.  A generation of youngsters has been exposed to alcohol advertising since then and we have a very young age for the onset of drinking.  Other sponsors could be found for sporting organisations, such as sponsors from the mobile technology area.<\/p><p>  Reading between the lines of what the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU have said, there are probably differences in the degree of dependence on alcohol sponsorship.  However, it is unacceptable that our major sporting bodies are dismissing the evidence and saying they must continue to get funding through alcohol sponsorship.  We have a duty of care to our children.  Clubs must not be under any illusion that if they accept alcohol sponsorship, this will not increase drinking among young people.  They cannot pretend this is not a problem.

They are right in saying that we are legislators and have a job to do in terms of bringing forward proposals.  This is never easy.  We have been presented with facts from Alcohol Action Ireland, but I am not overly taken by what has been presented.  Perhaps the group can give us more backup data.  We have also had presentations from the sporting organisations, but two of them made a lazy sort of assertion that life will not go on if they do not continue to receive this sponsorship.  The GAA pretty much said that a ban on this sponsorship is not a deal breaker and it can survive.<\/p><p>  The way I look at this is that we have a dreadful culture of abuse of alcohol.  This is a cultural issue that existed before modern sport emerged in a televisual way and had more to do with an ancestral culture passed down from generation to generation.  Perhaps we need to consider this.  The sporting organisations made the point here when questioned on whether alcohol advertising had the potential to encourage the misuse of alcohol that it did not.  They also felt that it did not encourage the increased consumption of alcohol.  They made the point that the pie was so big and there were so many competitors for a slice of it, making sponsorship more about brand awareness and developing brand loyalty than about targeting or increasing the sale or consumption of alcohol.  What is the group's view on that?  Some people take a bland approach and see sponsorship and brand development as part of advertising.<\/p><p>  If we are to proceed as Alcohol Action Ireland recommends, there is an issue with regard to the practical implications.  One would have to consider how we could block content from other jurisdictions.  We live in a very open world where the flow of content is televisual, on the Internet, on the phone and on the iPad etc.  How can we prevent information presenting alcohol in a good light getting to young people?  It is all very well that the alcohol companies will no longer sponsor the local soccer club, but young people already access content in a mobile way over which we do not have any control because it is sourced from jurisdictions outside of ours.

The Deputy asked about the bigger picture.  There are approximately 40 recommendations, across many domains, in the substance misuse strategy.  Some of the recommendations relate to the availability of cheap drink.  It has been recommended that corner shops should not be able to sell drink as they can at present.  The approach that has been taken with regard to drink-driving has been very successful.  There has been a big improvement on the roads as a result of the legislation that was needed in that case.  Some of the recommendations relate to marketing, promotions and culture.  Sport and music are the two biggest forms of culture that grab the hearts and minds of Irish people of all ages.  There is strong evidence that the potential and the reality of people drinking more - particularly younger people - increases when the alcohol industry gets itself gripped onto sports.  We are all pro-sport.  Our problem relates to the sporting bodies.  I think the GAA is different because it has alternative strategies.

As the committee knows, all of this is being discussed in the hope that some sort of political position will be reached soon.  Our position is that the process of phasing out the alcohol sponsorship of sports should be commenced.  It is doable.  Of course it will not sort out everything.  The overall aim is to reduce consumption of and harm caused by alcohol by approximately 15%.  If there are fewer people in trouble, there will be less pressure on the health service.  We are not here because this is a trivial issue.  It is a very serious issue.  It is important to address marketing by encouraging the sporting bodies to seek funding from other avenues.  I would like to refer to a suggestion that was made in one of the newspapers I mentioned.  In Australia, it has been proposed that the taxes collected through excise duty on alcohol should be used to fill the gap.  Of course we do not want the sporting bodies to struggle.

The French people and the French Government became very concerned about alcohol consumption levels in the 1980s.  A complex multi-pronged strategy was introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  This included a ban on sponsorship and severe restrictions on advertising.  Over the following four or five years, <i>per capita<\/i> consumption decreased by approximately 50%.  The point made by the sporting organisations is that youth drinking, specifically, has increased slightly in France in recent years.  If that is an indication of the inability of sponsorship curtailment to solve the drink problem, that should not come as news to anyone.  It is a multifaceted problem.  The escalation in drinking among young people in France is reflected across the Mediterranean.  Perhaps youth culture is becoming more homogenised as a result of the influence of MTV, etc.  It has been suggested that drunkenness among people in this age range has become more acceptable in Mediterranean countries than it used to be.  That has nothing to do with sports sponsorship.  The short-term impact of the French prohibition on sports sponsorship, as part of a broader suite of measures like those recommended in our substance misuse strategy, was to reduce consumption and, importantly, to reduce harm.  We do not want people to drink less for the sake of it - we want to see fewer body bags, fewer suicides and fewer people in our emergency departments, psychiatric hospitals and prison cells.<\/p><p>  Both Deputies asked how we propose to deal with the challenge of alcohol-related content.  The French have laudably stood alone in Europe by insisting on restrictions, at significant costs to local organisations.  When we watch Champions League matches from France, we do not see the Heineken logo.  Similarly, the Heineken Cup is known as the H Cup in France.  Ireland needs to decide whether it will wait for everyone else, or whether the problem is currently bad enough to justify showing some leadership on this issue as we did in the case of the smoking ban, when the world followed.  We need to put these actions in place while advocating loudly and consistently at European level to get our colleagues in Europe to follow what we do.  I understand that Norway is putting restrictions in place as we speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700007#L00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bobby Smyth"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366194900,"counter":769,"content":"<p>We keep hearing that there is a lack of scientific evidence.

We talked about the sporting bodies at national level.  At local level clubs would have difficulty in paying for insurance, transport and a kit unless the local pub sponsored them.  It may not be a large amount of money but the sponsorship is crucial to the running of the under-eights, under 12s and under 16s teams.  What are the alternatives?  If they go to the banks, they will take the shirts off their back and will certainly not sponsor their kit.  They do not have that many options.  That is my first concern.  To some extent that issue might be addressed through phasing in but we or somebody needs to identify alternative sources of financial support if the sports companies are to deliver the benefits that I see in my local community, particularly at under age level and in teenage teams.<\/p><p>  Is there any research or data that identifies the level of alcohol abuse, the level of suicide or self harm attempts among young people who commenced drinking before the legal minimum age?

I am in favour of a total ban on sponsorship of any of the national sports by alcohol companies.  Just as some people become dependent on alcohol, cocaine, hash, and so on, the drinks companies, very cleverly, have manoeuvred in the past 20 or 30 years into a situation where the major sporting bodies depend on them.  I cited an example when the sporting bodies appeared before the committee.  People ask where the sporting bodies will get their money from as if the only commercial operations in the country were alcohol companies.  We all know they are not.  We also know, or at least we should face up to the fact, that none of the other commercial operators can compete with the alcohol industry because they have more money.  That is the reality.<\/p><p>  The French Government was quite right to phase alcohol sponsorship out in 1991.  It did so very cleverly.  I heard some rubbish coming from the alcohol industry in relation to the French experience.  These people should take a look at the report prepared two years after the ban, after the phasing out of sponsorship of the sports bodies by alcohol companies in France.  I will give one example.  There was a decline in domestic violence.  These people never mention that.  I represent a constituency which is almost exclusively working class.  People stand up and say that the alcohol thing in Ireland is a cross-community issue.  It affects all the community but it affects working class people much more.  One has only to ask a primary school teacher in a working class community and he or she will tell one all about it.<\/p><p>  The phrase \"being in denial\" was used.  That alcoholics are in denial is true.  There are more people than alcoholics in denial.  Irish society is in denial.  On the basis of the number of reports that came out of this House, most politicians are in denial.  There are so many reports that one could actually build a barricade on Kildare Street, but none is ever acted upon.  One of the glaring examples of the lack of courage among politicians to deal with the national drug - it is a gateway drug and not a soft drink - was when the controversy arose about head shops.  I know nothing about head shops except what I read.  I was not a member of this esteemed body when the head shops became an issue.  There was such a flurry around here that within a matter of weeks the head shops were banned.  I do not know how one can calculate the damage caused by head shops compared to what the national drug has cost over the years.  It costs &euro;3.4 billion every year in domestic violence, courts services, etc.  There is an issue here that needs to be addressed.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700008#M00300","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366195500,"counter":773,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy Colreavy, one of the strategies is community mobilisation.

The joint committee has a sports remit.  In that regard, I want to touch on a question posed by Deputy O'Mahony.  In the suite of recommendations what is the priority or urgency of the proposed phased ban on sponsorship?  I have a concern.  If sponsorship was to be phased out, the national sports bodies could easily fill the gap.  Information and communications technology accounts for some &euro;60 billion, or 35%, of total exports, but I rarely see the brands of companies in that sector in sports organisations.  They are missing.  The drinks industry has a very active advertising budget and uses its initiative on how it is spent.  If a ban is phased in or imposed, the industry will not invest 40% of its advertising budget somewhere else.  Drinks companies will advertise where young people are.  One might see them advertising on games consoles.  While advertising money may not come to sports organisations, it may go to sports personalities, subliminally.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony touched on the club issue.  I have not reached the lofty heights reached by the Deputy in the GAA, but I was an active club footballer and coach.  When I started, it was tolerated to have a drink a few days before a championship match.  Now, it would not be unusual for a club player to avoid alcohol and bars for three or four weeks before a game.  In the national arena, however, one reads in the gossip columns about sports personalities who have been out for the night after a Premiership or FA Cup game, even though there is another game a week later.  It becomes acceptable again.  This is where we have a problem when it comes to sport.  The national side will look after itself and the GAA seems to have a strong, different opinion.  I have seen in the case of one club in County Kerry that it cost &euro;30,000 to get to an all-Ireland final - to put jerseys on 30 guys to get them to the end of a championship campaign.  Alcohol would not have been a feature of the lives of these 30 guys for eight months of that year.<\/p><p>  The problem for the committee is how to make one policy fit all.  I am concerned that the effort would slip sideways and that the advertising budgets of drinks companies would be spent in areas which were not as public or as well supervised and which might be even more threatening to the well-being of younger people.  If the delegates have a view on this, I would be very interested to hear it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041700009#N00300","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1366196100,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I had worries about alcohol advertising in sport and elsewhere before I attended the committee, having read quite a bit about the subject.  Some of the things the heads of the main sports organisations said to the committee on the last occasion were astounding.  They did not fit with what I had read about the damage sponsorship by drinks companies of sports events and in general caused.  Having listened to the delegates, I would like to have a look at some of the studies to which they have referred.  I believe what they are saying, which is that it is not good and is, in fact, very bad.<\/p><p>  The suggestion that the main sports organisations are dependent on sponsorship is true, which they showed by saying at our meeting that sponsorship was not the problem but the selling of alcohol in supermarkets at low prices.  That argument is not good enough.  It is the sort of argument I have with my daughters when one of them does something wrong and tries to get off by suggesting her sister has done something even more wrong.  That does not actually let the first child off.  They have still done something wrong and it needs to be changed.  In fairness to the sports organisations, they told us that if they could get the money somewhere else, they would not go near sponsorship by drinks companies.  We must listen to this.  They need the money and will not have it if we ban such sponsorship.  We must find another way to get the money.<\/p><p>  There was a suggestion about using the money generated through excise duties for sport.  The committee has been told that alcohol abuse costs the country &euro;3.4 billion every year.  If we could reduce the figure by 1%, it would save the State &euro;34 million.  We did not get a figure from the three main sports organisations the last day, but from what they told us, I get the impression that the money they receive through sponsorship does not amount to much more than &euro;34 million.  The delegates have made it quite clear that it is not good to have a connection between sport and the alcohol industry and I cannot see how anyone could argue with them.  If we ban alcohol advertising within sport, we must start to explore alternative revenue streams.  If it means putting an extra penny on a pint or a short and investing the revenue generated in sport, it must be done.<\/p><p>  Alcohol advertising should not only be banned in sport, it should be banned full stop.  The idea that one would promote - another word for which is \"push\" - a drug to young people cannot be accepted.  In reality, people will drink in any event.  I drink and like to do so.

The tobacco industry spends as much on the marketing and promotion of its products now as it ever did.  It just does it in a different way.  Marketing will not go away but marketers will not be given direct access to our homes via sports sponsorship.  It will become less convenient, more expensive and less efficient for the companies to market alcohol.  I will use a brief anecdote to illustrate this.  I asked my eight year old son to name a cigarette brand, and I encourage the committee members to do likewise if they want evidence that bans do work.
