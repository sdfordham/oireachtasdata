This issue has a personal priority for me since I took up office as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Ireland and the EU support political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace. Ireland and the EU also engage in action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity, which is progressively endangering prospects for a peace agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent months the new United States administration has been actively exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement.  This engagement is welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work, and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused. <\/p>  <p>  I was very disappointed at the US announcement recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and initiating steps to move the US Embassy, which I believe was premature and ill-advised, and unhelpful to efforts to resolve the conflict in the Middle East.

I had a frank discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the prospects for returning to negotiations between the parties, and how Ireland and the EU can play a constructive role in the MEPP. <\/p>  <p>  I also had the opportunity to meet with Palestinian President Abbas, whom I met again at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday, and urged him to keep an open mind on any proposal the US may bring forward.

This issue arises, for instance, in the case of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory or in occupied Syrian Golan. Ireland and the European Union do not recognise these settlements as legal and do not provide assistance to their development.  We maintain very clearly the position that these settlements are illegal, and harmful both to the Palestinian people, and to the prospects for peace between Israel and its neighbours. Ireland supports normal trade access for Israeli goods and services to the EU single market, consistent with the treatment of other countries with which the EU has trade and political agreements (many of which are the subject of very serious human rights concerns).  However, Ireland has argued successfully that any rights granted to Israel under these agreements cannot be applied to Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory, and in response the EU has acted in a number of ways to give effect to its disapproval of, and long standing position of opposition to, illegal Israeli settlements:   <\/p>  <p>  - Goods from settlements are excluded from the low tariff rates applied to Israeli goods.<\/p>  <p>  - EU funding may not be disbursed to Israeli entities based in settlements.<\/p>  <p>  - Ireland and a number of EU Member States have published advice to citizens and businesses against investing in, or engaging in any form of economic activity with, settlements.<\/p>  <p>  - EU-wide guidelines on labelling of goods from settlements <\/p>  <p>  In discussions at EU level, I am open to considering in principle any proposal that the European Union should exclude products from illegal settlements from entering the EU market.  However, the inescapable fact is that there is no prospect of such a proposal in relation to Israeli settlements gaining wider support at present.  <\/p>  <p>   My Department will carefully examine any proposed plans that may be put forward relating to the prohibition, at a national level, of imports from, or the sale of goods to, territories that are under occupation as defined by international law.  It is, however, necessary to caution that international trade between the European Union&rsquo;s Member States and third countries is regulated by the EU&rsquo;s Common Commercial Policy and is a matter of exclusive Union competence.  As a result, the scope which is afforded to a Member State to take such action is both limited and, naturally, governed by EU law including Regulation 2015\/478 on Common Rules for Imports.<\/p>  <p>  Any action by one Member State alone would raise not just legal, but also numerous practical problems.  In any case, it is my firm view that an action of this type sends an effective signal only when pursued by a group of countries, sending a signal of international opinion on the issue.  A coordinated EU policy is the only method that will have the potential to bring about change.  The impact which this type of coordinated response can have was evident in the EU&rsquo;s import ban on goods from, and restrictions on exports to, Crimea and Sevastopol, following their illegal annexation by Russia.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to draw a clear distinction between settlements in occupied territory, and Israel itself, and to reiterate that the Government does not support the policy known as &lsquo;BDS&rsquo; in relation to Israel. This has been the position of every Irish Government. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains a strong and consistent critic of Israeli policies relating to the occupation, and in particular those connected with the construction of settlements on Palestinian land.  We make those criticisms clearly and directly to the Israeli authorities, and in discussions in the EU and other relevant international fora.

Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, and attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN Human Rights Council, as well as at the Council of Europe and the OSCE. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty.  We oppose and condemn its use in all circumstances, and in particular in cases where there are allegations of unfair trials preceding its implementation.  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities, and my Department regularly conveys our stance on this issue to all countries where the death penalty is still in use. <\/p>  <p>  The conflict in Yemen, now in its third year, has led to grave concerns about human rights and Ireland has worked in the UN system to address these. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland joined the small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen, which established a group of international experts to investigate the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  Among other pressing issues, this resolution expressed concern at the severe restrictions on freedom of religion or belief in Yemen, including for members of the Baha&rsquo;i faith. Ireland calls on all parties to immediately release all Baha&rsquo;i detained in Yemen due to their religious belief, to cease the issuance of arrest warrants against them and to cease the harassment to which they are subjected. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from this Department also remain in contact with representatives of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland, with whom they have discussed the situation in Yemen, and will continue to monitor the situation closely.<\/p>  <p>  My Department necessarily prioritises its efforts to promote improvements in the general human rights situation, as it does not have the capacity to actively pursue at EU and international level all of the individual cases that arise.  Accordingly, my Department will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Yemen, as well as the issues of freedom of religion and the death penalty, and will take every appropriate opportunity to advocate for them. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, a real improvement in the human rights situation in Yemen will require an end to conflict. I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to support all efforts towards a negotiated settlement to the conflict in that country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300068#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Permanent Structured Co-operation","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300068#WRE00700"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[2956\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300068#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the implications of Ireland&rsquo;s recent endorsement of PESCO with its binding commitment to yearly increases in defence spending for wider international work on disarmament; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>The decision by Ireland to participate in Permanent Structured Cooperation, approved by the Government on 21 November 2017 and endorsed by the Dail on 7 December 2017, in full accordance with the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, has absolutely no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s wider international work on disarmament.Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) is a mechanism provided for in the Treaty of the European Union (Articles 42.6, 46 and Protocol 10), to enable countries to come together and, on a project by project basis, jointly develop military crisis management capabilities for use in support of CSDP Operations.  Ireland has been a consistent supporter and full participant in the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), in particular ensuring ongoing support for the UN and multilateralism and its capacity to contribute to international peace and security operations. As one of the main contributing countries to CSDP missions we have also been fully engaged in developing the PESCO concept.

The property valuation must be determined on a specific &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; and forms the basis for the LPT charge until the next &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo;. The first &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; for LPT was 1 May 2013 and the valuation of a property set on that date remains valid until 31 October 2019, following legislative amendments in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Amendment Act 2015. The 1 May 2013 valuation is not affected by any subsequent improvements or extensions to a residential property. Likewise, where a property is sold during the valuation period, and the value of the property has increased, there is no additional liability to LPT providing the initial 2013 valuation was accurate.<\/p><p>To assist with the calculation of LPT liability, valuations are divided into twenty (20) &lsquo;valuation bands&rsquo; that incrementally increase by &euro;50,000 per band. The only exceptions in this regard are Band 1 (&euro;0 to &euro;100,000) and Band 20 (greater than &euro;1m). The LPT liability for Bands 1 to 19 is calculated at 0.18% of the mid-point in each band. For example, properties valued in Band 1 pay &euro;90 per year (0.18% of &euro;50,000). The LPT liability on properties valued in Band 20 is calculated at 0.18% up to &euro;1m and 0.25% on the portion above &euro;1m. With effect from 2015, Local Authorities can vary the LPT base rate (rate applied in 2014) by plus or minus 15% on residential properties located in their specific area. This variation is referred to as the 'Local Adjustment Factor'. <\/p><p>The person who is the liable owner of a residential property on the &lsquo;liability date&rsquo; must make all statutory returns and payments in respect of that year. The &lsquo;liability date&rsquo; in respect of 2013 was 1 May 2013 and for all subsequent years is 1 November in the preceding year. For example, the liability date in respect of 2018 is 1 November 2017. The statutory payment date for LPT is 1 January in the due year (i.e. 1 January 2018 for 2018). However to ease the payment burden Revenue introduced a wide range of options that facilitate payment in full on the due date, on a phased basis over the course of the year, or by annual debit authority on 21 March in the due year. The phased payment arrangements can operate through direct debits from current bank accounts, through salary deductions, or through deductions from certain Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine payments.<\/p><p>The LPT Act provides for a number of exemptions from the tax where certain qualifying criteria are met. Properties qualifying for some of the exemptions are not liable to LPT for the full &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (currently 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019) while others cease to be available once a change occurs in the status of the property and the qualifying conditions are no longer met. <\/p><p>The LPT Act also provides for a deferral or partial deferral (50%) of LPT where certain specified circumstances exist. These circumstances include &lsquo;Income Level&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hardship&rsquo;, &lsquo;Personal Insolvency&rsquo; and &lsquo;Personal Representative of a Deceased Person&rsquo;. Once granted, a deferral normally remains in place for the duration of the &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (currently 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019). However a deferral is not an exemption and the outstanding liability remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed. Interest is also charged on the deferred amount at a rate of 4% per annum. <\/p><p>In circumstances of non-compliance, Revenue has a number of sanctions available to secure payment. These include mandatory deduction from salary, occupational pension and certain Government payments; withholding of a refund of other tax as payment against LPT; surcharge on income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax returns; refusal of a tax clearance certificate; application of interest at the rate of 8% per annum;\u00a0referral to a sheriff or a solicitor for collection; \u00a0Attachment of a bank account or third party debt. Revenue always makes every effort to engage with the defaulting taxpayer in an attempt to agree a mutually acceptable payment arrangement before any debt collection sanctions are applied. <\/p><p>Revenue publishes detailed statistical information on LPT, including collection at Local Authority level, on\u00a0its website at:  <i><i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/statistics\/local-property-tax\/index.aspx.<\/i><\/i><\/p><p>I recently announced that a review of the LPT will be advanced by my Department during 2018.\u00a0 The review will look in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments. It will also include an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax (LPT). The review will be carried out by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government. The review will include a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.<\/p><p>The purpose of the review will be to inform me in relation to any actions I may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue. The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.<\/p><p>Distribution of LPT to local authorities is the responsibility of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. Local retention of LPT began in 2015 and is now established as an important source of funding for the local government sector, thereby reducing reliance on central funding. The Government decided that 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions. The remaining 20% of LPT is re-distributed to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the State. This reflects the fact that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources.<\/p><p>In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it, known as the baseline.\u00a0 There are variances across the country in terms of LPT levels but it is important that all local authorities receive at least this baseline level of funding to ensure they can deliver services. Equalisation is the process that ensures that every local authority&rsquo;s LPT allocation is brought up to this baseline and there is a finite level of funding available for this purpose. Funding for equalisation purposes is provided via the Local Government Fund.

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.<\/p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.<\/p><p>Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance<\/i>was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan. <\/p><p>These recommendations were formulated to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs, whilst taking account of the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  This stability aspect is important, as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation again where particular firms drive prices down to a level that is unsustainable and which ultimately results in insolvency.<\/p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The third such update was published on the Department's website on 23 October 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations. <\/p><p>32 actions were due for completion in the first three quarters of 2017 in total and 29 of those actions have been completed to date.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  The fourth quarterly update for 2017 is scheduled to be published within the next few weeks and will focus on the 14 actions which were due for completion in the final quarter of 2017. <\/p><p>I believe that the ongoing implementation of the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, <\/i>in addition to the implementation of the Working Group's forthcoming report on employer and public liability insurance, will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12 or so months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.<\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for December 2017) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 16.3% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300068#WRE04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Card Interest Rates","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300068#WRE04900"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[2856\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300068#WRE05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of interest paid by consumers on credit cards in each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not captured by the Central Bank as part of\u00a0 the Credit and Debit Card Statistics they publish on a quarterly basis.<\/p><p>These statistics provide data in relation to credit and debit card transactions, including a sectoral breakdown of expenditure, E-commerce, spending outside Ireland, and data pertaining to the role of debit cards.

Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions.  All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. <\/p>  <p>  The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended in 2014.  The additional levy of 0.15% which my predecessor introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, also ended in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate. <\/p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.\u00a0  It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.  In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme.  The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will benefit from the changes which my predecessor began in Budget 2015 and which have continued in subsequent Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300069#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300069#WRF03400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exchequer Returns","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300069#WRF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[3212\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300069#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount of unspent moneys received back into the Exchequer from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in each of the years 2015 to 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Those public servants who have retired from 1 March 2012 (post-February 2012 retirees) will benefit from the pay increases awarded under the PSSA in nearly all cases.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Public servants who retired before 1 March 2012 (pre-March 2012 retirees) will benefit from the pay increases under the PSSA only where the current equivalent salary (paid to serving staff) is above, or moves above, the salary on which that pension is based.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the\u00a0Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides for the significant further lessening of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), occurring by way of threshold and rate changes to apply on 1 January\u00a02019 and 1 January 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This scheduled further lessening of the PSPR impact on pensions will mean that from 1 January 2019 all pensions up to &euro;39,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 12,000 pensioners from the impact of PSPR.<\/p>  <p>  From 1 January 2020, further PSPR-amelioration will mean that all pensions up to &euro;54,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 10,500 additional pensioners from the impact of PSPR.<\/p>  <p>  When fully in place from the beginning of 2020, these changes will mean that the vast majority of public service retirees - approximately 97% - comprising everyone with occupational pension values up to at least &euro;54,000, will be entirely free of PSPR.

Furthermore, the OGP does not have a practice of seeking security for costs in public procurement matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300070#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300070#WRG01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300070#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[3184\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300070#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a school (details supplied) has been waiting for an engineer to inspect the proposed new site for the purpose of building a new school for over three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>A building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is included in my Department&rsquo;s current 6 year construction programme.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department have been working with Galway County Council under the Memorandum of Understanding for the acquisition of school sites in order to identify and procure a suitable site for the school.\u00a0 A number of potential site options have been identified and these are currently under consideration.\u00a0 <\/p><p>While\u00a0the site acquisition process is underway, given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally I am not in a position to comment further at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300070#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Applications","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300070#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[2774\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300070#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an application for a transfer of school by a person (details supplied) will be decided upon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.<\/p><p>Currently over 115,000 children, including almost 12,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, children are eligible for school transport where they are attending the nearest recognised: mainstream school, special class\/special school or a unit, that is or can be resourced, to meet their special educational needs.<\/p><p>Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENO).<\/p><p>The child in question was eligible for school transport.<\/p><p>Under the terms of the Scheme\u00a0services may be withdrawn and\/or replaced with an alternative service\/grant where circumstances change.

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; and provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the South Kildare school planning areas is being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated data.  It is anticipated that decisions based on the nationwide demographic exercises will be announced shortly.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process which has been in place since 2011.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model and medium of instruction.  Therefore, where, based on demographics, it might be indicated that a new school is required, it cannot be guaranteed that this would be a school under a particular type of patronage as this will be dependent to a large degree on parental preferences in the area at the time of a patronage process.<\/p>  <p>  The patronage process has been in place since 2011 and is a fair, transparent and open process and it is open to all patrons to apply.

The next step will be for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring forward a Memorandum for Government on the formal ratification process which will happen in the coming weeks.  The Attorney General has advised that a D&aacute;il resolution will be required in the context of a charge upon public funds arising from the ratification of the convention.  This will be a welcome opportunity for debate in the House on the position of people with disabilities in our society and the importance of this convention. <\/p>  <p>  The Government also approved the publication of draft legislation relating to deprivation of liberty for public consultation.  The draft legislative provisions outline proposed safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and certain categories of people with mental health issues to ensure that they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in residential facilities. <\/p>  <p>  Deprivation of liberty is a sensitive and important matter which goes to the heart of fundamental freedoms and human rights.  Legislative proposals in this area will have significant implications for families, the operation of the health services and the courts.  It is important that people fully understand what is being proposed.  For this reason, Minister Harris and I are inviting submissions from stakeholders and the general public by way of public consultation up until March before these are finalised for drafting. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is making good progress with regard to making the Convention&rsquo;s requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate and timely manner.  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s full implementation of the Convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap. <\/p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform on the law of decision&ndash;making capacity.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are two further priority implementation issues: these are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making Capacity Act 2015 which requires the Decision Support Service to be operational and ready to roll out the new &ndash;decision making support options.  The 2018 Budget has provided an allocation of &euro;3 million for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am continuing to take a wide range of practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the &lsquo;Make Work Pay Group&rsquo; was published in April of last year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 saw positive action measures being taken to support public service recruitment of people with disabilities.  I also published the Disability Inclusion Strategy in July of last year containing a wide range of practical commitments to improve the lives of people with disabilities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300072#WRJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300072#WRJ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[2769\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300072#WRJ04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when personal superannuation fund statements for 2015 and 2016 as provided for under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 are required to be issued to prison officers recruited since 2012; when\u00a0they will\u00a0be issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the new Single Public Service Pension Scheme (\"Single Scheme\") commenced with effect from 1 January 2013.

Accordingly, the putting in place of the internal structures to service the Disclosures Tribunal referred to was a matter for the Commissioner without a direct role for the Minister.  I am advised that it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  On a general note I would reiterate that the Government has been anxious to ensure that the Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To that end the Government has sought to ensure that the required resources are at the disposal of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the Disclosure Tribunal Co-ordination Office is currently staffed by two fulltime members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one appointed by the former Garda Commissioner and one by the current Acting Commissioner.  There are also a number of additional personnel facilitating the work of the coordination office on an ad hoc basis as requirements dictate.  Liaison persons have been nominated from relevant sections\/regions to deal with specific requests from the Tribunal.  I am further advised that the Disclosures Tribunal Coordination Office will assist any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, serving and retired, irrespective of rank in relation to the Disclosures Tribunal. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Early last year the former Commissioner identified a need for the re-engagement of a small number of retired persons to meet the needs of the Tribunal and my Department approved this in February, subject to formal sanction, which was conveyed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 5 May.  The Tribunal commenced its work in February. <\/p>  <p>  The formal sanction provided for the engagement of three persons (i.e. two retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one civilian) for up to nine months for the purposes of servicing the Tribunal.  I am advised that the services of two retired senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (one retired Assistant Commissioner and one retired Chief Superintendent) were engaged initially for a period of six months and then for a further period of three months to 30 November 2017 in accordance with the formal sanction. I understand that both former officers concerned have now left their posts in compliance with the sanction.  There are no retired members currently employed with the Disclosure Tribunal Co-ordination Office. <\/p>  <p>  For completeness I would remind the Deputy that the Commissioner made a report to me under section 41(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 on 27 November last.  The report forwarded a document that detailed concerns in relation to the operation of the Tribunal Co-ordination Office. <\/p>  <p>  This matter is something I treat with the utmost seriousness and in that regard I instructed that the contents of the report be referred to the Tribunal.  That was done on 29 November last. The report was also referred to the Office of the Attorney General in order to seek advice in relation to the matters contained in the document and the appropriate course of action.<\/p>  <p>  I wrote to the Commissioner and requested a report under section 41(2) of the 2005 Garda Act 2005 addressing all of the issues raised in the document in so far as it relates to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Commissioner's responsibilities.  In late December, the Commissioner's interim response was forwarded to my Department.  This response does not articulate any concerns in relation to the establishment, staffing or operation of the Disclosures Tribunal Liaison Office.  I have however, sought further detail from the Commissioner to allow my Department to assess, independently, the material points contained in document in relation to matters within the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300072#WRJ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Properties","counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300072#WRJ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[2795\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300072#WRJ05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has received a formal request from a community based organisation (details supplied) regarding proposals to occupy and utilise a disused property for the purpose of delivering its programmes and services; if consideration will be given to such a venture; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":502,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.  <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that\u00a0it is not aware of a request from the organisation concerned for the use of the old courthouse building in Letterkenny.

Human trafficking and forced labour can exist in supply chains, in Ireland, or in the overseas supply chains of companies operating here.<\/p>  <p>  Human trafficking is an offence under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, which provides for up to life imprisonment and an unlimited fine. That legislation includes the offence of trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation. The Act defines trafficking broadly,\u00a0to include both\u00a0recruitment and the provision of employment in situations of exploitation.\u00a0The Act includes provisions in respect of extra-territorial jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to workplaces in Ireland, the Workplace Relations Commission is an independent, statutory body, responsible for the inspection of employment rights compliance and the provision of information to employees and the regulation and licensing of recruitment agencies. Inspectors notify an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where there is a concern in relation to human trafficking. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the deterrent\u00a0effect of the law, I\u00a0believe that consumer and investor demand are leading to greater awareness amongst companies of the need\u00a0for human rights compliance in their supply chains. This includes ensuring trafficked labour does not form part of the chain, whether in Ireland or overseas. The Government supports this work in a number of ways across different Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality, under the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland, keeps under review the adequacy of all measures aimed at the protection of individuals from labour exploitation. In formulating the Second National Action Plan, the Department engaged with trade unions and employers' representative bodies, and will continue to do so with a view to strengthening their preventative role against trafficking and forced labour. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department will also work with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation as lead Department, to enable ratification of Optional Protocol No. 29 to the Forced Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation. That Protocol further strengthens the international legal framework against forced labour, including by supporting due diligence by public and private sectors to prevent and respond to risks of forced or compulsory labour.<\/p>  <p>  There are a range of other initiatives supported by Government to address the root causes of trafficking and forced labour in supply chains.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's National Action\u00a0Plan on Corporate\u00a0Social Responsibility, which is being taken forward by the Department of Business,\u00a0Enterprise and Innovation, includes the promotion of guidance and best practice initiatives relating to sustainable supply chain policies.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's National Plan on Business and Human Rights 2017-2020, recently launched by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, aims to\u00a0give effect to the UN Guiding Principles\u00a0on Business and\u00a0Human Rights.

The Steering Group includes representatives from Pavee Point and the relevant Government Departments.<\/p><p>The NTRIS for instance includes a number of education-focused actions aimed at improving access, participation and outcomes for members of the Roma community. The aim is to achieve outcomes for Roma that are equal to those of the majority population. Actions include a commitment by the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and TUSLA to develop early intervention education welfare supports to promote and support Roma attendance, participation and engagement with the education system. Similarly, the Government is promoting the Early Childcare Education pre-school scheme to facilitate access for Roma children to free pre-school from the age of three until they start school. <\/p><p>My Department has begun work on an action to fund Traveller and Roma representative groups to implement community based supports to assist the retention of Roma children in the education system.<\/p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is developing targeted initiatives to increase Roma engagement with employment and training services. <\/p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE will support the implementation of the findings of this Roma Needs Assessment. Also, acknowledging the results of the National Roma Needs Assessment for Roma in Ireland, the HSE will support Roma women to access maternal health services in a timely manner.<\/p><p>The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017 - 2021 may be accessed on my Department's website or by clicking on this link: <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300075#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300075#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[3465\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300075#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the citizenship status of a person involved in a scenario (details supplied).","asker":"1284","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":628,"content":"<p>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.\u00a0 Section 7 of the Act, which\u00a0governs Irish citizenship by descent, provides that, with some limited exceptions, a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen.\u00a0 This, however, does not\u00a0include the circumstances as outlined by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also appreciate that this is a highly complex area.\u00a0 As the Deputy\u00a0may be\u00a0aware, Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted reproduction.

Under our scheme, credits are paid to all insurers for their older and sicker members - these credits are funded directly by a levy on all health insurance contracts written. The scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional cost of insuring older and sicker members. By sharing the cost of insurance this way, we can ensure that older people are treated fairly.<\/p>  <p>  From 1 April 2018, the levy on advanced policies (which represents 90% of the market) will be &euro;444 for an adult, unchanged from last year.

The current average premium paid is &euro;1,188 (as of 30 June 2017).<\/p>  <p>  The price of each premium is a commercial decision by health insurers, who decide how much they wish to charge for the level of coverage in each health insurance contract, taking account of a range of factors in addition to the amount of levy payable.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; <\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.<\/p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  <\/p><p>I have met with both Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss this issue in detail.  In order to improve the transparency of these additional charges, I outlined that a schedule of charges should be provided to potential residents on enquiry to an individual nursing home, rather than at the point of admission.  Nursing Homes Ireland undertook to advise their members to do so.  I have also recently met with  the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Office of the Ombudsman and HIQA  to discuss this matter further.<\/p><p>I have asked the Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to also consider this matter and examine the options that might be available, as part of its ongoing work. As part of this work, Officials  from the Department of Health and the HSE are to preform  an examination of the issue of additional charges in nursing homes. They will report their findings and recommendations to the Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group for consideration.<\/p><p>In the past week I have met with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)  who are undertaking a project to develop guidelines for the contracts between nursing homes and their residents. I fully support the CCPC in this work and I have already asked my Department to engage with the CCPC as required to assist with its work. In that regard, officials have already met with the CCPC project team to assist with its enquiries.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's reference to prescription charges, I can confirm that from the 1st January 2018 the prescription charge for all medical card holders is &euro;2, with a monthly cap of &euro;20. The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to reduce the cost of medicines for Irish citizens and further reductions in the prescription charge may be considered in the future, having regard to the funding available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300077#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":766,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300077#WRO03600"},{"type":"question","counter":767,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[2886\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300077#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to extend the fair deal scheme to home care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":768,"content":"<p>Improving home care services so that people can continue to live with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes for as long as possible is a key commitment of the Government.  However, the only statutory scheme in place at present to support older people is the Nursing Home Support Scheme. The Government intends to address this by establishing a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services. It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way. The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.<\/p>  <p>  As an initial step in this process, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home care systems in four other European countries. This review, which was published in April 2017, will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.  I, along with Minister Daly, also launched a public consultation process in July 2017 which closed in October 2017.  The purpose of this consultation was to allow all those with views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  There was a very high response rate to the consultation process with approximately 2,600 submissions received.  It is intended to publish a report of the findings of the consultation process in the coming months.  Further consultation with stakeholders, including service users, will take place later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a complex undertaking which will involve significant legislative, operational and financial resources. A considerable amount of detailed work remains to be undertaken before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.

This report related to hormonal pregnancy testing preparations in general, and did not mention any specific product. In April 1975, the NDAB issued a warning letter to practitioners regarding the use of hormonal pregnancy testing preparations. This letter reminded practitioners that these preparations had not been assessed by the NDAB, and that their use as a means of pregnancy testing had not been accepted by the NDAB. The letter also highlighted that these preparations should be avoided, as a firm statement of safety could not be given and other, more efficient methods of pregnancy testing were available. <\/p>  <p>  Between 1976 and 1980, the NDAB received five reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of HPTs.

The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 sets out that a worker making a protected disclosure will receive appropriate protections and cannot be penalised as a result of having reported relevant wrongdoings under the Act.<\/p><p>Section 5 of the 2014 Act provides protection for workers who disclose information in relation to the following wrongdoings:<\/p><p>a) The commission of an offence;<\/p><p>b) The failure of a person to comply with any legal obligation, other than one arising under the worker's contract of employment or other contract whereby the worker undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services;<\/p><p>c) A miscarriage of justice;<\/p><p>d) A danger to the health and safety of any individual;<\/p><p>e) Damage to the environment;<\/p><p>f) An unlawful or otherwise improper use of funds or resources of a public body, or of other public money;<\/p><p>g) An act or omission by or on behalf of a public body that is oppressive, discriminatory or grossly negligent or constitutes gross mismanagement; or<\/p><p>h) Information tending to show any matter falling within any of the preceding paragraphs (a) to (g) has been, is being, or is likely to be concealed or destroyed.<\/p><p>A worker must make a disclosure in the manner set out in the Act to be entitled to the protections of the Act. Different standards apply depending on the person or body to whom the worker makes the disclosure. <\/p><p>There is an onus on employers in public bodies under my aegis to assess any disclosure made, to conduct an investigation where warranted and to address all findings of that investigation that require attention.  In doing so they must keep the identity of the individual confidential insofar as is possible and of course the person must not be penalised by their employer for reporting relevant wrongdoings.  All public bodies, including the HSE have developed policies and procedures for dealing with protected disclosures.<\/p><p>If employers fail to protect the worker or if worker is penalised  for making a protected disclosure, Part 3 of the Act sets out the protections and potential redress available.  The Department of Public Expenditure's guidance notes that Procedures should include a commitment that penalisation of workers who make a disclosure will not be tolerated and workers who feel that they are being subjected to adverse treatment should report the matter immediately to management.  The Procedures should further contain a commitment to assess \/ investigate such notifications and to take appropriate action (which may include disciplinary action against supervisors and co-workers) where necessary.  The HSE includes this advice to its workers on its website.  If a complaint is made by a person to the HSE of penalisation contrary to the 2014 Act, then that complaint will be dealt with, having regard to the continued obligation to protect the identity of the discloser under the Act.<\/p><p>In addition, if an employee feels that the employer has penalised him\/her for making a protected disclosure, the employee may refer the matter to an Adjudicator of the Workplace Relations Commission.  Generally speaking such action by the employer would encompass any action which could be interpreted as penalisation by the employer against the employee for having made a protected disclosure.<\/p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission has published a Code of Practice on Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The Code notes that p  enalisation is defined in the Act and includes, for example, suspension\/layoff\/dismissal,  demotion, transfer of duties, imposition of reprimand discipline or other penalty, unfair treatment, discrimination and harassment threat or reprisal.  An Adjudicator will hear the case and issue a decision. A decision could declare that the complaint was not well founded, or if declared well founded, it could require the employer to take a specified course of action, including payment of compensation.  The decision of an Adjudicator may be appealed to the Labour Court.<\/p><p>This Code is accessible at the following website: <i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300079#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300079#WRQ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":865,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[2989\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300079#WRQ02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when capital funding will be allocated for the new endoscopy unit, oncology unit, physical medicine unit, physical therapy unit and day procedure department at Naas General Hospital;

This new approach will provide significant benefits for the service users, the public and the health system including: <\/p><p>- making the services easier to understand;<\/p><p>- streamlining the application processes resulting in only one application and decision being required for home support services for older people; and <\/p><p>- facilitating service users to move to changed levels of services as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.<\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people (home help and home hours combined), an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  <\/p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow.  It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home care across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  Home care is monitored on an on-going basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs and within the overall available resources for home care and having regard to demand throughout the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":943,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR04500"},{"type":"question","counter":944,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[3263\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the funding proposal for a new endoscopy unit at Naas General Hospital has been considered under the capital plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":945,"content":"<p>Health capital funding was outlined in the recently published Public Service Estimates for 2018 and the HSE is currently developing its Capital Plan for 2018-2021. <\/p><p>The Government is preparing a new National Development Plan for the period 2018-2027, which is expected to be published alongside and in support of the forthcoming new National Planning Framework, to sustain national economic and social progress over the long term.<\/p><p>My Department has also referred your question to the Health Service Executive and requested the HSE to reply directly to you in relation to capital developments at Naas Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":946,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR04800"},{"type":"question","counter":947,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[3265\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the HSE's policy in relation to the operation of car parks within hospital grounds; the amount of revenue collected in respect of those car parks nationally, by hospital; his views on the charges persons must pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":948,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Data","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR05100"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[3277\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children on a waiting list for scoliosis surgery at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin in January 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":951,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Funding","counter":952,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR05400"},{"type":"question","counter":953,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[3278\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300080#WRR05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if as part of the 2018 capital plan the HSE has made funding available for a project (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":954,"content":"<p>The Mid Term review of the Capital Plan was published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 13 September 2017.

This is further reflected within the National Strategic Outcomes contained with the draft National Planning Framework, including &lsquo;Transition to a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Society,&rsquo; which I expect to be fully reflected in the final National Planning Framework which is due to be published shortly. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that under the National Planning Framework, each Regional Assembly will be tasked with preparing a Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES).  The principal purpose of each RSES is to support the implementation of the National Planning Framework by providing a long-term strategic planning and economic framework for the development of the regions. Each RSES will be required to be consistent with the National Policy Objectives of the National Planning Framework and assist in the delivery of its National Strategic Outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I understand that the preparation of each of the RSES will be subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which requires each plan to take full account of relevant EU and national legislative requirements, including in relation to climate change, in accordance with the SEA legislation. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Adaptation Framework, which I launched on 19 January, sets out the context to ensure local authorities, regions and key sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making.  The role of spatial planning through the National Planning Framework will be critical in ensuring a successful outcome for implementing the National Adaptation Framework. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside the National Adaptation Framework, I also announced a funding commitment from my Department of &euro;10 million over 5 years to establish\u00a0four Local Authority Regional Climate Action Offices.

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that\u00a0the\u00a0new scheme\u00a0delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines set the framework and\u00a0extent of\u00a0financial support options for national renewable electricity\u00a0(RES-E)\u00a0support schemes. In general and except for small scale and demonstration projects, RES-E support levels must be set through competitive bidding processes (renewable\u00a0electricity auctions)\u00a0and all new RES-E schemes should provide support in the form of a premium in addition to the market price. <\/p>  <p>  Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment.  The appraisal clearly indicated that the costs associated with supporting micro generation of renewable electricity are greater, relative to larger and medium scale renewable electricity projects. In addition, the analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed.  These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account.  This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states\u00a0who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could\u00a0have an important role\u00a0in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon\u00a0economy,\u00a0in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and in increasing social acceptance of renewable energy projects right across the country. In October 2017 my Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation which discussed a number of these challenges with relevant stakeholders. A number of potential options to incentivise a greater uptake of micro generation in Ireland were identified and my Department will work with all relevant stakeholders over the coming months to further develop these options.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the emerging principles of the proposed RESS\u00a0closed on 10 November. Over 1,250 submissions were received, which are being reviewed\u00a0and will inform the final design of the RESS.  Following on from this, a final proposal will be brought to Government for approval\u00a0early this year, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision,\u00a0a formal application\u00a0for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300084#WRV03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":1158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300084#WRV03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1159,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[3284\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300084#WRV03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the work, findings and reports of the recently established household waste collection price monitoring group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1160,"content":"<p>I established the Price Monitoring Group to track monthly pricing development in the Waste Collection Market as flat fees are phased out in line with the Government's decision in June 2017.<\/p><p>The Group has so far considered four months of pricing data trends.

Any replacement of the requirement for the display of discs on vehicle windscreens would need to be considered in the context of the level of application of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) by An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, in order to ensure that adequate enforcement levels are maintained.<\/p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the abolition of the motor tax disc took effect in the U.K. from 1 October 2014.  In that jurisdiction, a vehicle excise duty evasion survey is carried out on a bi-annual basis.  The results of the survey carried out in 2015, the first following the abolition of the disc, found that the rate of unlicensed vehicles observed on the road was much higher than had been observed in the previous survey in 2013, prior to the abolition of the disc.  The survey concluded that the increase was probably due to the changes in the vehicle licensing system which took effect from October 2014, which included the abolition of the disc.  The 2017 survey, published on 16 November 2017, found that the rate of unlicensed vehicles observed on the road had increased since the 2015 survey. <\/p>  <p>   The Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, T.D., in his former role as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, published a Report on the cost of motor insurance in January 2017.  The Group considered the issue of the abolition of the paper-based insurance disc as part of its deliberations.  The decision of the Working Group was that it was not recommending the phasing out of the paper-based insurance disc.  In arriving at its conclusion, the Group noted the experience in the U.K. following the removal of the paper motor tax disc and, in terms of enforcement, set out that Ireland is not yet in a position to underpin an enforcement regime where technology would be the primary method of enforcement.  In relation to the use of ANPR, the Group recommended that the phasing out of the paper insurance disc should be reviewed in the future as the development of technology progresses.  The continued use of the paper motor tax disc will also be kept under review in that context. <\/p>  <p>   The replacement of motor tax with increased fuel charges is also not being considered at the current time.  In order to maintain the tax base currently realised from motor tax, an increase in fuel duty in the order of some 30c per litre would be required, with direct negative impacts on the rate of inflation and economic competitiveness.  As indicated in the Question, goods vehicles and other high usage and high mileage vehicles, such as public service vehicles and buses, would have higher costs under a pay-as-you-drive system.  There would be other distributional effects, including on those with longer distances to commute.<\/p>  <p>  A significant increase in fuel duty would lead to an increase in cross-Border fuel purchasing, further depressing the tax base and requiring a compensatory adjustment to make up the shortfall.  The potential for an increase in fuel laundering is also clear in this regard.  Any benefits to replacing motor tax with fuel duty would have to be weighed against these issues, and others, before any such change could be contemplated.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the environmental issues raised in the Question, motor tax for pre-2008 cars is based on engine size.  The basis of charging from 2008 onwards is on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  The public consultation process on the proposed changes, in December 2006, made it clear from the outset that the objective of the new motor tax system was to influence the future purchasing decisions of consumers in favour of lower carbon emitting vehicles.  European Environment Agency (EEA) statistics show that the average emissions of new cars in Ireland in 2001 was 166.6 grams per kilometre (g\/km), reducing to 161.6g\/km in 2007, just prior to the introduction of the new system.  The average emissions of new cars entering the fleet in 2015 was 114g\/km, ahead of the EU target of 130g\/km set out in EU Regulation No. 443 of 2009 which sets performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community&rsquo;s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light duty vehicles.  It is, therefore, clear that the measure has been successful from an environmental perspective in reducing emissions from CO2.  The issue of emissions from diesel cars will be considered in the context of the Clean Air Strategy being developed by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Mr. Denis Naughten, T.D.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of payment periods, motor tax is payable on an annual, half-yearly or quarterly basis.  The rates applicable for the half-yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge, respectively.  These relativities have remained generally consistent since the 1960s.  <\/p>  <p>  The differential takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of my Department (which operates the online motor tax system) in processing non-annual renewals, as well as the resultant administrative and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.  Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process.

The average cost of childcare in Ireland rose by &euro;7 per week, which is well below the &euro;20 per week on offer through the universal subsidy and significantly lower than the targeted subventions available, which amount to up to &euro;145 per child, per week, up to age 15.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I understand that any rise in childcare fees is a very significant matter for any family.

I will continue to seek more investment to assist parents by offering subsidies such as those above and I am working very hard on this.

I have commissioned an Independent Review of the Cost of Delivery of Quality Childcare; which is underway and will examine what the real cost of delivering childcare is so that Government can be better informed of what appropriate fees are and the level of funding that is required to subsidise fees for parents.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime I will continue to work to deliver quality, accessible, affordable childcare for all families in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300087#WRY04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"After-School Support Services","counter":1346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300087#WRY04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1347,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[2829\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300087#WRY04900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to provide supports for children who have a disability to attend after-school clubs and avail of the community childcare subvention programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1348,"content":"<p>I believe it is important to break-down barriers and create equal opportunities for children with disabilities to take part in the mainstream education right from the start.\u00a0 This has to begin in early childhood.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An example of such a policy programme that has the capacity to enhance the lives of children with disabilities is the AIM programme which was developed by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with a disability can access the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Its goal is to support early years providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience. AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs and strengths of the child and the early years setting. Supports provided under AIM include: the development of an inclusive culture; enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; the provision of equipment, appliances and grants for minor alterations; access to therapeutic intervention and increased capitation for early years providers in the case of children with very complex needs. AIM was launched in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  AIM is designed to support children to access the ECCE programme. The child must qualify on age grounds for the ECCE programme and the early years provider must be registered with Tusla and hold an active DCYA contract to deliver the ECCE programme. The only exception to this is where the child qualifies for the ECCE programme but is availing of early childhood care and education services funded under another DCYA childcare programme such as the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) or Training and Education Childcare (TEC) programmes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In its first year, AIM provided 2,486 children with 4,760 targeted supports to ensure that they could fully participate in the ECCE programme. In the current programme year, AIM has provided 3,071 children with 4,474 targeted supports to date. <\/p>  <p>  At the moment, there are no plans to extend AIM supports beyond the ECCE programme to cater for children in after-school care or the CCS Programme. However, I wish to note that the benefits of AIM are extending beyond pre-school children to these and other cohorts. AIM universal supports are benefitting all children in early years settings through for example, improvements in inclusive practice within these settings and improvements in knowledge and\u00a0competence among the staff in relation to disability.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An End of Year One Review of AIM is underway and will be completed in mid-2018. This will be followed by a full and more in-depth end of year three evaluation of AIM in 2019. These reviews will examine what has worked well and identify where improvements could be made to the Model. They will also help to inform consideration of possible future AIM expansion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300087#WRY05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Services Programme","counter":1349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300087#WRY05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1350,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[2914\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300087#WRY05200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of community services resource centre programme applications received; when it is expected a decision will be made; the decision making process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1351,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[2915\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300087#WRY05300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of applications received from Galway city and county in relation to the community services resource centre programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1352,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 547 and 548 together.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, administers the Family Resource Centre Programme.

At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.\u00a0 For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two.  Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six.  The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland.  Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities. If children are not in school by six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.  (Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education.  Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.) <\/p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, my Department has worked to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development.  The two main enhancements are:- <\/p>  <p>  - ECCE entitlement currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018.  This is in keeping with good international practice.<\/p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities.  Over 5,000 children have so far benefited from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.<\/p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme.  On 6th December 2017, I announced that I paused a decision on the removal of the Upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018\/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In summary, from September 2018, all children, including children with disabilities will be able to access a full two years of ECCE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300088#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1361,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[3043\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300088#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when a person (details supplied) attending a preschool under the ECCE scheme will have a special needs assistant appointed for them through the better start access and inclusion model; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1362,"content":"<p>The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) supports children with a disability to access and fully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.

They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, childcare providers and parents. There are now 30 CCCs, as Limerick City and Limerick County CCCs have amalgamated, as have Waterford City and Waterford County and North and South Tipperary. Each committee has a distinct legal identity and board of directors. City and County Childcare Committees receive funding from my Department for the operations of the Committee, allowing each one to employ staff and implement actions contained in its strategic plan, which is approved by my Department to reflect national policy objectives. Pobal acts as managing agent on behalf of the Department in relation to the performance of individual CCCs. Pobal appraises and monitors the local planning and implementation of activities and outcomes of each CCC associated with my Department's funding, and supports CCCs individually and collectively.<\/p><p>The CCCs support the delivery of the childcare programmes operated by my Department: the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Programme. CCCs perform a range of activities to promote the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) including providing information and support for parents and ECCE settings. They are also responsible for rolling out the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training programme to pre-school practitioners nationwide. They provide support and guidance to local service providers and parents in relation to the childcare programmes and support quality in keeping with national frameworks and policy objectives. CCCs are also available to co-ordinate and provide training to providers and offer support to families with regard to Early Years services within their respective catchment areas.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the table.  This table outlines the core funding allocated annually to each CCC from 2008 to 2018. To note that my Department also provides additional annual funding to the CCCs to support a number of initiatives including the administration of the Childminding Development Grant, the Access and

These supports include work programmes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s.<\/p><p>Schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment.  <\/p><p>In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as T&uacute;s.  <\/p><p>Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented from July 2017.  As part of the changes introduced, the qualifying age was reduced to 21 years.  In addition while, in general, all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major  award, their time can be extended by up to 2 years to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects.  This allows for 3 years continuous participation on CE.  Those over 55 years of age can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way that CE operates and should allow access to more people who are long-term unemployed.  <\/p><p>Currently, participants can remain on T&uacute;s for one year and I have no plans to change this.<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>However, changes will be implemented in the coming weeks to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the numbers available for this scheme.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register  in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. <\/p><p>I will continue to keep this whole area under review so that these schemes provide real and valuable support to both individuals and communities. The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.

Carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) is a primary income support and its means test is one of the least onerous in the suite of social protection supports provided by my Department.  The means test for Carer's Allowance involves assessing income and if a person is single, &euro;332.50 of their gross weekly income is not taken into account.  If they are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting the first &euro;665 of their combined gross weekly income is disregarded.  PRSI, union dues, superannuation (pension contributions) and travel expenses are also deducted.  For a couple, the combined gross weekly balance is then halved to give the carer's weekly means.  Any payment made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) is not taken into account in the means test for Carer's Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The level of payment for Family Income Supplement (FIS) is determined on a completely different basis as a percentage of the difference between the household income and annual family income limits which are increased in line with the size of the family.  It would not therefore be appropriate to apply alternative thresholds to a specific action.  More generally, any improvements or additions to the income limits for carers allowance could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable improvements have been introduced for carers in recent years.  In Budget 2016, the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant, which is payable without a means test, was increased to &euro;1,700 in addition to other measures benefiting carers including extending the period when the allowance can be paid following the death of a care recipient from 6 to 12 weeks.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   <\/p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18 October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.

Like its predecessor, the plan will  have a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach that aims to improve outcomes for  the vulnerable and marginalised in our society, while recognising a shared responsibility across Government to implement actions to achieve the overall objectives.  The theme of the new plan is one of active inclusion, which will enable every citizen, notably the most disadvantaged, to fully participate in society, including having a job.<\/p>  <p>  The primary focus will be the reduction of consistent poverty through a three pronged approach: supporting incomes through as high as possible a level of employment, and encouraging and assisting people to enter the workforce; setting targets for the level of relevant welfare payments (as in the original NAP inclusion) designed to reduce relative poverty among those who cannot (or cannot find) work; and finally improving access to quality services such as health, education, childcare, training, housing, community supports in order to minimise deprivation for all groups and, in particular those who are on relatively low incomes such as one parent families.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of NAP inclusion is the national social target for poverty reduction (NSTPR), which sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition for reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty.  The headline target is to reduce consistent poverty   to 2 per cent or less by 2020 (with an interim target of 4 per cent by 2016), from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3 per cent.  In addition, there are sub-targets in relation to children and for Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target.  Meeting these targets &ndash; or indeed making significant progress towards them &ndash; by the 2020 deadline will be a challenge and one that will require the combined efforts of all Government Departments, boosted by the resources and commitment of civil society.

Following the report of the expert group published in April 2003, a circular was issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the expert report.<\/p><p>In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established industrial relations processes. In this regard, the matter of increasing the retirement age for firefighters was included as part of recent discussions on a wide range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, between the Local Government Management Agency, representing the employers, and SIPTU.<\/p><p>I understand that these discussions are at a preliminary stage and therefore I am unable to give an indication as to when these discussions will be completed or the likely outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300093#WREE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Licence Applications","counter":1681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300093#WREE03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1682,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[3298\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300093#WREE03400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there have been applications for a foreshore licence from a company (details supplied) to allow for an exploratory rig on the Kish Bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1683,"content":"<p>Providence Resources surrendered a licence to allow for an exploratory rig on the Kish Bank on 12 February 2013.\u00a0 My Department has not received a\u00a0subsequent application in respect of exploratory works on the Kish Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300093#WREE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Applications","counter":1684,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300093#WREE03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1685,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[3326\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018012300093#WREE03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if an appeal lodged by Longford County Council in respect of a person (details supplied) will be allowed.","asker":"1250","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1686,"content":"<p>The detailed administration of the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability, including the assessment, approval and payment of individual grants to applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The framework for the operation of the scheme is laid down in statutory regulations, namely the Housing (Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability) (Amendment) Regulations, 2014.\u00a0  Under these regulations,\u00a0applications for grant aid\u00a0are assessed by a local authority on the basis of household income and\u00a0the maximum grant of &euro;30,000\u00a0is available to applicants whose gross household income is less than &euro;30,000 per annum, tapering to 30% for applicants with gross household incomes of between &euro;50,001 and &euro;60,000 per annum.
