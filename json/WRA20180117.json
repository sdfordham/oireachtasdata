In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible. Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.     The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  <\/p>  <p>  Other factors that influence appeals times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decision&rsquo;s process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the appeals office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff has led to a slightly longer time to conclude appeals in 2017.  However, I am advised by the Chief Appeals Officer that she expects performance to improve further in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of claims. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[2049\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the job placement types that will be encompassed under the youth employment support scheme proposed in Budget 2018.","asker":"1232","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[2050\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when the youth employment support scheme will be introduced; and the specific skill benefits it will provide.","asker":"1232","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 33 together.<\/p><p>The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) is a new scheme that I intend to introduce in May\/June of this year.<\/p><p>The scheme will be targeted at young people aged 18 to 24 who are long-term unemployed or who face barriers to employment &ndash; people who even in the Celtic Tiger years would have found it difficult to get a foot on the career ladder. <\/p><p>The aim is to provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.

Both an effective income support system and health services are key to addressing these difficulties but the research has also demonstrated that work can be an important factor in recovery, in particular for people with mental health issues. The Make Work Pay report for People with Disabilities, published last year, identified the need for flexibility in the income support and medical card system where a person with a disability takes up a job and options available if that job does not work out.  This anxiety can be particularly pronounced amongst those with mental health issues, given the episodic nature of such conditions.  One of the recommendations of the report was to put in place and promote a system for fast-track reinstatement of disability allowance, illness benefit or invalidity pension to people with disabilities who have returned to work, and have subsequently had to leave their job within one year.<\/p>  <p>  As a first step in implementing this recommendation a fast-track return to disability allowance protocol has now been put in place.

These include the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the EmployAbility service and employment support grants for people with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, my Department was a partner organisation in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Service project, which ran between 2015 and 2017.  The aim of this project was to demonstrate how existing mental health and supported employment (EmployAbility) services could fulfil the best practice Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment for clients with mental health issues.  An evaluation report is currently being finalised and this shows that overall, the project demonstrated good outcomes through improved integration between mental health services and employment support services.  Following on from this work, my Department has been collaborating with the Department of Health and the Health Services Executive to consider how best to embed this learning within the social protection and the health systems. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[1881\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will review the rules for calculating means for social welfare payments regarding compensation paid for damage carried out to the principal private residence of a person, by CPOs or a State agency when the person has to invest the money back into their residence to mitigate the damage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>Social welfare legislation provides for the disregard of certain compensation awards when assessing the means of a person for social assistance schemes.

Perhaps the most fundamental reform measure contained within this plan will relate to the development of a new automatic enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.  Auto enrolment would see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.

Fraud and error surveys are an integral part of the Department&rsquo;s overall approach to control.

In recent years, the C&amp;AG has made recommendations in relation to the methodologies underpinning the surveys which have been adopted by the Department and the implementation of actions to address control weaknesses identified as a result of surveys.

First, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Second, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, and is funded via the PRSI system.  The third main state pension available to some people over 66 is the Widows\/Widowers Contributory Pension.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to ensure those qualifying for the contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Such contributory pensions, with rates of payment linked to contributions made into a fund, are the norm internationally.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that people can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for the means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  When all payments across the State pension system are taken into account, the difference in the average direct payment to men and women is approximately 1% in Ireland.  This would be very low by European standards, and as a result CSO figures show that poverty levels among those over 66 are very low for both men and women, and are at parity.  In the latest figures, the rate of Consistent Poverty for men over 66 was 1.79% for men and 1.36% for women, compared to 8.3% for the general population.<\/p>  <p>  Later this year, I plan to propose legislation to introduce a total contributions approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory), replacing the current yearly average approach.  The position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, last year I instructed my Department officials to undertake an in-depth examination of 2012 changes to the rate bands of the State Pension (contributory), with a view to identifying equitable options for reliefs where a person's PRSI gap resulted from a period of caring for children or older people, or for those with homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme in 1994.  I am pleased to say, that this work has been completed.  Later this week I will bring this report to a Cabinet Committee for discussion, with a view to bringing a proposal to Cabinet in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700068#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Reform","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[2062\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to examine the pension anomaly which exists in which persons aged 65 years of age are being put on jobseeker's payments at retirement; her further plans for when the pension age increases to 67 years of age in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[1877\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of plans to reinstate the State transition pension to prevent persons forced to retire at 65 years of age having to apply for jobseeker's payments for one year until they reach the State pensionable age of 66 years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 37 together.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to reinstate the State Pension Transition. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age. Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.<\/p>  <p>  We are all well aware that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[2026\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the measures she has taken to address the above average unemployment levels which persist in County Wexford; her plans to increase the number of activation case officers in County Wexford; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>The official measure of unemployment is sourced from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).  The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.2% by mid-2017.  Numbers at work have increased from just over 1.83 million in Quarter 2, 2012 to 2.06 million in Quarter 2, 2017 &ndash; an increase of 227,000 persons.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from 19.0% to 8.1% over the same period, and numbers in employment have increased by 29,000 to 214,900. While data from the QNHS are not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment. Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in the 5 years to December 2017, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to December 2017, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1,707 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with the national trend.   The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:  <\/p>  <p>-    Firstly, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the region in the last two years. <\/p>  <p>-    Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.<\/p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford and I am confident that they will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are 11 Activation Case Officers in Wexford.  This is an increase of one in comparison to January 2017, when there were 10.  Prior to the roll-out of Intreo, there were 8 Activation Case Officers in Wexford, including former FAS personnel and DSP Jobs Facilitators.<\/p>  <p>  The Case Officer capacity is supplemented by referrals to Turas Nua under the Job Path programme and to Wexford Local Development which operates the Local Employment Service (LES) on behalf of the Department.  Wexford Local Development is contracted to provide intensive supports to 960 customers and employs 8 mediators to support LES operations. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 9,114 customer engagements were scheduled by Activation Case Officers in 2017 in addition to their work with employers.  Local records indicate that approximately 5,300 referrals to Turas Nua took place over the course of the year. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is required to operate within a staff ceiling figure and the focus remains on ensuring that the best use is made of all available resources.  Against that background, and a falling Live Register, there are currently no plans to increase the number of Activation Case Officers. However, the matter is kept under constant review in light of changing circumstances. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payments","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[1847\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason for the directive given from her Department that the circumstances surrounding the need for an exceptional needs payment must be unforeseen as well as exceptional; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[1988\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the level and amount of exceptional needs payments that have been made in County Tipperary over the past four years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[2373\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for exceptional needs payments in each of the past three years and to date in 2018; the number approved, refused or pending respectively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[2385\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which funding for exceptional needs payments became exhausted in her Department before the end of 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 38, 217 and 229 together.  <\/p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  <\/p><p>An urgent needs payment (UNP) is a once-off payment made to persons who may not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time.

This was an ambitious target, particularly during a time of economic recession, but one to which the Government has remained committed.Data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) indicate that consistent poverty rose sharply after 2010, to a peak of 9.1% in 2013.  The latest SILC 2016 data, released by the CSO in December 2017, indicate that this had reduced to 8.3%.  A reduction of 6 percentage points would now be required to meet the 2020 poverty target.    The impact of the recovery is not yet fully reflected in these most recent data, which reflect income conditions in 2015-2016.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6.1% towards the end of 2017.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2018 introduced increases in a range of supports including &euro;5 per week increases in the maximum weekly rate for working-age people and young jobseekers and for pensioners, with proportionate increases for adult dependents and an increase of &euro;2 per child per week for qualified child dependents.

The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are very favourable in comparison with their level of contribution over their working lives.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension.  Where they have limited additional means, they may instead be paid a non-contributory pension of up to 95% the maximum contributory rate, and over 70% of such pensioners are paid that pension at that rate.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.<\/p>  <p>  I committed to examine in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a cabinet committee later this week.  Following that meeting, and subject to any necessary amendment or further discussions, I will bring the report to Government for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory).  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.  This will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  <\/p>  <p>  A discussion paper is being drafted by my Department and it is hoped to start the consultation process with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach. <\/p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[2033\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700069#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if extra staff are required to facilitate a more rapid process of appeals having particular regard to the hardship and stress caused by delays which appear to affect the system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>The average appeal processing times for all appeals determined from 2015 to 2017 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the tables.

My Department&rsquo;s priority in supporting CE is to ensure access to good quality work experience and training qualifications on schemes for jobseekers and other vulnerable groups in order to support their progression into employment.  In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as T&uacute;s.  Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented from July 2017.  The qualifying age was reduced to 21 years.  In addition, while in general all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major  award, their time can be extended by up to 2 year to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects.     This allows for 3 years continuous participation on CE. Those over 55 years of age can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way the schemes operate and will allow more people who are long-term unemployed to access them.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.

However, she is hopeful that processing times will improve as a number of newly appointed Officers gain experience in their roles.<\/p><p>Specific actions taken to reduce processing times include: liaising with HR to ensure that vacancies are filled quickly; ensuring that training is given to new Appeals Officers as early as possible; working with the Department to reduce time in submitting appeal files. <\/p><p>It is open to an appellant to claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal if their means are insufficient to meet their needs. <\/p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that processing times are a priority.  However, the drive for efficiency must be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent and of high quality. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeals Processing Times by Scheme 01\/01\/2015 &ndash;

To recap, the review of the Capital Plan highlighted some key themes which will closely inform and be incorporated into the analysis leading to the finalisation of the new ten-year plan for public capital\u00a0investment 2018-2027.\u00a0 These themes include:- <\/p>  <p>  -  confirmation of the central role of public capital investment in underpinning the economy's long-term growth potential and addressing overheating risks as well as supporting social progress;<\/p>  <p>  -  the need to align public capital investment priorities to a changing demographic profile;<\/p>  <p>  -  the critical importance of public capital infrastructure in meeting the essential requirement for balanced regional growth and promoting the\u00a0societal transformation required to achieve climate action objectives;<\/p>  <p>  -  the\u00a0mechanisms through\u00a0which public investment can\u00a0strengthen\u00a0the economy&rsquo;s resilience to major risks such as Brexit; <\/p>  <p>  -  the central importance of robust mechanisms to\u00a0support the efficiency\u00a0and value for money of\u00a0public capital investment; and <\/p>  <p>  -  the strong business case for ensuring that public capital spending is balanced between new projects and maintaining the quality and capacity of\u00a0existing public capital infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the analysis, the review of the capital plan identified a number of key sectors as priorities for investment, including transport, education, housing and health.\u00a0 The findings of the review assisted Government in selecting priorities for the allocation of the additional\u00a0&euro;4.3 billion\u00a0capital expenditure allocated in Budget 2018\u00a0over the period to 2021.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Consequently,\u00a0between 2014 and 2021, public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out\u00a0by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to\u00a0among the highest in the EU.\u00a0\u00a0Capital expenditure is projected to\u00a0reach\u00a0&euro;8.4 billion in 2021 which is equivalent to\u00a03.8% of GNI*. <\/p>  <p>  The new ten-year capital plan is currently being\u00a0finalised.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  <\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are: <\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.  <\/p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.  <\/p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.  <\/p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.  <\/p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  <\/p><p>I have met with both Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss this issue in detail.  In order to improve the transparency of these additional charges, I outlined that a schedule of charges should be provided to potential residents on enquiry to an individual nursing home, rather than at the point of admission.  Nursing Homes Ireland undertook to advise their members to do so.  I have also recently met with  the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Office of the Ombudsman and HIQA  to discuss this matter further.<\/p><p>I have asked the Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to also consider this matter and examine the options that might be available, as part of its ongoing work.  <\/p><p>A small group of representatives from the Department of Health and the HSE are to preform  an examination of the issue of additional charges in nursing homes.  They will report their findings and recommendations to the Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group.  <\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that our older population are protected, that they get the care that they deserve, and that they have access to all of the information they need in order to be able to make an informed decision, especially at such a vulnerable stage in their lives.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700078#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Building Programme","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700079#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[2175\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700079#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the proposed new community hospital will be built in Killarney, County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1320","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700079#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700079#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[2176\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700079#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for surgery at University Hospital Galway; and the expected timeframe in view of the fact that this person has been on the waiting list since June 2016.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) publishes an annual report on Air Quality in Europe with estimates on health impacts.  The latest report, covering the year 2014, was published in October last year and is available to download at the following link:\u00a0 <\/p><p>The report indicates that for 2014, there were approximately 1,510 premature deaths in Ireland that could be attributed to air pollution, and over 18,000 years of life lost.  While this EEA report does not calculate a cost for this health impact, a 2015 World Health Organisation report (&quot;Economic cost of the health impact of air pollution in Europe&quot;) estimated a cost to Ireland of over US$2.5 billion for the year 2010.  Further information on the impact of air pollution across Europe is available from a Commission impact assessment (available\u00a0at )\u00a0which indicates 121,378,612 lost working days across Europe arising from particulate matter pollution. <\/p><p>While the health statistics do not disaggregate the impact according to the source of pollution, we know that transport is an important contributor of pollutants, including PM2.5 and especially NOx.  In relation to pollution along the M50, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is currently undertaking indicative particulate monitoring and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) monitoring at two locations adjacent to the M50.  The first monitoring station is located\u00a0by the eastern quadrant of the N4\/M50 interchange. The second monitoring station is located to the western quadrant of the Sandyford interchange. Monitoring commenced at both stations in February 2014.  Both stations were established to monitor trends in emissions of PM10 and NO2 in the vicinity of the upgraded M50 Motorway as per modification 3(2) of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision to approve the scheme. <\/p><p>The measured concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 at both monitoring stations are significantly below the limits set out within the Air Quality Standards Regulations (S.I. 180 of 2011).  At the monitoring station established in the western quadrant of the Sandyford interchange, the measured NO2 concentrations are below the limits set out within the Air Quality Standards Regulations.  At the monitoring station in the eastern quadrant of the N4\/M50 interchange, six separate locations have been monitored.  At five of these locations, the measured NO2 concentrations are below the limits set out within the Air Quality Standards Regulations.  However, the annual average limit value has been exceeded at one roadside NO2 monitoring location.<\/p><p>In light of the health concerns arising from air pollution, my Department is working on the first ever National Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.  The Clean Air Strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including vehicle emissions, in an integrated manner.  I intend to launch the Strategy in the coming months.<\/p><p>I am also supporting the development and rollout of a new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The AAMP will double the number of ambient air quality monitoring stations in Ireland by 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.<\/p><p>In relation to noise, it should be noted that\u00a0Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin County Councils operate a County Dublin Environmental Noise Information website which can be accessed at .  A number of monitors are situated close to the M50.<\/p><p>Motorways, including the M50, fall within the scope of EU Directive 2002\/49\/EC (the Environmental Noise Directive, or END), relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise.  This Directive aims to provide &ldquo;a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise&rdquo;.  A key source of noise covered under the END is road traffic noise.<\/p><p>The Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 transpose the END into Irish law.  The Regulations designate noise-mapping bodies and action planning authorities for the production of strategic noise maps and action plans. Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to local authorities.  A number of other bodies also have noise mapping functions which are carried out on behalf of the local authorities concerned.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII - formerly the NRA &ndash; National Roads Authority) is a designated noise mapping body under the 2006 regulations.<\/p><p>The regulations also designate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the national authority for the purposes of the regulations.  The Agency's role includes supervisory, advisory and coordination functions in relation to both noise mapping and action planning, as well as the reporting requirements for the purpose of the Directive.<\/p><p>The regulations set out a process for addressing environmental noise.  Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps every 5 years for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, e.g. large urban areas (referred to as agglomerations), major roads, railways and airports.  The third round noise mapping process is almost complete and joined up maps for the four authorities in the Dublin agglomeration should be available in the coming weeks.  These maps will present modelled noise levels within the Dublin agglomeration including along the M50.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A period of public consultation will be organised to make these noise maps available at relevant Local Authorities and other mapping bodies.  Existing noise maps for the\u00a0first and\u00a0second round of the END are currently available on the EPA website and Local Authority websites. <\/p><p>Following on from the\u00a0third round mapping process, Action Planning Authorities (including relevant Local Authorities) are required to prepare Noise Action Plans to address noise levels identified through the mapping process.  The action plans are designed to act as a means of managing environmental noise by controlling future noise by planned measures, such as land-use planning, systems engineering for traffic, traffic planning, abatement by sound-insulation measures, and control of noise sources through measures such as noise barriers or low noise road surfaces.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the END does not set limit or target values, nor does it prescribe the measures to be included in the action plans,\u00a0which are\u00a0matters for the national authority in each Member State.  The EPA has previously produced guidance for Local Authorities on the content of such plans (at )<\/p><p>I would encourage members of the public to participate in this consultation process and engage with the relevant mapping bodies regarding areas where elevated noise levels are being experienced, and assist in identifying mitigations measures (such as road barriers) that could be included in Noise Action Plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700088#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme Review","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700089#WRW00500"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[2285\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700089#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his key priorities in regard to the forthcoming capital review; the projects submitted for priority inclusion in the review; the status of negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s policy commitments and investment priorities across key areas of national strategic importance are central to the delivery of many of the Strategic Outcomes detailed in the\u00a0National Planning Framework: Ireland 2040 Our Plan.\u00a0 My Department will oversee a significant programme of capital investment during the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027, which is currently being\u00a0finalised.

The purpose of the project is to address current capacity limits at peak hours on the Luas Green Line and to cater for future demands along the line. The project will cost approximately &euro;90 million and is proposed in the National Transport Authority's (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035.  It includes the lengthening of the existing green line tram fleet, the purchase of additional trams to meet future passenger demand and modifications to Sandyford Depot to stable and maintain these trams. A complementary investment project to lengthen the platforms at the Green Line stations was completed last year. <\/p>  <p>  The capacity increases at peak periods provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the Green Line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods. The NTA have advised that the first of the new 55 metre long trams is expected to be deployed in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of new park and ride facilities in Dublin, I wish to advise the Deputy that future provision is being made under a number of programmes. The recently announced 4 Year Capital Plan provides for investment of over &euro;770 million to progress the BusConnects programme to address growing congestion in the Dublin region in the short to medium term, including the provision of bus based Park and Ride facilities. BusConnects was launched last summer by the National Transport Authority (NTA) and work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is completed the proposals will be launched for public consultation in the first half of this year.  The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign, Core Bus Corridors and park and ride facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The NTAs Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area also includes the planned development of a network of strategic rail-based park and ride facilities where rail services intersect with the national road network. It is proposed that these facilities would be located at Swords, Finglas, Dunboyne, Liffey Valley, Naas Road, Carrickmines, Woodbrook and Greystones.  The Strategy indicates that further development of local park and ride facilities will also be considered at appropriate locations on the rail network in the outer parts of the Dublin metropolitan network and hinterland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan published in 2015 provides for investment of over &euro;700 million to progress new Metro North. Based on the outcome of the recent Fingal\/North Dublin Transport Study, the National Transport Authority has recommended that a revised metro project be selected as the appropriate public transport project to address the transport needs of the Swords\/Airport\/City-Centre Corridor. This Metro line will run from Dublin&rsquo;s south city centre via Dublin Airport and terminating at Estuary that will be served by a strategic Park &amp;amp; Ride. Arising from an option analysis and selection study of possible metro alignments and station locations, a final route and station location will be established, after which a public consultation process will be undertaken on the Emerging Preferred Route in early 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700092#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme Review","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700093#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[2298\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700093#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his key priorities in the forthcoming capital review; the projects submitted for priority inclusion in the review; the status of negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has proposed that a ten year capital plan will be set out which will take account of the National Planning Framework.

A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve approach (MACC) was used to compare &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; economic activity to &lsquo;low carbon&rsquo; options. The MACC tool was developed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). An estimated marginal cost per tonne of carbon abated was attributed to certain mitigation measures.  This technique allows for comparative analysis of &lsquo;low carbon&rsquo; alternatives across the key sectors in the NMP.  An overview of costs and emission reduction potential of sector specific mitigation measures can be found in the NMP <i><i>(<\/i><\/i><i><font color=\"#0000FF\">).<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>The Strategic Research and Analysis Division within my own Department employed the MACC tool to help model the economic and environmental impact of reducing speed limits on motorways from 120km\/h to 110km\/h for cars\/vans and from 90km\/h to 80km\/h for heavy duty vehicles.  They estimated that such a measure would be associated with a marginal cost of &euro;573 per tonne of carbon abated. Reducing speed limits lessens energy use; it is estimated that this measure could potentially reduce CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions by about 1.9Mt CO<sub>2<\/sub>between 2017 and 2030. The introduction of this measure would require extensive consideration of economic impact, traffic flows, implications of traffic transfer on to secondary networks, enforcement requirements, and potential modifications to the design of existing motorway infrastructure.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the cost per tonne of carbon abated through measures that encourage modal shift to either public transport or active travel modes is not currently available in the format sought.  Limitations in ascertaining robust baseline data and selecting representative modal shift scenarios hinder meaningful analysis; however, further work on modelling scenarios will continue over the lifetime of the NMP, and in the future it may be possible to do similar technical modelling work on these options.<\/p><p>In the meantime, modal shift towards public and sustainable transport continues to be usefully measured using other tools such as the National Travel Survey and the Canal Cordon Report.  Findings from these sources show that in Dublin alone, over 67% of all journeys in to the city centre are now made through sustainable means (walking, cycling, public transport) - a dramatic increase from 59% of journeys in 2010; while cycling and walking have grown greatly in popularity increasing by over 16% and nearly 9% respectively between 2014 and 2016.  Nationally public transport accounts for 5.5% of all journeys taken, with the number of passengers using public transport increasing to 251 million in 2017 - a 7% increase since 2016.

Of these, some 29.49 million households (17.3% of the total) were jobless - that is, no adult in the household was working.<\/p><p>For Ireland, the total number of relevant households was 1,440,600, and of these some 253,000 (17.6% of the total) were jobless.<\/p><p>Although the figure for Ireland has fallen from a high of 23% in 2012 as a result of the economic recovery, government remains concerned about aspects of household joblessness that go beyond the standard measures of unemployment and receipt of jobseeker's payments.  Relevant groups, not normally considered to be unemployed, include economically inactive lone parents, people with disabilities, and the adult dependants of unemployed people, all of whom might benefit from closer attachment to employment and the labour market.  A range of policy reforms has been taken affecting these groups, and further reforms were considered in consultation with representative bodies for those involved.  These policy developments are set out in the <i>Pathways to Work Action Plan for Jobless Households<\/i>which I published on 25, September 2017.  Development of the Action Plan fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the overall <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020<\/i>strategy.  It also responds to concerns about the level of household joblessness raised in Country-Specific Recommendations to Ireland by the EU. <\/p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobless Households<\/i>is an example of one of the many measures that Government is implementing, with a view to assisting people and families to become work ready and gain employment.  The Plan aims to extend activation services to people who are not working, but are not defined as unemployed by traditional measures.  It focuses in particular on improving employment rates of households with children &ndash; both the traditional &lsquo;nuclear&rsquo; family and the lone parent family.  A number of key policy initiatives to achieve that goal are identified as follows:<\/p><p><b>- Extend active engagement<\/b>with the Intreo employment service to additional groups of economically inactive working age adults;<\/p><p><b>- Improve incentives and remove barriers<\/b>for people transitioning from welfare to employment; <\/p><p><b>- Pilot a family focused case management approach<\/b>in five geographical areas to improve employment rates and reduce joblessness in households across Ireland.<\/p><p>Progress against each of the reform actions and milestones will be monitored and reported on quarterly to the Cabinet Committee on the Economy and Jobs.  Implementation of these policy measures should see the level of joblessness fall more rapidly than is already anticipated over the next few years.  These targets are in addition to the existing <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>targets 2020 &ndash; bringing unemployment down to between 5% and 6%, bringing long-term unemployment below 2.5%, and bringing youth unemployment below 12%.<\/p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobless Households<\/i>aims to identify and remove barriers that are currently preventing people from getting a fair chance, thus building a Republic of Opportunity for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700096#WRDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social

It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and are in receipt of long-term illness and disability payments. The payment of the living alone allowance is considered secondary, or non-primary, in nature which is incorporated into the person&rsquo;s qualifying payment.   The effect of the allowance is to increase the rate of payment to such people, recognizing that there are economies of scale associated with living with another person.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant costs would arise if the criteria were relaxed in the manner suggested by the Deputy, particularly as many existing domestic arrangements could fall within the definition of the living alone allowance criteria, as many adult children of older people live with them, and might become homeless if they had to leave the family home.  There would also, clearly, be significant administrative challenges in determining whether such co-residents of pensioners would in fact become homeless if they could not reside in their current address.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the living alone allowance my Department makes a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash on a weekly, monthly or less frequent basis. These payments are considered secondary, or non-primary, in nature.  In addition to the living alone increase a person may also be eligible for household benefits (worth &euro;580 per year), fuel allowance (worth &euro;607 per year) or supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme such as rent supplement. These secondary payments are in some cases are subject to a means or household composition test, which are valuable supports for recipients.<\/p>  <p>  The adult child of a householder moving back into the family home might reduce such additional allowances previously held by the householder. However, the economies of scale from living together should mean that a weekly contribution by the person moving in would more than compensate for any such reduction in payments from my Department which are, as I said, to compensate for the greater costs associated with living alone. <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for the Department&rsquo;s supplementary schemes are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.

The Action Plan for Jobs supports continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper Pathways to Work 2016-2020. <\/p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment.  <\/p><p>For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 14.8% in September 2017.  Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 19.1%. <\/p><p>Latest available data shows that the long-term unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 3.1%  in Q2 2017.  The long-term unemployment rate for young people has fallen from over 15% at peak to below 5% in mid-2017.<\/p><p>Both the youth and long-term figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment. Additionally, Ireland is on course to bring youth unemployment below 12% and long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>targets for 2020.<\/p><p>Policy continues to focus on support for the long-term unemployed and young unemployed.  For example, the <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020<\/i>strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people &ndash; most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; through targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus; and through reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  <\/p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee process there is monthly engagement by case officers with unemployed young people to assist them to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes.<\/p><p>Later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment &ndash; people who even during the Celtic Tiger years would have found it difficult to get a foothold on the career ladder.

Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, via the PRSI system.  The third main state pension available to some people over 66 is the Widows\/Widowers Contributory Pension.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to ensure those qualifying for the contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Such contributory pensions, with rates of payment linked to contributions made into a fund, are the norm internationally.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that people can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the rateband changes introduced in 2012 did not impact upon a person&rsquo;s ability to qualify for a pension, as they introduced new rates of payment for reduced rate State pension (contributory) pensioners.  Nor did those changes impact upon a person&rsquo;s ability to qualify for a maximum rate contributory pension, as such pensioners would not have had enough contributions to qualify for a full rate pension before the changes were introduced under the previous ratebands introduced in 2000.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension. <\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for the means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  When all payments across the State pension system are taken into account, the difference in the average direct payment to men and women is approximately 1% in Ireland.  This would be very low by European standards, and as a result CSO figures show that poverty levels among those over 66 are very low for both men and women, and are at parity.  In the latest figures, the rate of Consistent Poverty for men over 66 was 1.79% for men and 1.36% for women, compared to 8.3% for the general population.<\/p>  <p>  Later this year, I plan to propose legislation to introduce a total contributions approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory), replacing the current yearly average approach.  The position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700098#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700098#WRFF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[2376\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700098#WRFF00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of restoring State pension levels to those applicable previously; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>The current rate bands applying to the State pension contributory were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still receive an 85% pension, whereas someone who paid into the system every week of those 50 years receives the 100% rate.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.<\/p>  <p>  I committed to examine in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a cabinet committee later this week.  Following that meeting, and subject to any necessary amendment or further discussions, I will then bring the report to Government for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory) from 2020, which would remove anomalies created by the current system in 1961.  It is hoped to start a consultation process regarding this reform with relevant stakeholders shortly.  Following this process, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach. <\/p>  <p>  This reform will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for people with a caring need.  <\/p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.

Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, via the PRSI system.  Thirdly, the Widows\/Widowers Contributory Pension is available to some people over 66.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for the means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  Therefore, the State pension system ensures that those of State pension age do have an adequate standard of living, with a safety net under the non-contributory pension of &euro;227 per week, plus additional payments such as Household Benefits, Fuel Allowance, and a Rent Allowance where required.  While there is a means-test, there are generous disallowances which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify for that pension at the maximum rate.  Therefore, people in receipt of reduced rate contributory pensions below the 98% rate would have significant additional means, over and above their State pension payment, as they would otherwise qualify for a non-contributory pension at a higher rate instead.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to ensure those qualifying for the contributory pension, which is funded by the Social Insurance Fund and is based upon contributions to that fund, have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Such contributory pensions, with rates of payment linked to contributions made into a fund, are the norm across the world, and underpin the PRSI system in this country.  To ensure that people can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.  Backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 is estimated to cost &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions.<\/p>  <p>  The State pension contributory rate bands introduced from September 2012 more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place before that.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are very favourable in comparison with their level of contribution.  For example, a person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still receive an 85% pension.  It is estimated that, to revert to the previous bands with effect from January 2018, would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.<\/p>  <p>  When all payments across the State pension system are taken into account, the difference in the average direct payment to men and women is approximately 1% in Ireland.  This would be very low by European standards, and as a result CSO figures show that poverty levels among those over 66 are very low for both men and women, and are at parity.  In the latest figures, the rate of Consistent Poverty for men over 66 was 1.79% for men and 1.36% for women, compared to 8.3% for the general population.<\/p>  <p>  I committed to examine in depth various options that may provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  Officials in my Department have completed a report on this matter, which I intend to bring to a cabinet committee later this week.  Following that meeting, and subject to any necessary amendment or further discussions, I will then bring the report to Government for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I expect to start a consultation process shortly with stakeholders on the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach to replace the yearly average approach to State Pension calculation.  Thereafter, a proposal to Government will be made. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700099#WRGG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":610,"content":"<p>Question No. 226 answered with Question No. 44.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700099#WRGG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[2383\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018011700099#WRGG00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if adequate staff are available throughout the various sectors of her Department to ensure the expeditious of applications.

To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level. <\/p>  <p>  This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories and by duration of unemployment.

Overall, the review found that the scheme offers effective support for people who are long-term unemployed and who are interested in self-employment as a route to entering the labour market.  The scheme plays a useful role in supporting the development of new enterprises.  <\/p>  <p>  Research demonstrated that the numbers returning from self-employment to the Live Register, after participating on the scheme, are low.  Based on the comparison of the BTWEA participants to a control group of similar jobseekers who did not choose the scheme as an option, the BTWEA participant was over twice as likely to remain off the Live Register six months after the payments on the scheme had ceased. This trend continues when examined following an 18 month period after the payments ceasing. <\/p>  <p>  One of the amendments following the review was the participants who take up self-employment are able to access the BTWEA after 9 months, down from 12 months.  This enables access to the supports to those wishing to commence self-employment at an earlier stage of their unemployment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is an educational opportunities scheme for persons in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments wishing to pursue second or third level courses of education in order to improve their employment prospects.

It may also be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons. <\/p>  <p>  Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2018 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;74.1 million on the farm assist scheme.    <\/p>  <p>  Farm Assist recipients will benefit from the following measures which I provided for in Budget 2018; the &euro;5 per week increase in the maximum weekly rates of payment, proportionate increases in weekly payments for qualified adults and a &euro;2 per week increase for each qualified child.

However, where the spouse\/partner of the farmer is in insurable employment, they may qualify for WFP\/FIS, subject to meeting the criteria outlined above.   <\/p>  <p>  Other support payments offered by my Department include the jobseeker's benefit (JB) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) schemes which provide income support for people who have lost work and who are available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.
