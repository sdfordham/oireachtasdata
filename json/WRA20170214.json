The matter has been discussed at the Early Years Forum which I chair, and in other fora with my Department.<\/p>  <p>  We are working with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a new Early Years workforce plan.  This will examine workforce supply issues.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware that pay and conditions of staff is a significant barrier to retaining staff in the sector.  Whilst my Department is not an employer of childcare workers, we are a significant funder.  I am committed to the development of high quality services in this country and it has been proven that high quality care is dependent on a workforce that feels valued.  My Department is working with the sector to explore how we can improve retention rates.  The Programme for Government contains 14 commitments to improving access to high quality, affordable childcare.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme I am introducing this year will provide an important infrastructure for future investment in the Early Years sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that we need to focus collaboratively on how best to make the early years sector as attractive and personally rewarding place in which to work.  I think that pay is only one issue, although, clearly an important one.  The fact that we are investing considerably increased resources in the sector will also be important.  In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, up by &euro;120m to &euro;466m.  This was on top of a 35% increase in Budget 2016 also.<\/p>  <p>  These increases reflect the emphasis I am placing on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  In this regard, the City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committees are assisting services who experience difficulties in recruiting or retaining staff, and the Learner Funds are in place to support staff in achieving minimum qualification requirements, both regulatory and contractual.<\/p>  <p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting.

In doing so, I was conscious that excluding housing costs is fairer for families with the same income but different housing choices. <\/p>  <p>  Allowing the deductibility of housing costs would, in effect, mean that the Affordable Childcare Scheme would part-subsidise families&rsquo; housing choices.  For example, we may consider two families that have the same income level, but one family has chosen to live in a larger or more expensive house.  If housing costs were deductible from the income-assessment for the Affordable Childcare Scheme, then the family that chose to live in a larger house would receive a larger childcare subsidy, and would do so solely because of how that family had chosen to spend its income.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme would thus provide additional financial support to families who choose larger or more expensive housing options.  If we were to allow for the deduction of housing costs, this allowance would generally benefit higher-income earners more, which would run counter to the intention of the Scheme to target supports primarily at those with the lowest incomes. <\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) is based on net parental income, and the highest levels of support will be offered to those on the lowest incomes.  ACS is fairer and more accessible than the current targeted childcare programmes, under which many low-income families are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain State benefits or attending certain training programmes.  ACS will also enhance affordability, offering greater levels of support overall to low income families than the current targeted childcare programmes.  For example, parents on the lowest incomes, who previously received a subsidy of &euro;95 per week, may now receive a subsidy of between &euro;150 and &euro;205 per week, depending on the age of the child.  The amount payable by a parent in such a case will &ndash; in an average childcare service &ndash; fall from &euro;72 per week at present to between &euro;0 and &euro;17 per week under ACS, again depending on the age of the child.<\/p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the financial burden of housing costs for many families with children, ACS aims to target subsidies on the basis of an equitable assessment of the total income coming into a family.  Housing costs are not considered.  As I have already outlined, this approach to assessing means is very much in line with most means-assessment Government schemes currently in operation.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this is the right way forward.

However this did find that some services had come to rely on Community Employment scheme workers, and I determined that these services should be provided additional funding to enable them to recruit and retain qualified staff to work alongside their CE scheme participants. <\/p>  <p>  As a result, I have made available up to &euro;2,000 for services to assist with the recruitment process or to provide expert support in HR management, with additional money being provided to each service after analysis of their individual financial situation, to ensure that they can fully meet the cost of these staff.

Maintaining contact during imprisonment has also been correlated with reduced recidivism rates by the parent. <\/p><p>Following a period of research, which included a detailed survey of existing visiting facilities and supports, the Families &amp;amp; Imprisonment Group (FIG) identified a number of essential pillars that should be in place to ensure that visits in Irish Prisons become a core element of rehabilitation and support for both the people in our care and their families.  The essential pillars identified by the FIG are as follows:<\/p><p>- Communications<\/p><p>- Physical Improvements<\/p><p>- Staff training<\/p><p>- Parenting courses and resettlement interventions; and<\/p><p>- Community Partnerships.<\/p><p>A pilot parenting programme entitled &lsquo;Parenting Plus&rsquo; was developed in partnership with Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) and delivered in Limerick prison in 2015 and 2016 as part of an overall &lsquo;Family Links&rsquo; Programme.  The programme aims are:<\/p><p>- To support small groups of prisoners to better understand their parenting role, and to develop practical skills which support them in positive parenting;<\/p><p>- To develop a parenting programme specifically for the prison population, which is effective and replicable;<\/p><p>- To support partners of prisoners to engage positively with their children and to offer families consistent language and approaches;<\/p><p>- To maximise opportunities for positive parent-child engagement within the limitation of a custodial setting; and<\/p><p>- To increase awareness of and responsibility for supporting, positive parenting as an important element of imprisonment and resettlement planning.<\/p><p>A number of significant objectives have been achieved so far; most notably enhanced staff training, delivery of the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme, the establishment of more family-friendly visits, and refurbishment of visit spaces. <\/p><p>In addition, Family Liaison Officer training has been provided by the IPS to enable participants to:<\/p><p>- Understand the role and function of a Family Liaison Officer;<\/p><p>- Understand the logic model process, and the rationale and evidence underpinning the Family Links programme;<\/p><p>- Have knowledge regarding community services and structures supporting and working with children and families;<\/p><p>- Have an understanding of the experience of being a parent in prison and the impact on family dynamics;<\/p><p>- Heightened empathy for, and ability to support, parents in prison.<\/p><p>An independent evaluation of the Family Links Programme in Limerick which was undertaken by the University of Limerick was launched by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday (13 February) in Dublin.<\/p><p>Finally, I note that children may be impacted by events affecting their parents, for instance parental ill health, mental health problems or parental absence, by way of the need to work away from home or by imprisonment. <\/p><p>Where this is the case, parents can seek assistance from family support services in their communities by direct referral or through a child welfare referral to Tusla.

Section 11 of the 1988 Act, which gives effect to Chapter 4 (Transfer of Personal Data to Third Countries) of the Directive, generally prohibits such transfers unless the third country concerned ensures an adequate level of data protection.

The importance of ongoing and continuous monitoring is, therefore, fully recognised and the European Commission is required to report to the Member States on any shortcomings or deficiencies that may emerge.

The report from the then Garda Commissioner was received in March 2011 and made it clear that there was no evidence that the individual in question was involved in any criminal activities here.  The report also outlined the position in respect of the basis on which co-operation from police services in other jurisdictions might be sought in special circumstances relating to the presence in this State of persons with a record of violence whose identities would be unknown to the Garda Authorities and who might seek to foment or shape violent protest here or to engage in other criminal activities in the State.

I understand that there is currently no agreed international or multilateral framework for such mutual recognition and no successful known precedent in place elsewhere between two or more jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  Since late 2013, the main identified obstacle to the project is the service of summonses on individuals residing in Northern Ireland in relation to road traffic offences which occurred in this jurisdiction.  Ensuring a summons can be served in another jurisdiction and accepted as properly effected when the case arrives at a court hearing is central to the success of the project.  <\/p>  <p>  The process for issuing summonses relating to unpaid Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs) for road traffic offences in this jurisdiction involves the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Fixed Charge Processing Office forwarding an electronic file of unpaid FCNs to the Courts Service in order that the Courts Service can generate these summonses.  As such, summonses relating to road traffic offences in this jurisdiction are not issued judicially but rather are generated by the Courts Service on an administrative basis in keeping with automated nature of the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS). <\/p>  <p>  A number of challenges have been identified, insofar as summons service for individuals residing outside this jurisdiction is concerned, with the result that such summons service is currently incompatible with the FCPS and its administrative relationship with the Courts Service.

As the Deputy knows, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the migration crisis that had developed on the southern shores of the European Union.  Under this decision a programme office was established in my Department to oversee the operational aspects of the programme, which aims to bring in 4,000 vulnerable migrants to Ireland under two different mechanisms, refugee resettlement - operated by the Office for Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) - and asylum seeker relocation.<\/p>  <p>  The IRPP deals with all aspects of a migrant's life from the moment they are selected for relocation or resettlement to their transportation to Ireland and eventual settlement in the communities around the state.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of persons are being accommodated in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) located in Mosney Accommodation Centre under the relocation strand of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).<\/p>  <p>  The services being provided to families include education, the services of a General Practitioner, HSE medical screening, and access to the services of the Department of Social Protection.  A core part of the job of the IRPP is coordination and ensuring appropriate service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The relevant services are provided locally or in some cases are provided at the centre.  The mode of service provision is determined on a case by case basis depending on the local situation and the individual circumstances of the asylum seekers.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made to mainstream services with local populations while not impacting on the delivery of local services.  Thus children in Mosney attend local schools and adults are provided with English language classes by the local ETB.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of English language supports comes under the remit of the Louth Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB).  It is important to note that when engaging with persons seeking English language supports, that in the first instance, all applicants once facilitated in the application process by trained front line LMETB staff, are then individually assessed, so as to identify the nature\/extent, if any of their current language levels in English.  This would encompass both written and spoken English.  Once levels have been established, a review is conducted to establish the cultural\/ethnic backgrounds from which applicants are coming.<\/p>  <p>  This information, alongside the established levels, enables the LMETB to place applicants in small but reasonably cohesive groups of similar level.  The Deputy may be aware and it is important to note that, alongside presenting with little or no English language proficiency, significant numbers of learners in this category also present with no\/little literacy capability in their mother tongue, thus the level of difficulty in tutoring is somewhat compounded by lack of awareness of basic alphabet in either mother tongue or English language.<\/p>  <p>  Based upon many years of experience working with this client group, LMETB management have established through analysis of data that the intensive English classes being provided are not on their own enough to build proficiency levels with any type of speed.  To address this, LMETB introduced a pilot scheme two years ago requiring all adults attending English language classes to also attend parallel conversational classes, and this has significantly improved the  language ability of adults attending ESOL programmes in centres.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the provision of English language classes in the Mosney centre is conducted in partnership with the management authorities of the centre and with whom LMETB meet regularly to plan for and discuss the nature and type of provision \/facilities to be provided on site in the Mosney centre.<\/p>  <p>  The timing of the arrivals played a huge part in the planning and delivery.  The first three groups were assessed and placed in classes within a week.  The classes were assigned two three hour sessions per week.  However, a group who arrived in to Mosney in November which translated into two class groups were assessed on 28 November.  It was agreed that they would do conversational English with the Mosney Support team up to Christmas and then commence their classes in January due to the fact that the term had only two weeks left before Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  A further group of 131 people (which translated into 8 class groups) arrived into Ireland on 16 December and were assessed by LMETB on 9 January.  Due to the large volume of learners and the timing (Christmas\/New Year period) it was not possible for the LMETB to recruit new tutors at such short notice.  Officials of the IRPP discussed this with the LMETB and it was agreed that in order to ensure that everyone got some level of English tuition, the classes would be offered three hours per week temporarily until new tutors were put in place.<\/p>  <p>  A group who arrived into Mosney in November, which was due to begin classes in January did not attend at all, despite a tutor being available to teach them.<\/p>  <p>  The LMETB offered to change the timetable to facilitate anyone who could not attend during the daytime.  One of the classes for the most recently arrived group is currently running on Wednesday evening.  LMETBs on-site coordinator of services has sent out written reminders, has contacted Mosney staff to assist and has now arranged with IRPP officials to have an interpreter to help facilitate a meeting with those who have not attended to ascertain why they have not attended.<\/p>  <p>  My officials have informed me that the LMETB is currently recruiting ESOL tutors both within and outside of the organisation to address the needs of both the Refugee and Asylum Seeker population within Mosney.  As well as providing similar supports to those within the community, the LMETB Adult Literacy Service (ALS) runs adult learning classes for both asylum seekers and refugees in the Education Centre in the Mosney Reception Centre.  The Adult Literacy Service liaises through the Mosney Inter-agency Committee with a number of agencies who support the residents of Mosney.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Refugee Resettlement Programme, ALS provides English language training and orientation training for incoming refugees while resident in Mosney.  LMETB ALS liaises specifically with the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and other local agencies to ensure that the transition process for those people who have fled war torn countries is managed smoothly and humanely.<\/p>  <p>  All of the learners are assessed and their levels are mapped to the QQI levels and the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for Languages.  CEFR is a guideline used to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across Europe.  Courses are offered at beginner A0 level to A2 QQI L3.<\/p>  <p>  An orientation programme is being run to accompany the language training programme and it covers a range of areas including essential Information that groups of families would need, Geography, Childcare and Safety, Children&rsquo;s Safety, Road Safety, Common Sign in Ireland, The Law in Ireland, Appropriate Dress, Food and Hygiene, Money Management and Services, Accommodation and Transport, Education and a module on moving towards independence.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the persons who are accommodated in the EROCs in both Monasterevin and Clonea Strand are programme refugees who arrive in Ireland with refugee status.  By contrast, the persons accommodated in the EROC located in Mosney (and Ballaghaderreen in the near future) are asylum seekers who are relocated from Greece under the two EU Council decisions dealing with relocation.  They therefore do not arrive in Ireland with refugee status but as asylum seekers whose claim for asylum has yet to be determined.  There are therefore some differences in the processes that must be gone through in relation to these two groups.  However, it is my view and that of the officials within the IRPP that there should be a broadly identical approach taken to language provision as between the two different groups and that is something we will be working towards, in conjunction with the relevant ETBs, over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to inform the Deputy that it is intended to start settling the earliest cohort of relocated persons currently in Mosney, a small number of whom arrived in Ireland in June, in the community in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400063#WRC04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Procedures","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400063#WRC04900"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[7187\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400063#WRC05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na passing information held on Garda databases to private investigator companies; the procedures and guidelines in place to deal with the issuing of licences to operate as a private investigator here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the management of information held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including that held on its databases, is an operational matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The section sets out a list of instances of harmful effect covered by this offence, which includes for example disclosures which result in the publication of personal information constituting an unwarranted and serious infringement of a person's right to privacy.  The penalty for such an offence, upon conviction on indictment, is a term of imprisonment for up to 5 years and\/or a maximum fine of &euro;50,000.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations provide that an unauthorised communication in relation to any information which comes to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's knowledge in the course of his or her duties constitutes a breach of discipline.  An &ldquo;unauthorised communication&rdquo; means any communication other that a communication made in the execution of his or her duties or authorised by the Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  It does not matter whether an unauthorised disclosure to a private investigator or anyone else, the provisions above will still apply.<\/p>  <p>  Any member of the public who believes that he or she has been the subject of unauthorised disclosure of information by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make a complaint to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has extensive powers of investigation.   <\/p>  <p>  The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended), is the statutory body with responsibility for the licensing and regulation of private investigators in the State.

The programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and exemplifies best practice. <\/p><p>Phase 1, which lasts 32 weeks, is based in the Garda College and places a strong emphasis on problem-based learning where students learn in small groups through engagement with realistic policing scenarios.  This methodology emphasises the development of &lsquo;learning to learn&rsquo; skills, the development of reflective practice and supports the transition into learning in an operational policing environment. <\/p><p>Phase 2, which lasts for 65 weeks, is primarily based in Garda stations with appropriate training and development structures in place that include access to a trained tutor Garda and a permanently appointed supervisory sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  During the course of their placement, trainees move through three development stages from assisting his or her Garda tutor to taking the lead role and being assisted by the tutor, to finally the autonomous stage where they are deployed in regular policing activity and work independently within the operational unit.  Over the course of the placement they also return to the Garda College for a number to weeks to further enhance their skills in specialist areas including sexual assault, intelligence &ndash;led policing, file preparation and court presentation and so on. <\/p><p>Phase 3 consists of seven weeks of preparation for final exams and assessments.<\/p><p>At the end of Phase 1 successful Garda trainees are attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers) and are dispersed to Garda stations throughout the country, where they are assigned to mainstream policing duties.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that training has been provided to tutor Garda&iacute; and supervisory Sergeants in the 63 designated stations outlined in the following table.

This is a policy\u00a0area that the Government will keep under active review in its\u00a0ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400064#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Debtors","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400064#WRD05900"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[6783\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400064#WRD06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 111 of 25 January 2017, the total amount written off in debt for each row in the table; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>My\u00a0reply to Question No. 111 of 25 January 2017 stated that 505 debtor connections with a par debt of &euro;27.3 billion had exited NAMA by end-2016.<\/p><p>I am advised that NAMA wrote off a total of &euro;956 million of par debt in respect of these 505 debtor connections, which is\u00a0less than 4% of the original par debt of &euro;27.248\u00a0billion acquired by NAMA relating to these\u00a0505 debtor connections. \u00a0Annual debt write-off amounts\u00a0are disclosed in NAMA's Annual Reports.<\/p><p>Debt is written off only in cases where all of a debtor's underlying assets have been realised and there is no further recourse available to NAMA to recover borrowings from the debtor - that is, when all avenues to recover borrowings have been exhausted.<\/p><p>It is important to note that not all debt includes personal guarantees or has personal recourse and that\u00a0recourse can be limited to the value of the assets which in many cases is lower than the outstanding amount borrowed.<\/p><p>The following table provides a breakdown of the 505 debtor connections that had exited NAMA by end-December 2016. \u00a0Debtor connections are banded by reference to the percentage of par debt repaid.

An individual in receipt of the SPCCC is entitled to a standard rate band of &euro;37,800.<\/p>  <p>  The income tax system started moving towards a system of individualisation in 1999, and individualisation is now integral to the overall system.

Prior to this, a second spouse faced the marginal rate of tax on the first euro (or Punt as it was then) earned in his or her own name.\u00a0 Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The Home Carer credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation of the tax system, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of tax individualisation was considered by the Commission on Taxation in 2009 and that body recommended no change should be made to the current system.

The remaining applications are being processed, and any unsuccessful applicants are advised about how to address any issues arising in their application.\u00a0 Details of the approved contractors are published on the Revenue website. I\u00a0am\u00a0advised by Revenue that they have seen a steady increase in the number of applications. \u00a0There were 9 applications for registration\u00a0received in late 2016, 89 in January and 40 in the first two weeks of February.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that\u00a0there is a significant volume of queries from contractors about the scheme, and about the information needed to register as a 'qualifying contractor'. \u00a0Revenue presented at an information session organised by the Construction Industry Federation in January which was very well attended, and are to present at two further information sessions in Cork and Galway soon.  The steady volume of applications and the level of interest in the scheme are apparent and I do not believe that there is a problem with the incentive.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I would also\u00a0point out that the scheme is still relatively new, and is due to run until the end of 2019.\u00a0 While there is strong interest in Help To Buy, it is too early to draw any firm conclusions from the data emerging at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding\u00a0retrospective claims, the legislation underpinning the Help To Buy incentive is set out in section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.\u00a0 The section distinguishes between refunds made in respect of contracts entered into in the period from 19 July to 31 December 2016 and those in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019.\u00a0 'Retrospective' first-time buyers are those persons who purchased in the period from when the incentive was announced on 19 July 2016 until the end of 2016 and the legislation provides that any such HTB refunds are paid directly to the claimant's bank account.\u00a0 HTB refunds for first time buyers of new homes in the period from 2017 onwards, are however, payable to\u00a0the qualifying contractor's bank account.\u00a0 I am advised by Revenue that 'retrospective' first-time buyers who claim their HTB refund should have that claim verified by their contractor.\u00a0 In the event that they cannot get their contractor to verify their claim, they should contact Revenue online via the 'MyEnquiries' facility.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the reasons why a contractor may not register for the scheme, I expect that would arise for non-compliant contractors who do not have valid tax clearance and would not be considered compliant for Relevant Contracts Tax purposes.\u00a0 The HTB scheme provides that the tax credit is payable at deposit stage and in many cases will be paid before the house is built.

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.<\/p>  <p>  The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.<\/p>  <p>  Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the Tourism Insight online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention.<\/p>  <p>  Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity.<\/p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.<\/p>  <p>  Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available.  While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4 million and in 2016 the total number of student for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4 m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.<\/p>  <p>  This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:<\/p>  <p>- Tourism\/Hotel\/Leisure\/Event<\/p>  <p>- Hospitality and Culinary<\/p>  <p>- Heritage and Cultural.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400066#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":351,"content":"<p>Summary

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.<\/p>  <p>  I am also mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including most importantly possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.<\/p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas.<\/p>  <p>  I initially allocated 4 weeks for receipt of submissions to the consultation, however, I received a number of representations from stakeholder groups who stand to potentially be impacted by any changes, coming from different sides of the debates involved, as well as from Oireachtas colleagues on different sides of the Houses urging that the time period for the consultation be extended.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been made aware of the impact of the mid-term break and the need to allow groups who depend on volunteers, such as the boards of management of schools, to have the time to consult their members and communities and submit responses which are properly considered and comprehensive. \u00a0I am anxious to facilitate the fullest possible engagement from all stakeholders and I recognise and appreciate the work and commitment of members of boards of management and I value their input in this consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, I have announced an extension of the time period for the receipt of written submissions in this consultation process by 4 weeks, meaning that the new deadline is Monday 20 March.  This means that the total time available for written submissions is 8 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  This phase of receiving written submissions is part of\u00a0the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps.  These steps will require additional time, and I am conscious of legislative deadlines impacting on this work, in particular the Equal Status (Admissions to Schools Bill) which is due before the House again shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400066#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Summer Works Scheme","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400066#WRF02650"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[6735\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400066#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"whether mechanical works will be short listed under the summer works scheme 2016-17 with regard to building works for the construction, extension and refurbishment of schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1320","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that nearly 50% of schools have applied for inclusion under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) which reflects a very high demand.

Some of this will undoubtedly be achieved through the lens of the new &lsquo;Creative Ireland&rsquo; initiative, being led by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and the Department of Education and Skills has significant commitments under what is called Pillar One of this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  From the more specific perspective of History, I am satisfied that there are a number of key supports to the study of 1916.  For one thing, many of the history-specific resources which have been developed for the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme retain a currency as we move further into the Decade of Centenaries.  The supports for teachers, and often generated by teachers, which are provided on the Department&rsquo;s education portal Scoilnet remain available to teachers and students.  So too, the fabulous resources available from the Bureau of Military History, the Letters of 1916 and other repositories, which were partners in the Department&rsquo;s work under Ireland 2016, will continue to be available to students, researchers and teachers as we close in on centenaries of other key years in the emergence of modern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Department will also continue its support for the all-island schools history competition, now in its fourth year and with a specific &lsquo;Decade of Centenaries&rsquo; focus.  We are also looking at appropriate ways of archiving the Proclamations for a New Generation, of which over a thousand were developed by schools during 2016.  These are a vivid reminder of the importance of learning from the past in order to reimagine and improve modern Ireland too.<\/p>  <p>  A full revision of the History specification is now underway at the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  It is expected that this review will produce a draft specification, for public comment, in the first half of 2017, and that both the events of 100 years ago, and the skills that students need to interpret and understand them, will form key elements of the eventual specification.  The new specification is scheduled for implementation in the autumn of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400066#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400066#WRF03950"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[6946\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400066#WRF04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to outline the extent to which he expects to be in a position to accede to the request for extra facilities including a much needed sports hall at a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>As\u00a0the Deputy is aware the school in question has submitted\u00a0an application to my Department, for significant capital funding for additional school accommodation.

Another will be filled through a transfer of a psychologist from another NEPS Region upon completion of her maternity leave.  The third vacancy will be fill from the new panel described above.

","asker":"1308","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":436,"content":"<p>Through comparing education internationally, it has been found that in high performing education systems such as New Zealand, Queensland, Estonia and Finland, schools have been given greater autonomy and flexibility in the programmes they offer. <\/p>  <p>  When schools in Ireland are implementing the new Framework for Junior Cycle, they too will have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.  I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle\u00a0is\u00a0ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle. <\/p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History.  History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.<\/p>  <p>  I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which\u00a0over 200 submissions were\u00a0received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts\u00a0about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.<\/p>  <p>  In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.\u00a0 Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them. <\/p>  <p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously. <\/p>  <p>  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those very skills, and attitudes, can indeed be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of\u00a0history, news and current affairs too. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400067#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400067#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[7124\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400067#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a decision will be made on an application by a school (details supplied) in view of the fact that the school will need to start construction to facilitate students for next year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my Department has received an application for additional accommodation from the school referred to by the Deputy.

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.<\/p>  <p>  I am also mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including most importantly possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.<\/p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. <\/p>  <p>  I initially allocated 4 weeks for receipt of submissions to the consultation, however, I received a number of representations from stakeholder groups who stand to potentially be impacted by any changes, coming from different sides of the debates involved, as well as from Oireachtas colleagues on different sides of the Houses urging that the time period for the consultation be extended.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been made aware of the impact of the mid-term break and the need to allow groups who depend on volunteers, such as the boards of management of schools, to have the time to consult their members and communities and submit responses which are properly considered and comprehensive. \u00a0I am anxious to facilitate the fullest possible engagement from all stakeholders and I recognise and appreciate the work and commitment of members of boards of management and I value their input in this consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, I have announced an extension of the time period for the receipt of written submissions in this consultation process by 4 weeks, meaning that the new deadline is Monday 20 March. This means that the total time available for written submissions is 8 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  This phase of receiving written submissions is part of\u00a0the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps. These steps will require additional time, and I am conscious of legislative deadlines impacting on this work, in particular the Equal Status (Admissions to Schools Bill) which is due before the House again shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400067#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400067#WRG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[7305\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400067#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress to date in the Government reaching its target of 400 non-denominational and multidenominational schools by 2030; the number of such schools to be opened in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016 on a pilot basis and my Department is currently working with local authorities to prepare for the wider national rollout of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. <\/p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.<\/p>  <p>  A scheme of this nature will require both significant capital and current exchequer investment expenditure over the next 5 years and therefore must be properly analysed and assessed to ensure the best use of public money.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is appropriately modelled from a financial perspective but also, and critically, that it is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives and delivers high quality social housing effectively.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency, who are assisting with implementation of the scheme, are in regular contact with the two pilot local authorities and I understand that the pilot is progressing well at a local level.  In parallel, my Department is working with local authorities to prepare for the rollout of the scheme.  This includes assisting with access to public sources of data relating to vacant property, as well as facilitating local cooperation between AHBs and LAs on how the scheme will operate on the ground for interested property owners.<\/p>  <p>  Several AHBs are working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas and, as the scheme becomes available nationally, I expect that more AHBs will become involved in the roll out of the scheme.  AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period.  While the current target for 2017 is 150 units, the interest expressed by property owners and stakeholders so far indicates that the 2017 targets will be achieved and could potentially be exceeded following national rollout.  Taking account of this, the capacity of local authorities and AHBs to deliver under the scheme, as well as the necessary agreement on the financial considerations arising, I am exploring how delivery under the new scheme might be accelerated.<\/p>  <p>  I would encourage any local authority that is eager to engage early with the scheme to liaise with the pilot local authorities and my Department, in order to be familiar with the requirements around participation and also the practical implementation issues that are being worked through with the pilot scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400068#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400068#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[6833\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400068#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of the operation of the buy and renew scheme in County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>The initiative to support the purchase and renewal of private houses for social housing use will be available in all local authority areas, including Tipperary during 2017.

Of these, 2,723 were ineligible or terminated during the process, 217 have been completed with 635 being actively progressed.  The reasons why a case has not progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.<\/p><p>Statistical information relating to the MTR scheme since its inception, including statistics on cases that have been terminated and the reasons for same, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at the following web link: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>A number of amendments were made to the MTR scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the amendments already made, the Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes.  A Review of the Mortgage to Rent Scheme was published on 8 February 2017 and represents the completion of an early action in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>.  The Review is available from the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:<i><\/i>.<\/p><p>The Review has explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommends a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  Key actions include:<\/p><p>- Lenders will be required to formally communicate with borrowers as to why they are not suitable for the scheme.<\/p><p>- The property price threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow is being increased to &euro;365,000 (from &euro;350,000) while the threshold for an apartment\/townhouse in these areas is being increased to &euro;310,000 (from &euro;300,000).  For the rest of the country, the threshold for a house is being increased to &euro;280,000 (from &euro;250,000) and for an apartment \/ townhouse to &euro;210,000 (&euro;190,000).<\/p><p>- Flexibility will be provided in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household will allow for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual needs of the household, with the property still being considered eligible.<\/p><p>- There are a number of actions to improve knowledge and understanding of the scheme.  A range of state agencies will be facilitated to assist and guide borrowers who could benefit from the scheme.  A Step by Step Guide for Borrowers will be produced alongside a range of other targeted information supports.<\/p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the actions put forward in the Review will make the MTR process quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgages distress.<\/p><p>In addition, the Review concludes that the current financial model of the scheme may not be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  Currently, the MTR scheme relies on AHBs to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.  A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.<\/p><p>One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.<\/p><p>A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400068#WRH07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400069#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[6965\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400069#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason a person on a social housing waiting list for five or six years, who moves a few miles to a different county to rent and apply for the HAP scheme, must reapply to go on the waiting list in the other county and go back to the bottom of the list; and if he will consider changing this policy (details supplied).","asker":"1232","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":548,"content":"<p>Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 set down a standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing support.

The Review is available from the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><i><\/i>.<\/p><p>The Review has explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommends a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers. <\/p><p>Key actions include:<\/p><p>- Lenders will be required to formally communicate with borrowers as to why they are not suitable for the scheme.<\/p><p>- The property price threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow is being increased to &euro;365,000 (from &euro;350,000) while the threshold for an apartment\/townhouse in these areas is being increased to &euro;310,000 (from &euro;300,000).  For the rest of the country, the threshold for a house is being increased to &euro;280,000 (from &euro;250,000) and for an apartment\/townhouse to &euro;210,000 (&euro;190,000).<\/p><p>- Flexibility will be provided in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household will allow for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual needs of the household, with the property still being considered eligible.<\/p><p>- There are a number of actions to improve knowledge and understanding of the scheme.  A range of state agencies will be facilitated to assist and guide borrowers who could benefit from the scheme.  A Step by Step Guide for Borrowers will be produced alongside a range of other targeted information supports. <\/p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the actions put forward in the Review will make the MTR process quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgages distress. <\/p><p>In addition, the Review concludes that the current financial model of the scheme may not be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  Currently, the MTR scheme relies on Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.  A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm's ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home. <\/p><p>One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.<\/p><p>A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400069#WRJ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Administration","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400069#WRJ04050"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[7422\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400069#WRJ04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"when the full completion of the transfer of commercial water rates to Irish Water will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services.

The final roll-out of HAP will be completed with the introduction of the scheme to Dublin City Council, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council areas from 1 March, 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) is also managing a HAP Homeless Pilot for the four Dublin local authorities.  The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015.  The focus of this pilot remains the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  To qualify for HAP under the homeless pilot scheme, a household must generally be accepted as homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 by one of the four Dublin local authorities.  The Homeless HAP support has also been used to prevent households from entering homelessness and homeless services.   <\/p>  <p>  While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, has also been established to engage directly with property-owners and support qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place.  This is a particularly important service for households currently residing in emergency accommodation in the Dublin region.  The costs of supporting these households and of the Dublin Place-Finder Service are funded through several funding streams across my Department, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council. <\/p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer moneys and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.  The provisional Exchequer outturn for the HAP scheme in 2016 was in excess of &euro;57 million.  This funding supported both the ongoing costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 additional households supported by the scheme nationally in 2016.  Some &euro;14 million of these costs related to tenancies established in the four Dublin local authority areas.  1,791 of these additional tenancies were established in the four Dublin local authority areas in 2016.  Budget 2017 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.

The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports continues to fall.  The full impact of the reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) and the positive impact of recent Budgets on lone parents are also not reflected in these figures. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 lone parents benefitted from a number of measures including increases in child benefit, changes to the means test on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment to align it with the more generous means test on the one-parent family payment, and increases in the family income supplement thresholds.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on OFP, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for OFP and JST have risen by &euro;20 from January this year, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  During that time the national minimum wage was increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.25 per hour.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%.  Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%.  Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.  This represents a cumulative increase across Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 almost &euro;27 per week for working lone parents and of over &euro;24 per week for lone parents who are not working.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.<\/p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting 102,000 children out of poverty.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Eurostat data shows that social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 34.9% to 16.9%, an absolute reduction of 18 percentage points.  In relative terms, this represents a poverty reduction effect of 52%.  Ireland continues to be consistently among the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers.  But we also know that, reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  It is also about supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas such as activation including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the OFP reforms the Department has begun engaging with lone parents whose youngest child is seven years and older, on a proactive and supported basis.  To date over 9,000 lone parents, of the 14,500 lone parents who are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, have been selected for engagement.  It will take time to see the full impact of these activation engagements as it will take time for lone parents to complete the education, training or employment support programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Initial indicative data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey also shows that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of lone parents in employment in the year since the end of June 2016.  This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally.  The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, however, is clearly significant.<\/p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the actions outlined above will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.  The independent review of the one-parent family payment reforms, once completed, will also assist with discussions in my Department on measures for lone parents in Budget 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Services Programme","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[6838\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a programme provider (details supplied) in County Donegal has been informed by Pobal that its previous funding levels, which had provided for 39 hours towards the cost of salaries for members of staff, will no longer be made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>The community services programme (CSP) provides financial support to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a social inclusion nature.

In 2015, incomes rose by 6.2% mainly due to rising employment, the deprivation rate fell for the second year running, and 13,000 children were lifted out of consistent poverty.  Ireland was more equal in terms of the income distribution than at any time this decade. <\/p>  <p>  However, the results also show that we have a long way to go to achieve the national social target for poverty reduction.  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show further improvement.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals. <\/p>  <p>  The Survey indicates that the consistent poverty rate, for people in households headed by a person who was unable to work due to illness or a disability, was 22.4% in 2015.  This compared to 14.4% the year before.  However, this figure (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) has been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the change over the year is statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.  It is worth noting, moreover, that there was no change if the level of deprivation reported for this group of households in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Adaption Grant Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Websites","counter":655,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK04500"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[6766\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK04600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the JobsIreland website is the only online vacancy and job matching service available to local employment services and Intreo, and the only method of advertising for vacancies in employment programmes, such as community employment schemes, permitted by his Department (details supplied).","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p><i>Jobsireland.ie<\/i>is a free online jobs site that enables employers to post job opportunities and jobseekers to search and apply for these opportunities online.

In fact most employers that currently have a defined benefit scheme also operate a parallel defined contribution scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Social Protection nor the Pensions Authority are empowered under legislation to interfere either in the scenario of a defined benefit scheme being wound up or to compel an employer to make pension contributions to a scheme.  Occupational pension schemes are generally set up under trust and are contributed to by an employer on a voluntary basis.  In almost all Irish defined benefit schemes employers are not prohibited from ceasing contributions, usually after a notice period.   <\/p>  <p>  It has to be said that many employers have made great efforts to support their pension schemes and have tried to make good the promises made to scheme members.  Of course there are employers who have not.<\/p>  <p>  Sometimes sponsoring employers can no longer afford to pay for the level of pensions expected by members of defined benefit schemes.  In some cases defined benefit schemes have been frozen and employers have opened up defined contribution schemes for their employees.  They continue to pay into these schemes for their employees.<\/p>  <p>  This process is usually managed through dialogue and negotiation between employers, employee representatives, trustees and members.  Enhanced transfer values may be offered to encourage members to move to defined contribution schemes. <\/p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this position is not unique to Ireland.  In the UK 85% of defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of increased employer obligations has recently been generating much discussion but it should be remembered that such unilateral modifications to a sector could yield unwanted side effects.  Any changes to the Pensions Act that legislatively alters the relationship between a pension scheme and its sponsoring employer could have far-reaching implications for pensioners and the pension sector as a whole, as well as the employers.  These could include prompting well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid new obligations; threatening a company&rsquo;s financial stability; rendering some employers insolvent; and\/or giving a competitive advantage to employers who either never provided a pension and\/or put defined contribution schemes in place. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I are not just keeping a watching brief on the defined benefit sector but are very much involved in the development of proposals for the reform of pensions within the current economic climate. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK07200"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[7164\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400070#WRK07300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of households in receipt of rent supplement, with a breakdown according to the reason for the reduction in the numbers on rent supplement since January 2015 and including the numbers moved on to housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS; the number coming off rent supplement due to being permanently housed in local authority or approved housing body housing; the number coming off rent supplement as a result of becoming homeless; the number coming off rent supplement as a result of moving in with family members; and the number coming off rent supplement as a result of no longer needing any social housing support.","asker":"1254","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>The rent supplement scheme plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme currently supporting approximately 47,100 tenants for which the Government has provided &euro;253 million for in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Rent supplement customer numbers have declined by some 23,700 during the two years commencing January, 2015 (70,800) and ending January, 2017 (47,100) representing a 33% decline over the period under consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Since January 2015 there have been approximately 18,000 housing assistance payment (HAP) recipients brought onto the scheme of which 6,000 (33%) have been accredited as direct transfers from rent supplement.

Additionally, a more streamlined service delivery partner model would assist CIB in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations, help to promote awareness of the wide range of services and supports available to citizens on behalf of Government, and, in so doing, further raise the profile of both MABS and CIS Services.  <\/p><p>In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services, and &euro;24 million is allocated to the network of MABS services. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Benefit","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[7291\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the decision on the application for maternity benefit by a person (details supplied) could be reviewed in view of their long-term employment history and contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>An application for maternity benefit by the person concerned was refused on the grounds that she was not in insurable employment at the time of her application. <\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for payment of maternity benefit, in addition to meeting the PRSI contribution condition for the tax year relevant to the claim the person concerned must also be in insurable employment that is covered by the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.

The Implementation Plan, envisaged a significant works programme comprising of physical works as well as economic and social initiatives, all with the aim of improving the lives of people living in the Regeneration communities and in the wider city areas.<\/p><p>My cabinet colleague, Minister Coveney launched the Review of the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan in Limerick on 9 December 2016.  The review of the Plan is an important milestone which examines progress across a number of thematic areas including youth unemployment using common socio-economic indicators. <\/p><p>Amongst the actions being supported under the overall Regeneration programme are precise actions to support work training and skills development focused on addressing youth unemployment.  Training for residents in new work skills and investment in community and social enterprises and in strategic projects has resulted in over 300 jobs.  The regeneration-supported Hospitality Education and Training Centre in Roxboro has achieved an exceptional 85% placement rate from the training course that finished recently and of some 250 full and part-time jobs that have been secured to date, 220 went to people from the regeneration areas.<\/p><p>Investment in school services, community centres, family support and youth work and activities for young people, have supported increased attendance at schools, a reduction in early school leaving and higher numbers going on to third level education which will all ultimately help improve levels of youth unemployment.  A dedicated resource for economic development in regeneration areas has been established within Limerick City and County Council to provide a focal point for Community Enterprise, Agencies and the private sector and drive forward the key recommendations of the Review.  The next phase of economic development will concentrate on projects of scale that will become city wide catalysts for economic development and ensure a sector-focused skills training approach and include replication of the successful model employed for the Hospitality Education &amp;amp; Training Centre. <\/p><p>At national level, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment &ndash; including youth unemployment &ndash; is twofold.  The <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i>support continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020<\/i>. <\/p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in reducing youth unemployment.  Youth unemployment is generally higher than adult unemployment in all EU member states &ndash; because, at any time, a large number of young people are recent leavers from education and seeking a first job.  However, the most recent data show that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.1% in 2012 to 14.5% in December 2016.  Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 18.8%.<\/p><p>Policy continues to focus on support for the young unemployed.  Under the Youth Guarantee process there is monthly engagement by case officers with unemployed young people to assist them to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes.  <\/p><p>I am confident that these current and planned measures will support further reductions in youth unemployment, nationally as well as in Limerick. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Measures","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL01150"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[7409\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there are any other schemes to replace the Gateway scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>Gateway is a work placement scheme designed to provide short-term work opportunities for unemployed people in Local Authorities.

Indeed, the views of the international community on settlements couldn&rsquo;t be clearer &ndash; they are comprehensively set out in UN Security Council Resolution 2334 and in the declaration of the Paris Conference which I participated earlier this month.

In this case, I particularly welcome the signing, in March last year, of the Kafanchan Peace Declaration, which commits a range of stakeholders and community leaders to the principles of dialogue and non-violence in finding lasting solutions to the problems of inter-communal conflict.  The negotiation of this Declaration was facilitated by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue.  Ireland has supported the international work of this organisation for a number of years, including through the provision of &euro;100,000 in 2016 for its work in Nigeria.  Our Embassy staff in Abuja attended the signing of the Declaration, and continue to monitor and report on the situation in the region.  We will continue to encourage all parties to engage in the ongoing efforts to address the roots causes of this conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Missing Persons","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL02850"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[6920\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400071#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that 7 February 2017 would have marked the twenty-fifth birthday of a person (details supplied) who went missing in the south of Spain in the summer of 2008 and that a vigil was held outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on that date; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that members of the person&rsquo;s family are calling on the Government to request that the Spanish authorities launch a cold case investigation; and if he will raise the issue with his Spanish counterpart.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>I am fully aware that a vigil was held on 7 February outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to mark the 25th birthday of the citizen who remains missing in Spain since 2008.

The Decree, issued under the State of Emergency which has been in place in Turkey since the failed coup in July 2016, has been used to target officials at the Education Ministry, the gendarmerie, and academics, as well as many other public servants, for their suspected links with certain organisations, e.g. the G&uuml;lenist movement. <\/p>  <p>  This Decree brings the numbers of public servants dismissed since the coup to almost 100,000 people.  Many others have been detained or arrested.  I acknowledge that Orders issued on 23 January limit the period of detention without charge to seven days rather than 30, and establish a complaints process for those who feel they have been mistreated under the emergency measures.  However, this latest round of dismissals heightens my ongoing concerns about human rights, democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression in Turkey.  I once again call on the Turkish authorities to exercise restraint in responding to the challenges they continue to face in the post-coup environment.    <\/p>  <p>  I am monitoring closely the Constitutional amendment package which was approved by the Turkish Grand Assembly on 21 January.  President Erdogan, who was the originator of many of the proposed changes, gave his formal approval to the package on 10 February.  The proposed amendments will now be put to the people in a referendum scheduled to take place on 16 April.  Among the proposals are provisions for an increase in the number of MPs from 550 to 600, a lowering of the minimum age to sit in Parliament from 25 to 18, the holding of concurrent parliamentary and presidential elections every five years, the abolition of the post of Prime Minister and a considerable expansion of the executive powers of the President. <\/p>  <p>  While the Head of State in many democracies has a strong executive function, the ongoing concerns at EU level and internationally about democracy and the rule of law in Turkey, mean that there are serious considerations about the substance, timing and context of the constitutional proposals.

Our community rated market is supported by a Risk Equalisation Scheme funded by a community rating levy payable by insurers on all written policies.  The levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners from insurers and all of the monies collected are paid over to the Risk Equalisation Fund administered by the independent regulator - the Health Insurance Authority.  The Authority redistributes the monies back to the health insurance companies by way of credits in respect of older and sicker people.  The scheme is designed to protect community rating by spreading the cost of insuring older and sicker people across the market and allows all people to continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product.<\/p><p>It is important to note that increasing the stamp duty levies does not increase costs across the market.  The Scheme is exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.  Insurance companies operate as commercial providers and as Minister for Health, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s prices.  The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations.  Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premiums payable.<\/p><p>We have a highly competitive private health insurance market.  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority website offers a clear price comparison and can be accessed at <i>www.hia.ie<\/i>.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.<\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of Government to support older people to remain in their own homes and communities, and maintain their independence, for as long as possible.  However, there will always be a cohort of people for whom this is not an option, despite the level of support that might be provided to them in their homes, and so full-time nursing home care is indeed best suited to meet their care needs.  This is why the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is so important.  <\/p>  <p>  The first step in the NHSS application process is a care needs assessment to identify whether or not the applicant needs long-term nursing home care.  This is carried out by appropriate health care professionals, appointed by the HSE, using the Common Summary Assessment Report (CSAR).  This assessment will include consideration of the following:<\/p>  <p>  -  a person's ability to carry out the activities of daily living;<\/p>  <p>  -  the medical, health and personal social services being provided or available to the person both at the time of the carrying out of the assessment and generally;<\/p>  <p>  -  the family and community support available;<\/p>  <p>  -  the person's wishes and preferences. <\/p>  <p>  On completion of the assessment, the healthcare professionals involved will summarise their findings in the CSAR and submit this to the Local Placement Forum (LPF).  The LPF will then consider the CSAR and make a determination as to whether the applicant requires care services, and also whether the applicant is likely to require care services for the remainder of their life.  This is a comprehensive process and has been put in place to ensure that there is no doubt surrounding whether a person has a requirement for long-term nursing home care or not.  The LPF in all locations consists of a multidisciplinary team and in general is supported by a Consultant Geriatrician where they are available.  <\/p>  <p>  The comprehensive care needs assessment conducted as part of the NHSS application process, together with the fact that older people are entering residential care facilities later in life, mean that those entering long-term residential care will have reasonably high levels of dependency. <\/p>  <p>  All nursing homes - public, private and voluntary - are registered and inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and to monitor safety in Ireland's health and personal social care services.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive framework, including the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People and the Health Act, 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2013.  The Regulations require that registered providers must ensure that the number and skill mix of staff is appropriate having regard to the assessed needs of the residents and the size and layout of the designated centre. <\/p>  <p>  Nursing homes provide an important resource in the range of care services available to older people in Ireland.  They play a vital role in ensuring that older people have access to the high quality of care and support they deserve at a vulnerable stage in their lives.  <\/p>  <p>  Homecare is an increasingly important part of the supports that we offer to older people, and will continue to increase in importance into the future.  Services are provided on the basis of assessed health care need and there is no means testing.  However, home care services are not currently formally regulated.  It is my view, and that of the Government, that we need a stand-alone funding scheme designed for homecare that recognises its particular characteristics together with regulation of homecare services.  The development of a regulatory and funding model for homecare services is a complex undertaking involving very significant legislative, operational and financial resources.  The development of such a scheme is a priority for me, as Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400073#WRN06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400074#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[6711\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400074#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied); and when the person can expect an appointment at Tallaght Hospital.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In December, I granted approval to the NTPF for a &euro;5m initiative focusing on daycase procedures which will aim to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure, including in gynaecology, by 30 June.  <\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to submit a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 in respect of both the Inpatient\/Daycase and the Outpatient Waiting Lists.  The focus of these plans will be to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October 2017.  As part of these plans the HSE has been asked to target specialties, services and hospitals with highest numbers of long waiters as well as improving in-sourcing in public sector, within and across Hospital Groups.  In addition, on 23 January, I wrote to the HSE requesting that, in developing these Action Plans, a particular focus be given to reducing waiting times in gynaecology.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are difficulties in relation to waiting times for gynaecology services in Cork University Hospital.  On 12 January, I visited the hospital to meet with hospital management, South\/South West Hospital Group management and a number of consultant obstetricians\/gynaecologists, to learn at first-hand about these problems, which are in part due to staff resource challenges including those associated with recruiting Theatre Staff Nurses.  I have asked my officials to work closely with the HSE and the Hospital Group to ensure that the waiting list for gynaecology procedures is addressed as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital has advised that the provision of additional gynaecology operating capacity is a priority for the Executive Management Board, as is the optimisation of output from those theatres sessions already in place.  In that regard, the Board is working with the Gynaecology Department and the Hospital Group to maximise capacity in the theatre sessions already in place, recruit additional Theatre Staff Nurses to provide additional theatre time and to progress the introduction of pre-admission assessment for these patients to improve efficiencies and patient flow.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the newly established National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP).  The NWIHP will lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services, ensure the consistent delivery of high quality care in these services and oversee the development of maternity networks.  Governance arrangements for the networks will be agreed between the NWIHP and the hospital group CEOs.  It will facilitate greater oversight and support for service providers.<\/p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the new maternity network which is currently being established in the South\/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) will ensure better coordination and utilisation of maternity and gynaecological resources across the group.  In that regard, I am pleased to note the very recent appointment of Professor John Higgins as Clinical Director Women and Children Services for the SSWHG.  I am advised that Prof. Higgins will assume clinical and executive responsibility for maternity services in the Group's four maternity hospitals viz Cork University Maternity Hospital, University Hospital Kerry, University Hospital Waterford and South Tipperary General Hospital on the 28 of February next.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly on the specific questions raised concerning the assessment of patients on the Cork University Hospital gynaecology waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400074#WRO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":942,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400074#WRO03350"},{"type":"question","counter":943,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[6787\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400074#WRO03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will secure an appointment in Beaumont Hospital for lumbar epidural injections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Subsequently a related Chairman&rsquo;s note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement set out a framework for progressing this matter, encompassing the transfer of 4 tasks (including 1st dose antibiotics, phlebotomy, cannulation and discharge where appropriate) from doctors to nurses.  A final agreement on the transfer of tasks was concluded on 17th December 2015 encompassing the roll-out of the transfer of the identified tasks and the provision of training where required for the acute sector.  While there was some delay in payment arrangements being finalised all nurses and midwives working 6-8pm in the acute sector are now receiving payment (time and one sixth) and should also have received backmoney for the period from 1 January 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The focus of the Agreement is on improving patient care and supporting early and timely interventions.  It is noted that the tasks are to be transferred in the context of the provision of the necessary training programmes, relevant resources being available, existing arrangements for the provision of some of the tasks, for example phlebotomy teams, and that doctors would continue to perform the tasks.  A core principle is that the task is undertaken by the staff member who is most appropriate to do so at that time and in that location.  The National Implementation and Verification Group was satisfied that the tasks had been transferred in all HSE and voluntary hospitals on the basis provided for in the Agreement or that the roll-out of the training programmes had been progressed sufficiently to justify payment under the terms of the Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400077#WRR03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental

As a result of investment, we made some progress but there is much more to do to provide the level service that is needed.  <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEO of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) to discuss immediate action that can be taken to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  <\/p>  <p>  While the new theatre in OLCHC was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being used  for scoliosis surgery due to challenges with recruiting nurses.  The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses with the necessary paediatric training.  As a result four new nurses will be in place by April.  A further 16 international nurses have been offered posts, and have commenced the registration process.  The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.

If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p><p>The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by ComReg. \u00a0I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll out services to particular locations.  However,\u00a0mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has, however, increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.<\/p><p>Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with\u00a0Minister Humphreys to\u00a0identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate\u00a0how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.

The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment plans have not been fully demonstrated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400083#WRX02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord na M&oacute;na","counter":1558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400083#WRX02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1559,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[6851\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400083#WRX02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the possible reduction in the number of jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na.","asker":"1309","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1560,"content":"<p>Bord na M&oacute;na is a commercial State company operating under the Turf Development Acts 1946 to 1998.

Depending on the overall approach adopted by the National Planning Framework on this issue of better integration between land-use planning and transport planning, there may well be a need to expand upon the NTA's legal powers in relation to\u00a0land-use planning outside the GDA, which would again require careful consideration of how best to ensure that any Advisory Council reflects the full range of relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  On the basis of the above, I think it best to await the development of the National Planning Framework to ensure that its recommendations can be reflected in both the composition of any future NTA Advisory Council and\u00a0its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400084#WRY06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Improvement Schemes","counter":1661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400084#WRY06600"},{"type":"question","counter":1662,"qnumday":639,"qnumall":"[7111\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400084#WRY06700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to upgrade routes (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1663,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads (including the R194 from Virginia to the Oldcastle Road and the R194 from Virginia to Granard Co.

The programme commenced in 2013 and was designed as a time-bound co-funding arrangement of &euro;29.7 million, in conjunction with the Atlantic Philanthropies.  <\/p>  <p>  In budget 2016, my Department secured an additional &euro;4.5 million to extend the entire existing ABC programme to the end of December 2017, bringing the total investment to &euro;34.2 million.

With this in mind, my Department has also been preparing a significant programme that will assist in mainstreaming the learning from various prevention and early intervention initiatives, including the ABC programme. <\/p>  <p>  This Quality and Capacity Building Initiative (QCBI) aims to embed prevention and early intervention in services for children and young people, through resourcing a system change across service provision in this area.  QCBI involves creating valuable tools that capture key data and learning, and make it accessible, in addition to developing cross-sectoral capacity building measures.  Such measures will seek to enhance the quality of prevention and early intervention approaches, as well as fostering partnership among agencies and professionals who engage with children at risk of poor outcomes.  This work has been informed in part, by an important EU Peer Review hosted by my Department in 2016 which emphasised the importance of an evidenced based approach to tackling child poverty, and which specifically acknowledged the importance of prevention and early intervention in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with interested stakeholders in working on mainstreaming the learning from existing programmes and improving the lives of children across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400085#WRZ06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":1733,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400085#WRZ06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1734,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[6675\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400085#WRZ06300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the actions she is taking to ensure that child care providers in the community setting have the resources to ensure adequate staff to maintain current capacity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1735,"content":"<p>I recently announced that &euro;1m of additional funding will be made available to childcare providers who have been facilitating the training of Community Employment (CE) scheme workers, to ensure that regulatory changes do not impact on service delivery or the availability of childcare places. <\/p>  <p>  In preparation for the implementation of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, Childcare Committees Ireland were commissioned by my Department to investigate the impact of new childcare regulations on community childcare providers.<\/p>  <p>  This research indicated that the vast majority of services would not face financial hardship as a result of changes required under the regulations.

In 2011 this scheme was closed to new entrants while under the remit of the Family Support Agency.  The scheme came under the remit of Tusla upon its establishment in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla recognises the necessity for bereavement and loss counselling  in schools and those schools in receipt of funding under the School Completion Programme may utilise up to &euro;5,000 of this funding for such services.  In addition Tusla provides child counselling through the Agency&rsquo;s Family Support Services funding.  In 2016 funding for child counselling was increased under this scheme by &euro;154,000 to &euro;680,000.  In particular child counselling funding to approximately 70 Family Resource Centres around Ireland was increased to &euro;242,000.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is the main funder of Barnardos Children&rsquo;s Bereavement Service, which works to support children and families coping with bereavement.  Funding of &euro;154,600 was provided to this service in 2016.  The Agency is also committed to the funding of Rainbows Ireland, which provides group based support to children dealing with loss following parental separation\/divorce or a death.  The Rainbows programme is currently delivered in over 250 schools and community based centres around the country.  Funding in 2016 was increased by &euro;15,000 to &euro;250,000 annually.  Together with the Irish Hospice Foundation Tusla co-funds the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network, which works to improve awareness and support of bereaved children.

element of the Scheme will be available to all families with children between the age of six months and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the free pre-school programme if later than 36 months).  The targeted element of the scheme will involve a progressive system of income-related subsidies for parents with children between 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility based on net parental income.  A family may receive either the universal or the targeted subsidy, not both.  The subsidy provided will be whichever of the universal and targeted payment is most favourable to a family.<\/p><p>The scheme will be available in childcare providers who are registered with Tusla, including both centre-based childcare providers (e.g. cr&egrave;ches, preschools and daycare centres) and child-minders.<\/p><p>For parents with net incomes up to &euro;22,700 per annum, the maximum rate of childcare subsidy will be payable.  The rate of subsidy will taper downwards as net income rises, with no means-tested\/income related subsidy payable when net income reaches &euro;47,500.  For families with net income levels above this threshold, the universal subsidy may be available, depending on the age of the child.<\/p><p>The amount of subsidy provided, in relation to both the universal and targeted subsidies, depends on (a) the number of hours of childcare used per week, and (b) the number of weeks of childcare used per year.  The amount of subsidy does not depend on the number of hours worked, except in that a maximum of 15 subsidised hours of childcare will be available if a parent is engaged in neither work nor study.  The subsidy estimates in the table assume that each family uses 40 or more hours of childcare per week, and pays for year-round childcare.  If fewer than 40 hours of childcare are used per week, or childcare is used for only part of the year, the annual subsidy will be reduced pro rata.<\/p><p>The subsidy estimates in the table assume that the families in question have no income from other sources, including no other social welfare payments, and that they are making no pension contributions.  It should be noted that the amount of subsidy payable will also depend on other incomes that a family may receive, as well as on the family&rsquo;s tax arrangements, their level of pension contributions, and other arrangements such as maintenance payments.

When a young person is referred to Tusla EWS by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla EWS operates three specific programmes.  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) provided to 400 DEIS schools to facilitate positive relationships between parents and their children&rsquo;s school.  The School Completion Programme (SCP) provides intensive supports to students at risk of early school leaving to enable these students to complete their education.  Both of these programmes intervene at the earliest stage when school attendance or school participation difficulties emerge in order to support parents, students and schools to address any difficulties early.  When these interventions fail to address the presenting problem a referral is made to the Statutory Education Welfare Service. <\/p>  <p>  When a formal referral is made action taken then falls into two distinct categories.  The first is a brief intervention (provided to 3,751 pupils in 2015\/2016 school year) whereby low level intervention proportionate to the need of the individual and the family can often effectively resolve the issue, thus preventing attendance problems escalating.

Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from Tusla EWS to make progress.  Such work can involve developing a plan with the family, young person and school to address the various barriers identified.  These intensive interventions are used when brief interventions have not been successful, or are not appropriate in the circumstances.

Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers.  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks.  Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).   <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and abroad, on an as available basis.  In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.  The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24\/7 transport service.  This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis.  This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose.  However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed.   <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced.  This is largely because the Air Corp has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel which is outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  This has led to a shortage of experienced pilots which has reduced the number of available flying crews. Due to these crew shortages, aircraft availability for the inter-hospital air ambulance service is reduced.  Every effort is being made to address these personnel shortages faced by the Air Corps.  A plan is in place, which it is currently working through, to increase the number of pliots.  There are 28 cadets, in 3 classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots.  However, this will only yield results in the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  My officials will continue to keep the Department of Health and the HSE fully informed of the situation in the Air Corps so that the HSEs Aeromedical Desk can ensure the arrangements they have for the transport service are as robust as possible.   <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Air Corps will continue to provide as much support for emergency inter-hospital transfers as possible, having regard to available capabilities and its primary responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400087#WRBB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cyber Security Policy","counter":1847,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400087#WRBB03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1848,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[6878\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017021400087#WRBB03300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the actions his Department is taking to protect against cyber attacks after the NTMA website was temporarily down for several hours after a suspected hacking attack; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1849,"content":"<p>Cyber security, cyber crime and internet security represent challenges that are constantly evolving and require vigilance and appropriate responses.
