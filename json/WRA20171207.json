It is precisely for that reason that Rebuilding Ireland has prioritised the supply of new homes to meet current and pent-up demand as well as helping to moderate house prices and rents. <\/p><p>A range of measures\u00a0has been taken to address this, for example, in relation to planning reforms to provide flexibility and certainty\u00a0in delivering viable housing schemes and apartment developments in the right locations, the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones, and the establishment of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), to deliver new homes that are more viable\u00a0and\u00a0more affordable than would otherwise be the case.<\/p><p>The primary objective of\u00a0LIHAF is to stimulate and accelerate the early release of land for housing in urban areas with large demand, by opening up these lands with key enabling public infrastructure that would otherwise not be provided in the short term. The resulting increase in the supply of new houses\u00a0on both private and public lands is key to tackling price and affordability, as lack of supply is one of the main factors currently inflating house prices.<\/p><p>As required under the LIHAF scheme's criteria and conditions, local authorities were asked, inter alia, to obtain commitments from housing providers on associated sites in relation to housing delivery timelines and cost reductions.\u00a0 The objective of securing cost reductions is to make the housing more affordable than would otherwise be the case and the level of the reduction is proportionate to the scale of the LIHAF investment in the enabling infrastructure for each project.\u00a0 In many of the projects, local authorities will aggregate LIHAF deductions to provide more affordable housing, under qualifying criteria to be set in line with the forthcoming national policy on affordability.\u00a0 Of course, there will also be a social housing dividend from all of the LIHAF sites, together with additional social and affordable housing to be provided on the State-owned sites.<\/p><p>As part of Budget 2018, I announced an additional &euro;50 million funding which will be available for a second LIHAF call and which will again be subject to matching funding of 25% by local authorities. This will facilitate the provision of more public infrastructure to unlock further sites and activate more housing supply.\u00a0A further call for proposals under LIHAF is likely early in 2018.<\/p><p>As regards the use of publicly owned land for the delivery of homes, it is crucial that the State's housing land bank is developed as soon as possible.\u00a0To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with these lands having\u00a0the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally.

On average, 350 new households are supported by HAP each week in 2017, and the Rebuilding Ireland 2017 target of supporting 15,000 additional households with the scheme has been exceeded. <\/p><p>The introduction of the HAP scheme was underpinned by an economic assessment, which was submitted to Government in 2013, and informed the Government&rsquo;s decision to initiate the HAP scheme at that time. Although the HAP scheme was seen initially as being Exchequer neutral, external factors have impacted on this initial conclusion (in particular,\u00a0the challenging state of the private rental market), and other benefits such as employment activation for HAP recipients, assistance with tax compliance of landlords for Revenue, improvement in private rental standards, better regulation of the private rental market, and\u00a0reduction in local authority administration due to a central transactional shared service, should also be taken into consideration when looking at value for money.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that in developing the HAP scheme, every effort has been made to provide similar levels of long-term support to other forms of social housing, while allowing for far greater flexibility of support, including a speed of access to the scheme that\u00a0is as comparable to Rent Supplement. All parties to the administration of the scheme are committed to providing prospective HAP tenants with the capacity to compete for good quality, appropriate accommodation in the private market in an area they want to live in.<\/p><p>It should also be borne in mind that the HAP scheme was implemented on a statutory phased basis since 2014, and 2018 will be the first full year of operation in all local authority areas. The evidence of the success of the HAP scheme suggests that many households want what HAP offers them, i.e. flexible housing support with access to long-term options, at a rent that is based on their ability to pay, and the security of knowing that they can work full-time without losing their long-term housing support.

The Review is being undertaken in accordance with Section 5 of that Act. <\/p>  <p>  The key objective of defamation law in Ireland is to ensure effective protection for the right to good name and reputation guaranteed by Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution, while also ensuring due regard for the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society, contained in Article 40.4.1(i). The rights to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and to protection of reputation under Article 8 of the Convention are also relevant.<\/p>  <p>  The overall question posed by the public consultation is whether the 2009 Act strikes the right balance, in practice, between protecting freedom of expression and protecting good name and reputation &ndash; taking account of relevant developments such as intervening jurisprudence, changes in other common-law jurisdictions and the increasing importance of digital communications. Specifically, the aims of the public consultation were as follows:<\/p>  <p>-\u00a0To promote an exchange of views and experiences regarding the operation in practice of reforms to the 2009 Act,<\/p>  <p>- To review recent reforms of defamation law in other relevant jurisdictions,<\/p>  <p>-\u00a0To examine whether Irish defamation law, and in particular the Defamation Act 2009, remains appropriate and effective for securing its objectives, including in light of any relevant developments since 2009, <\/p>  <p>- To explore and weigh the arguments (and evidence) for and against any proposed changes in Irish defamation law intended to better respond to its objectives, and<\/p>  <p>- To publish the outcomes of the review, with recommendations on appropriate follow-up measures<\/p>  <p>  The Department received 41 submissions to the review from a wide variety of\u00a0stakeholders.\u00a0The submissions are published and available on the Department&rsquo;s website.

As I set out below significant issues arose with that mechanism which made it impossible for Ireland to deliver on the numbers allocated to it, primarily because those numbers do not actually exist on the ground in the relevant counties.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the Government has had to find other mechanisms to deliver on the commitment by Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the\u00a0programme refugee resettlement strand of the Programme, 356 persons arrived in Ireland during 2016.\u00a0 Taken together with the previous year's intake,\u00a0Ireland had taken in 519 of its\u00a0original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016, a year ahead of schedule.\u00a0 Last year, the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the total who have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 785.\u00a0 The balance are expected to arrive in early 2018.\u00a0 The European Commission recognises Ireland as being one of only seven EU Member States to have fulfilled their resettlement pledges from the July 2015 Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland committed to accept 2,622 asylum seekers under the relocation strand of the\u00a0IRPP.  This total was composed of 1,089 people from Greece, 623 people from Italy and 910 people that were &ldquo;unallocated&rdquo; by the Commission.  Ireland plans to meet in full its commitment to Greece.\u00a0 693 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State,\u00a0with a further 62 persons scheduled for arrival in December 2017.\u00a0 By early 2018,\u00a0it is expected that Ireland will have relocated its entire cohort from Greece (1,089), subject of course to the Greek authorities submitting the small number of remaining case files to Ireland and the ability of local authorities to find homes in communities around Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  However, Italy, unlike Greece, did\u00a0 not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory.  Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments in Italy\u00a0of the asylum seeker cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.\u00a0 It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy despite the most intensive efforts by Ireland to resolve the impasse, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to \u00a0910 persons,\u00a0Ireland could not access this component because the EU did not ultimately decide to operationalise this additional commitment.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the Deputy may wish to note that by the end of the two-year EU Relocation Programme in September 2017, just 37,000 asylum seekers were eligible and registered for relocation in Italy and Greece out of an total of 160,000 comprehended by the two Council Decisions, of which 78% (approximately 29,000) had been relocated to other EU Member States including Ireland.  It should be noted that proportionally Ireland has taken one of the highest numbers under the EU Relocation Programme.  Once the final transfers from Greece take place early next year, Ireland will have relocated more than 3% of the EU&rsquo;s total figure.  This represents a strong commitment by Ireland to EU solidarity, given that we represent less than 1% of the total population of the EU.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has worked\u00a0to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions and will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for resettlement of\u00a0programme refugees.\u00a0 To address the balance of approximately 1,800 people under the IRPP, which arises largely due to the significantly smaller number of asylum seekers eligible and registered under the EU relocation programme, I have recently announced additional resettlement pledges for 2018 and 2019 amounting to an additional commitment of about 945 refugees, and the establishment of a new Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP). \u00a0The resettlement pledges are the largest commitments for resettlement that we have made in a calendar year since our national resettlement programme began in 2000.  They have been made in in the context of a European Commission\/UNHCR resettlement pledging exercise for 2018\/2019, which aims to provide 50,000 resettlement places across the European Union over the two-year period.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, following the adoption of the All-Party Motion last November, on the Calais Unaccompanied Minors, a concerted effort has been made to provide a pathway here for such unaccompanied minors who wished to come to Ireland.  The Departments of\u00a0 Children and Youth Affairs and Justice and Equality, established the Calais Special Project within Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. Working directly with the French authorities, any unaccompanied minors who have been identified as suitable for relocation here have been accepted and provided with the appropriate supports and no unaccompanied minor who has asked to come to Ireland has been refused.  A total of 30 young persons have been relocated under this programme to-date.  There are an additional 11 children who have been assessed and are awaiting security clearance before travel arrangement can be made for them.  In addition to the children that have been brought to Ireland under the Calais Special Project an additional 6 young people from Syria have been admitted to Ireland under the EU Relocation Programme from Greece.<\/p>  <p>  In all the circumstances,\u00a0I can state that Ireland is making\u00a0every possible effort to meet its commitments, the commitment by Ireland to accept 4,000 persons remains and that Ireland will fill any gaps arising from the relocation instruments using other mechanisms such as pledges for resettlement of\u00a0programme refugees.\u00a0 I am working to ensure that Ireland will meet its commitments by 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700077#WRG02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Data","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700077#WRG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[52493\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700077#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of section 102(1) referrals to GSOC from Garda headquarters in each of the years 2010 to 2016 and to date in 2017 relating to cases in which there was no death involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[52494\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700077#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of section 83(2) complaints received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that were referred to GSOC in each of the years 2010 to 2016 and to date in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.<\/p><p>The following information has been provided to my\u00a0Department by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission upon request.<\/p><p>I can advise the Deputy\u00a0that complaints made under section 83(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 are those that are either made directly\u00a0to the Garda Commissioner, to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a Garda station, or to a Garda member at or above the rank of chief superintendent at a place other than a Garda station.<\/p><p>Such complaints are commonly referred\u00a0by GSOC as section 85 complaints, taking into consideration the section of the Act that provides for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to forward these complaints to GSOC.<\/p><p>To facilitate the public in making a complaint at a Garda station, GSOC provides complaint forms (GSOC1 forms) that can be completed by a member of a public at a Garda station and submitted to GSOC from there. \u00a0GSOC has advised that as both referrals by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the GSOC1 forms, submitted to a Garda station by a member of the public, are identified as originating from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, their case management system classifies the Method of Receipt of Complaint as &ldquo;Garda Station&rdquo;. <\/p><p>In relation to section 102(1) referrals made to GSOC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this information is published in the Ombudsman Commission's annual report.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>The Garda strength of the\u00a0Roscommon\/Longford Division on 31 October 2017 was 309\u00a0with 9\u00a0Garda Reserves and\u00a029 Garda civilian staff\u00a0attached to the Division.  The Garda strength of the\u00a0Westmeath Division on 31 October 2017 was\u00a0266 with 13\u00a0Garda Reserves and\u00a024 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.\u00a0 To achieve this\u00a0the Government\u00a0has put\u00a0in place a plan for\u00a0an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide,\u00a0of whom 10 and 27\u00a0have been assigned to the\u00a0Roscommon\/Longford and Westmeath Divisions respectively.\u00a0 I look forward to attending the graduation of another 200 trainee Garda&iacute; tomorrow 8 December, which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also\u00a0pleased that Budget 2018\u00a0maintains this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensures that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark\u00a0by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to\u00a0fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.\u00a0 There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Roscommon\/Longford\u00a0 and Westmeath Divisions in the coming years.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Roscommon\/Longford and Westmeath Districts for\u00a0the past seven years and as of\u00a031 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available are\u00a0as set out in the following tables.<\/p><p><b>Strength of the Westmeath Districts<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Athlone<\/th><th>Mullingar<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>93<\/td><td>169<\/td><td>262<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>163<\/td><td>255<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>162<\/td><td>254<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>158<\/td><td>245<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>160<\/td><td>245<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>160<\/td><td>246<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>156<\/td><td>242<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017*<\/td><td>93<\/td><td>173<\/td><td>266<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*As of 31 October 2017<\/p><p><b>Strength of the Roscommon\/Longford Districts<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Boyle<\/th><th>Castlerea<\/th><th>Granard<\/th><th>Longford<\/th><th>Roscommon<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>301<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>46<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>74<\/td><td>90<\/td><td>286<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>280<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>82<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>285<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>82<\/td><td>285<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>82<\/td><td>292<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>80<\/td><td>301<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>89<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>88<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>309<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>As of 31 October 2017<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700078#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700078#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[52517\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700078#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 128 of 23 November 2017 regarding the case of a person (details supplied), if his attention has been drawn to the fact that no such permission issued; if the extension to stamp 4 will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the responsibility for the registration process and confiscated passport of the person concerned, is a matter which must ultimately be resolved between the person concerned and\u00a0their local Immigration Registration Office.  <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible. This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible. In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. <\/p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow. Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources. This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services. Service providers continue to keep the matter of transport under review.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to establishing a high level cross divisional working group this year to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies. The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities. The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services. The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities. A Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme is currently operated by the Revenue Commissioners which provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.<\/p>  <p>  As the remainder of the Deputy's relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700080#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Data","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700080#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[52420\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700080#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of times section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001 was invoked in each of the years 2015 and 2016 and to date in 2017 by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, by division, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[52421\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700080#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of times section 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001 was invoked in each of the years 2015 and 2016 and to date in 2017 between the hours of 6 pm and 9 am; the number that occurred at the weekend and bank holidays by division, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 and 132 together.<\/p><p>The statutory remit of the Mental Health Commission is to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres under this Act.

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings. A congregated setting is defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. <\/p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,<\/i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. <\/p><p>Just under 2,500 people with a disability remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.<\/p><p>I am pleased to note that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is providing funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2017. CAS funding is also available to provide housing for people with disabilities in the community more generally that is not specifically targeted at deinstitutionalisation.  HSE Managers at Community Health Organisation level engage with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to provide a letter of approval confirming that they are supportive of the application and this it is in line with national guidance for housing of people with disabilities.

It takes a life course approach, which is a key underpinning concept in the Healthy Ireland Framework under which the Strategy will be implemented.  It acknowledges the importance of developing a healthy attitude to sexuality in young people and of building on that foundation for positive sexual health and well-being into adulthood and older age.<\/p>  <p>  The publication of the National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020 provided the opportunity to ensure that all efforts across the entire range of sexual health &ndash; from awareness, education, training, access, treatment and surveillance &ndash; are co-ordinated, evidence informed and based on best practice. <\/p>  <p>  The National Sexual Health Strategy has been developed against a backdrop of a changing Ireland regarding sexual behaviour and sexuality in recent decades. This changing landscape is evident in legislation introduced in recent years, and more openness generally in attitudes and culture around sexuality and sexual health issues.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy was developed based on three goals:<\/p>  <p>  - Everyone in Ireland will receive comprehensive and age-appropriate sexual health education\/information and will have access to appropriate prevention and promotion services;<\/p>  <p>  - Equitable, accessible and high quality sexual health services, which are targeted and tailored to need, will be available to everyone; and<\/p>  <p>  - Robust and high quality sexual health information will be generated to underpin policy, practice, service planning and strategic monitoring.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the diversity of sexual identities. It supports all expressions of sexual identity through positive sexual health and well-being outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  Governance structures for implementation of the National Sexual Health Strategy have been established. The HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme is the national programme charged with developing and implementing a national strategy to, among other things, improve the effectiveness and impact of sexual health services and preventative work. The programme is responsible for developing and implementing an action plan for each year of the Strategy.  A Clinical Lead for Sexual Health has also been appointed in the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has worked with the Department of Education Skills (DES) for several years to support the Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) Programme. In partnership with the DES, the HSE has developed RSE lesson plans for teachers; the TRUST resource for senior cycle RSE and the B4uDecide Resource for Junior Cycle RSE.  Over 60% of schools use these resources, according to the Lifeskills Survey. The HSE also developed B4uDecide.ie, a website for 14-16 years olds with trustworthy information on relationships and sexual health.  It includes videos, quizzes and polls that teachers use as part of their RSE classes. There are 80,000 visits to the website every year. The Programme also supports RSE in youth clubs and funds the REAL U &ndash; a very popular RSE resource developed by Foroige. Funding is also provided to the National Parents Council to provide RSE seminars to parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700083#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Accommodation Provision","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700083#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[52479\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700083#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the policy regarding building a community nursing home and the prevention of displacement of existing private providers that live in close proximity thereto (details supplied).","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":414,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to enhancing the quality of life of older people, maintaining their full potential, supporting them in their homes and communities, providing access to respite care and day care and, when required, providing access to appropriate quality long-term residential care.<\/p>  <p>  Residential care in Ireland is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2017 is &euro;940m and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will support over 23,000 people by the end of the year.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. A key principle of the Scheme is that applicants can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.<\/p>  <p>  Community Nursing Units like Ballinasloe are an essential part of our national infrastructure of nursing homes. They provide over 5,000 long stay residential care beds or approximately 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds nationally.  Ballinasloe Community Nursing Unit is a purpose designed building.  The centre has opened on a phased basis, initially with 25 residents.  Earlier this year the Unit increased the maximum number of persons that can be accommodated to 50 residents. <\/p>  <p>  The demand for residential services will continue to grow with changing demographics, and the associated complex needs of an ageing population.

The process governing the assessment and consideration of fisheries Natura plans is set out in the European Union (Birds and Natural Habitats) (Sea-fisheries) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 290 of 2013).<\/p><p>Prior to any harvesting being allowed in the proposed fishing area, the area would also need to be classified by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority for the production of cockles under food safety legislation.<\/p><p>I am not aware of any requests to develop a commercial fishery for cockles in this area at this time.  I would encourage members of the fishing industry looking to explore the potential for a viable fishery in the area in question to bring their proposals to the South East Regional Inshore Fisheries Forum for discussion and consideration.

This means that for now at least the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of yesterday will bring the parents who planned to apply some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision. The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities. No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. <\/p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010. At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two. Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six. The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland. Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities. If children are not in school by six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school. (Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education. Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.) <\/p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development. The two main enhancements are:<\/p>  <p>  - ECCE entitlement currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018. This is in keeping with good international practice.<\/p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities. Over 4,000 children have so far benefitted from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.<\/p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme. This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018. The motivation underpinning this development is entirely evidence based. Children with a disability benefit from early intervention, high quality early childhood care and education and high quality primary school education.  In this regard my Department is complementing the work of the HSE's role in early intervention and the Department of Educations and Skill's role in high quality primary school education by:<\/p>  <p>  - expanding the ECCE programme so that all children have access to a full 76 weeks, double what was available in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  - providing access to the comprehensive suite of resources under the Access and Inclusion model (AIM), introduced in September 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high quality and inclusive primary school education. The evidence is also that they should become teenagers with their peers and transition to secondary school with their peers.<\/p>  <p>  This original decision to remove the overage exemption was made with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and in close collaboration with members of the AIM Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, the HSE, a representative of parents of children with special needs and a representative of early years providers. There was broad agreement that, in light of the very significant developments and improvements to free pre-school education, both in terms of the two year duration of ECCE and the range of supports available, and the very significant supports that are in place for children in primary schools, the overage exemption would no longer support the overarching policy aim that children should transition to primary school with their peers. The decision acknowledged the  supports provided by the relevant primary school, the National Council for Special Education and other bodies as required.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the strong evidence base underpinning this proposal as being in the best interests of the children concerned, and the significant enhancements to the ECCE scheme in terms of two years duration and access to AIM supports; measures which effectively address the reasons for introducing the overage exemptions in the first place, I am also conscious of the need to listen further to those with concerns. To this end, as stated above, I intend to pause the proposed change and consult more widely with parents of  children with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700090#WRU02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700090#WRU02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme Funding","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700090#WRU02300"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[52581\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700090#WRU02400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"his plans to provide specific funding to local authorities for the local improvement scheme in the road works programme for 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>My Department wrote to Local Authorities last August to establish the level of demand for a local improvement scheme this year.

Further inspection and audit will be carried out in 2018 under the LIS, and other schemes.<\/p><p>In the case of the Outdoor Rural Recreation Infrastructure scheme, the Town and Village Renewal scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme, Local Authorities are required to spend at least 20% of the total project cost before the first tranche payment of 50% of their allocation under the respective scheme can be drawn-down.

year, I launch a number of schemes that provide support for the development of rural communities.  These include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor\/Rural Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, the CL&Aacute;R Programme and the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS).<\/p><p>These schemes all include conditions which require works to have commenced and progressed before payments can be draw-down by Local Authorities.<\/p><p>In the case of the LIS, funding can be drawn down on certification by a Local Authority that 50% of their works have been completed and that all works will be fully completed by 31st December 2017.  In addition to Local Authority certification and desk-based checks by my officials, my Department's Inspection Services have completed on-the-spot verification checks on LIS roads in a number of counties and were able to verify that works had been completed to the level certified.  Further inspection and audit will be carried out in 2018 under the LIS, and other schemes.<\/p><p>In the case of the Outdoor Rural Recreation Infrastructure scheme, the Town and Village Renewal scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme, Local Authorities are required to spend at least 20% of the total project cost before the first tranche payment of 50% of their allocation under the respective scheme can be drawn-down.  The balance of funding will only be paid on full completion of the projects in question.<\/p><p>The release of the initial tranche of funding is also subject to satisfactory progress being demonstrated in respect of the 2016 schemes, where such funding was provided to the Local Authorities.<\/p><p>The table provided details the allocations made to each Local Authority under the schemes referred to above.  It also shows the payments made to each Local Authority up to 6th December 2017, on the basis of the criteria outlined above having been met.  I anticipate that further payments will be made before the end of the year.<\/p><p>It is important to note that apart from the LIS, the rural development schemes which were launched this year are expected to operate over a 12-15 month period.  Therefore, it was always anticipated that a portion of the funds allocated would be drawn-down in 2018.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th colspan=\"2\"><div><b>LIS 2017<\/b><\/div><\/th><th

In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows: <\/p>  <p>  -  Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (including food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.<\/p>  <p>  -  Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes becomes fully known.<\/p>  <p>  -  Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take some time before this stage of response commences.  Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.<\/p>  <p>  Following the flooding in Laois and Offaly, officials have provided financial support to the 57 affected households who have engaged with the Department and payments are continuing to be processed in these cases including some under Stage 2.  Latest figures show that &euro;13,000 has been paid to these households.  It is unclear at this time the level of funding that will be required to return homes to a habitable condition.  However, it is expected that the value of payments under the scheme will increase as we continue to move into Stage 2 and Stage 3 supports.  The scheme is demand led and there is a time-lag between the flooding event and actual claims for financial support.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.

In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Credits may also enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the level of payment of State pension contributory (SPC), but only where the individual has already met the condition relating to the minimum number of paid contributions.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for credits an individual must satisfy entitlement to the credits scheme.  While there are no self-employed credits, individuals who were previously employed can access the scheme in the same manner as other workers, subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme.

There are currently more than\u00a030,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and\u00a0over 20,000 landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments. HAP is a flexible and immediate form of social housing support that is available to all eligible households across the State. A summary of the household classes supported by the HAP scheme at the end of Q3 2017 is set out below, which indicates that single and single sharing households are able to access accommodation suitable to their needs in the private rented market via HAP:<\/p>  <p>  -  Single\/ Single Sharing - 30%<\/p>  <p>  -  Couple\/ Couple Sharing - 4%<\/p>  <p>  -  Lone Parent with Children - 40%<\/p>  <p>  -  Couple with Children - 26%<\/p>  <p>  The increased rent limits introduced by this Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing \u00a0HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords. \u00a0Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork City regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP. <\/p>  <p>  From available data, at the end of Q3 2017, approximately 20% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits. When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 14.4% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.9% above rent limits provided.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016,\u00a0recommended the introduction of a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising - where households have greatest difficulties in finding accommodation they can afford.\u00a0The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for the Rent Predictability Measure and\u00a0for areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents\u00a0can now\u00a0only rise by a maximum of 4% annually for a period of\u00a0three years.<\/p>  <p>  This measure was implemented immediately in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork City as these areas already met the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone in December 2016. A further 12 Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) were designated in January 2017, with the measure further extended to Maynooth and Cobh LEAs in March 2017 and to Drogheda and Greystones LEAs in September 2017.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I\u00a0are constantly monitoring HAP data, as well as\u00a0other key information relating to the private rental market.\u00a0Indications are that the current HAP\u00a0rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs. Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. Based on the data outlined above, I am currently satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to meet the demand of the rental market in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.\u00a0My Department will, of course,\u00a0continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700094#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homelessness Strategy","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700094#WRY01900"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[52471\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017120700094#WRY02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a statistical analysis has been carried out on the number of occasions adults are presenting to support organisations (details supplied); the number of these persons noted as accessing or needing wrap around services; the way in which this is recorded; the strategic planning undertaken to deal with identified growing demand; the department or organisation taking the lead on collating such data; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities.\u00a0For the purposes of funding under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 and the delivery and coordination of services, lead authorities are in place in nine regions countrywide.\u00a0 Housing authorities operate the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), which records details in relation to persons presenting to homeless services, and the various services that are provided to them.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In the Dublin Region, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) operates across the four housing authorities as a shared service, which includes the Central Placement Service.\u00a0 It is a matter for the relevant housing authorities and the DRHE to identify and liaise as necessary with other State agencies and NGO service providers on services and supports required.\u00a0 Such information and details are recorded by them on PASS and, given the confidential nature of this information and data protection requirements, such information is not shared with my Department. <\/p><p>My Department's role with respect to Threshold is limited to providing funding for their research work.

Furthermore, I recently established a new Homelessness Inter-Agency Group, chaired by a former Secretary General, to examine how homeless services might be delivered in a more coherent and joined-up way across the various Government departments and agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy on homelessness recognises the provision of long-term secure housing, with support as needed to ensure sustainable tenancies, as the key solution to ending homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  While all homeless people have a need for stable housing, homelessness is a complex issue and a variety of other supports and interventions can be required to meet individual needs.  Indeed,\u00a0many homeless persons, in particular those engaged in rough sleeping, have complex health and social care needs, including in relation to addiction and mental health issues, that require care and supports beyond the simple provision of accommodation via the housing authority.  Consequently a multi-agency approach is considered necessary to successfully address rough sleeping. The work of the new Homeless Inter-Agency Group, which I established, will be key in supporting this approach.<\/p>  <p>  Housing-led initiatives are critical in this regard, providing direct access to housing and to the intensive health, addiction and personal supports required for people who are homeless and have complex needs to maintain their tenancies.  Arising from\u00a0last September&rsquo;s Housing Summit, I indicated that a\u00a0National Director of Housing First, with specialist expertise, would be appointed and that the housing first approach would be expanded beyond Dublin to the other main urban areas.

This records the number of households on all local authority waiting lists, as at 21 September 2016.  The results\u00a0show that there were 91,600 households deemed qualified for, and in need of social housing support.  39% of all households qualified for social housing support are in the four Dublin Housing Authorities, over half (56%) of whom are in the Dublin City\u00a0Council area.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under Rebuilding Ireland, a total of 50,000 new social housing homes will\u00a0be delivered\u00a0out to 2021 and an additional 80,000 new households will be supported under the Housing Assistance Payment scheme.  These tenancies will support and meet the needs of households\u00a0on waiting lists\u00a0across the country, including Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is encouraging the use of rapid build methodologies, including modular build,\u00a0for accelerated delivery of social housing units generally.  The question of utilising rapid build methodologies and other innovative construction technologies, including modular\u00a0is,\u00a0ultimately,\u00a0a matter for\u00a0consideration by each local authority and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB's) in the context of individual projects.  Utilising innovative construction technologies can accelerate housing provision, as\u00a0timeframes are considerably less than for traditional build.<\/p>  <p>  In December last year, the Government introduced limits on rent increases in designated Rent Pressure Zones, those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising fastest.  The measure was introduced to slow the increase in rents which is a significant driver of increasing homelessness.  The coverage of the Rent Pressure Zones is substantial.  Nearly 57% of all registered rental properties, involving approximately 180,000 tenancies, are currently in designated areas.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we will shortly introduce the requirement for landlords to notify the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) when issuing a notice terminating a tenancy.

Commencement notices\u00a0are up\u00a0by 37%, with notices for 17,151 new homes nationwide submitted in the year\u00a0to end- October. Estimates from most economic and property commentators suggest that over 18,000 new homes will be built this year, a substantial increase on the 2016 figure of around 15,000 new homes.  Clearly, all relevant indicators &ndash; including planning permissions, construction commencement notices and connections to the ESB grid - are showing very significant upward trends in home-building activity.<\/p>  <p>  While my\u00a0Department publishes data on total housing commencements, it does\u00a0not\u00a0break these down\u00a0into\u00a0local authority build and non-local authority build.  With particular regard to the needs of those on\u00a0housing waiting lists, including those in the greater Dublin area,\u00a0under Rebuilding Ireland, 50,000 social housing homes will be delivered\u00a0through build, rapid build, refurbishment, acquisition and leasing over the period 2016 to 2021, alongside\u00a0an accelerated roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme to meet the\u00a0needs of some 80,000 households.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious challenges we face in terms of housing, the Government has prioritised the development and implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  There is already strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating housing\u00a0supply in\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0is yielding results.  In 2016, the housing needs of over 19,000 households\u00a0were met through a range of social housing programmes, supported by expenditure of over &euro;935 million.  A further &euro;1.4 billion is being\u00a0provided in 2017, to\u00a0meet the housing needs of 21,000\u00a0households, a target which I am confident will be exceeded.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has put in place new targeted timelines for social housing construction projects that set out the optimum timeframe from initial project concept through to design, planning, procurement and mobilisation of contractor on site.  The programme puts an onus on all stakeholders to advance projects through the process in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage actively with all local authorities, including all four Dublin authorities, to deliver social housing through all available avenues, with a particular emphasis on additional construction projects.
