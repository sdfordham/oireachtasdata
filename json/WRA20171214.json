The Deputy may be referring to a recommendation made as part of the recent IMF PIMA report, to the effect that appraisals should be published on a more systematic basis.<\/p>  <p>  The National Development Finance Agency was established in 2003 under the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002.  The role of the NDFA is to advise State Authorities on the optimum means of financing public investment projects in order to achieve value for money and to provide advice in relation to all aspects of financing, refinancing and insurance, including risk analysis, of public investment projects.  All PPP projects involving the use of private finance must be referred to the NDFA.  In addition, all projects valued at &euro;20 million or above, whether traditional or PPP, must be referred to the NDFA for advice.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) mission to Ireland was undertaken by the IMF in July this year.  The final report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.per.gov.ie) on 10 November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The report and its recommendations are the work of an expert team from the IMF who were invited to assess our public investment institutions to evaluate the design and effectiveness of the institutions that shape decision-making at the three key stages of the public investment cycle:<\/p>  <p>  - planning investment; <\/p>  <p>  - allocating investment to the right sectors; and<\/p>  <p>  - implementing investment. <\/p>  <p>  The PIMA report concluded that, overall, Ireland manages its public infrastructure relatively well.  It highlights both strengths and weaknesses and contains a number of recommendations to improve future performance in terms of the efficiency of public capital investment. <\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations in the PIMA report is for the publication of the results of cost-benefit analysis on Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, and the criteria used to select them.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, PPPs are subjected to the same robust and rigorous project appraisal process as traditionally procured projects.  In ensuring Departments obtain the best value-for-money from public capital investment PPPs, just as traditionally procured projects, are subject to the requirements contained in the Public Spending Code.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code encompasses guidance on a variety of issues related to the management of expenditure at each stage of the expenditure lifecycle.  This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies including cost benefit analysis. This methodological guidance aims to enhance consistency across sectors through common approaches and the use of key technical parameter values needed for quantifying costs and conducting economic appraisals.<\/p>  <p>  While there is already significant guidance and data published on PPPs I acknowledge that the publication of cost-benefit analysis on PPP projects would provide greater transparency in reporting on PPP projects.  However, in assessing the implementation of the PIMA recommendation, it would be important to take into account the commercial sensitivity of specific data included in the appraisal of PPPs.  <\/p>  <p>  An inter-Departmental and Agency Group was established earlier this year to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs, in the context of the new 10 year capital plan.  The group comprises relevant officials from the Departments and agencies with experience of procuring projects by PPP.  As part of its work, the group is considering the recommendations made in the PIMA report that relate to PPPs, including the recommendation in relation to publication of CBAs for PPP projects, to inform future decision-making on these matters.  I expect the Group's deliberations to be completed alongside the finalisation of the new 10-year capital plan, which is currently being developed by my Department to support the implementation of the Ireland 2040 Plan detailing the new National Planning Framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400068#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400068#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[53246\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400068#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to improve the gender balance on each of the State boards under his remit.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Each Minister is ultimately responsible for appointments to boards under their aegis and must have regard to the <i>Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards<\/i>.  Relevant issues relating to the effective operation of each board, including those such as diversity, gender balance and mix of expertise and skill sets are for each Minister to consider. <\/p><p>As set out in the Guidelines, compliance with the Government Decision of 23 July 2014 on Gender Balance on State Boards is an essential requirement. <\/p><p>These requirements include:<\/p><p>- Each Department should prepare a plan to reaffirm and achieve the target of at least 40% for representation of each gender on State Boards within its remit during the lifetime of the present Government. <\/p><p>- Departments should maintain a particular focus on those Boards on which either women or men are currently significantly under-represented and should actively seek to appoint candidates of the under-represented gender from the PAS short list.  <\/p><p>- Departments should in the case of Boards which have already achieved the 40% target seek to move towards 45% of each gender as a new target for gender equality.  <\/p><p>Indications are that 48% of State boards have reached the target of a minimum of 40% female membership set by the Government and indeed that some 35% of boards have met the higher 45% target.  This compares very favourably with the private sector, with a figure of somewhere around 13% female participation.  The position on individual State boards is a matter for the relevant Minister.<\/p><p>Up to the end of September this year, over 500 appointments have been made under the new system.  Some 30% of over 8,700 applications received for state board appointment came from women, who made up some 45% of the appointments made. <\/p><p>The Board of the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is the only State Board under the aegis of my Department.  The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, which established PAS, specifies that the chairperson and ordinary members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in consultation with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  <\/p><p>The Act also specifies that in appointing persons as members of the Board the Minister shall ensure that:<\/p><p>- at least 2 of them have either or both  civil service and other public service experience and knowledge which the Minister considers relevant, and<\/p><p>- at least 2 of them have expertise in human resource management, customer service and recruitment outside the public service which the Minister considers relevant.<\/p><p>Up until recently, five of the nine members (or 55%) were women, including the 3 positions recruited through the State Board process operated by PAS.  However, two of these three positions are currently vacant but are in the process of being filled through the PAS process and the issue of gender balance will be considered along with other issues.  There is also a third vacancy which is normally filled following a recommendation from the Minister for Justice and Equality. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400068#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 9 to 14, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Expenditure Reviews","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400068#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[53247\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400068#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the rolling selective spending review process which will take place in his Department between 2017 and 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>As part of my Estimates speech on Budget day last year I announced that a spending review would take place on a three-year rolling basis. <\/p>  <p>  The first cycle of the Spending Review in 2017, which culminated in the publication of over 20 analytical papers on Spending Review topics, was successfully completed in October following the publication of Budget 2018.

This entails the construction of flood defences, consisting of embankments and walls. The OPW has consulted with communities in Mountmellick and Portarlington to ensure their knowledge, views and concerns in relation to flood risk are taken on board.  There was an extensive response to the public consultation on the draft Flood Plans and constructive and wide-ranging observations were provided.<\/p><p>The Government has agreed an increased allocation of funding for flood relief activities totalling &euro;430m in its Capital Investment Plan for the period 2016-2021 with the annual budget allocation rising from &euro;45m to &euro;100m by 2021.

Also, based on existing retirement behaviour of public servants, it would be expected that as these employees will be in a position to retire on pension from age 65, there will be a continuing trend towards retirement over subsequent years.

Ireland and its EU partners have called for concrete action to ensure the full respect and independence of Venezuela&rsquo;s democratic institutions, notably through the holding of free and fair elections supervised by a balanced Electoral Council and involving independent international observation. <\/p>  <p>  On 13 November last, at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, which I attended, it was agreed unanimously to adopt restrictive measures, underscoring our concerns at the situation in the country.  These measures consist of an embargo on arms and on related material that might be used for internal repression, as well as a legal framework for a travel ban and assets freeze.  The measures are designed to be scaled up or down on a gradual basis to respond to developments in Venezuela, of which respect for the electoral timetable and process will represent an important barometer.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely in concert with our European partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400069#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400069#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[53974\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400069#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the estimated number of Irish persons living in the United States of America without documentation; the recent efforts that have been made to resolve this issue; the number of meetings held; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>I want first of all to reassure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to finding a solution to the plight of the thousands of undocumented Irish in the United States.<\/p><p>By their nature, it is difficult to put exact numbers on undocumented communities, and the thousands of undocumented Irish in the US are no different.

We also want to see transition arrangements which preserve the status quo in terms of British rights and obligations, other than in relation to membership of the EU institutions and agencies.  They should be in place for a period long enough to allow for an orderly Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  It will also be important to maintain a clear focus on the unique challenges faced by Ireland.  All aspects of the Irish specific issues will continue to be worked on in a distinct stream of work in phase 2.  The EU27, including Ireland, will therefore need to be satisfied that the principles and commitments agreed on Friday are delivered upon and reflected in the withdrawal agreement. <\/p>  <p>  There is no question that Brexit poses very significant and serious challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and trade, as well as across a range of other sectors.  While in recent years we have been diversifying increasingly to other markets, Ireland is still heavily reliant on the UK as a trading partner.  A number of key sectors will also be impacted significantly, including, but not limited to, agri-food, fisheries, financial services, transport, energy, enterprise and trade more generally.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Ireland&rsquo;s approach to phase two of the negotiations will continue to be informed by the detailed sectoral work being done by individual Departments, and through cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department.  These represent a very active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit, including its priorities for the next phase of the Article 50 negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Since taking up office, engagement on Brexit with Michel Barnier and his Taskforce, and with other EU partners, has been a central element of my work and that of my Department and our Missions.  This approach has yielded clear results in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by our EU27 partners and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position and the outcome of Phase 1.  As the negotiations move to a new phase in 2018, we will continue working closely with the Commission Task Force to advance Irish priorities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400069#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":115,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered with Question No. 41.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400069#WRB05000"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[54136\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400069#WRB05100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has raised the EU Ombudsman report on unpaid internships in the European External Action Service with his EU colleagues; if he will recommend action on the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>As I noted in my response to the Deputy regarding this matter on 13 July 2017, the EU Ombudsman report on unpaid internships in the European External Action Service is an &ldquo;own initiative&rdquo; report that has not been the subject of formal discussion among EU foreign ministers.

A small number of invoices for photography at events held during 2017 have yet to be received.

Expenditure has, however, arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  The information requested by the Deputy in this area is set out in Table 2.<\/p><p>DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations. <\/p><p>The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year, including the annual SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities: <\/p><p>- Convening national and regional information workshops;<\/p><p>- Managing and administering the application process;<\/p><p>- Organising the judging process<\/p><p>- Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;<\/p><p>- Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;<\/p><p>- Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.<\/p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.<\/p><p>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR has also been engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin.  This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<\/p><p>Africa Day events have been hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in George&rsquo;s Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate annually since 2013. In 2011, the Department supported a series of smaller-scale performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event.<\/p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below. This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.<\/p><p>DHR also previously provided

This is a service which my Department provides so that the media can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated.  Events such as the visit of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in May 2017 and those by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in July 2017 and UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in November 2017 resulted in positive overseas media coverage of Ireland.  <\/p><p>Through the Office of Government Procurement an updated Multi-Supplier Framework Agreement for the provision of Professional Photography and Videography is now in operation.

Local public banks in Germany are called Sparkassen.  They are only permitted to operate in specific geographic regions.

Additionally, the business model of Sparkassen involves building close relationships with local SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process with stakeholders and interested parties.  There has also been analysis of a detailed proposal on the Sparkassen model and its possible implementation in Ireland.

Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions.  All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. <\/p>  <p>  The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended in 2014.  The additional levy of 0.15% which my predecessor introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, also ended in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate. <\/p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.\u00a0 It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.  In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.\u00a0 Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme.  The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will benefit from the changes which my predecessor began in Budget 2015 and which have continued in subsequent Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400070#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Data","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400070#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[53732\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400070#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 74 of 30 November 2017, if the figures given for net fiscal space for 2019, 2020 and 2021 include the changes announced in budget 2018;

SES 2016 also presented an indicative split between expenditure and taxation uses of these amounts as well as the provision for contributions to the Rainy Day Fund (RDF).  This was subsequently updated in the\u00a0SES 2017\u00a0to take account of the decision to increase capital expenditure in 2019, 2020 and 2021 by &euro;500m by reducing the planned contributions to the RDF by the same amount.  The figures given were adjusted to take into account the arithmetic set out in the Budget 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The current forecasts of general government revenue and expenditure include this allocation of fiscal space along with the measures introduced in\u00a0Budget 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The detailed estimates of gross and net fiscal space updated in SES 2017 resulted in additional unallocated fiscal space in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021, which was described as the margin of compliance.  Based on Budget 2018 forecasts, indications are that the margin is expected to increase when the estimates of fiscal space are updated in the SES\u00a02018\u00a0following the publication by the European Commission, in May of next year, of the reference rate, convergence margin and GDP deflator to be used for the calculations in relation to 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Net fiscal space also takes account of discretionary revenue measures that increase or decrease general government revenue such as, for example, mortgage interest relief.  Further, the additional revenue generated from a political decision not to proceed with indexation of the tax bands is included in the discretionary revenue measures.  The amounts set out in my previous response are inclusive of these.<\/p>  <p>  Before addressing the specific issues raised, I want to stress the importance of the fiscal stance rather than the fiscal space.  The economy is performing very strongly at present and full employment is now within sight.  In these circumstances, it would be completely inappropriate to adopt pro-cyclical budgetary policies that simply add fuel to the fire.  So, regardless of what fiscal space is available, it is my intention to do what is correct for the economy and I will not repeat the mistakes of the past. \u00a0Steady, sustainable improvements in public services are what is required, not boom and bust.<\/p>  <p>  Now, turning to specific issues.<\/p>  <p>  Changes announced in Budget 2018 that are recognised in 2018 go into the expenditure and revenue base and have no further effect on fiscal space.  However, as set out in Table 7 of the\u00a0Expenditure Report 2018, the carryover impact of\u00a0Budget 2018\u00a0measures is estimated at approximately &euro;192 million.  These costs would have to come out of the unallocated fiscal space in the 2019 forecasts.  Tax carryover is &euro;14m and would need to be met out of the &euro;590m fiscal space available for tax reductions in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) has been ratified and the costs are included in the forecasts.  The amounts are &euro;370m in 2019, &euro;340m in 2020, and &euro;230m in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The tapering of mortgage interest relief (MIR), decided in Budget 2018, results in a revenue yield to the Exchequer that represents a positive discretionary revenue measure, increasing fiscal space, of &euro;46m in 2019, &euro;41m in 2020, and &euro;37m in 2021.  This is already included in the tax revenue forecasts.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The existing forecasts make provision for tax reductions of &euro;590 million, &euro;620 million and &euro;610 million for 2019 &ndash; 2021 respectively. <\/p>  <p>  If a decision is taken to index the income tax bands then the revenue reductions included in the forecasts could be utilised for this purpose without impacting the tax forecasts for fiscal space. If social welfare payments were to be indexed then the unallocated fiscal space within the current forecasts could be utilised in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  The capital envelope is included in the baseline forecasts.  As such, when calculating fiscal space, the provision for smoothing of gross fixed capital formation applies.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s planned expenditure as per its 2015 business plan was incorporated in the general government forecasts for 2015-2021.  The reform of the funding of Irish Water due to the\u00a0Water Services Act 2017\u00a0is neutral in overall general government terms and thus has no impact on calculations of fiscal space in the years 2019 &ndash; 2021. Further details on these changes were set out in chapter 7 of the\u00a0Economic and Fiscal Outlook\u00a0document as part of\u00a0Budget 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The baseline forecasts include demographic effects.  These amount to &euro;500m in 2019, &euro;480m in 2020, and &euro;480m in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Local Property Tax (LPT), this policy is not settled and the revaluation date has been postponed to 2019. \u00a0The position in 2019 and beyond is a matter of active consideration by Government.\u00a0 In that context, my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners will consider issues relating to the implementation of the recommendations in the Report prepared by Dr Don Thornhill.\u00a0 The Government will make its position clear so that households will know well in advance what its plans are for LPT. In that regard, the forecast for LPT as set out in Budget 2018 of &euro;470 million for 2017 remains unchanged over the forecast horizon.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, there are no discretionary revenue measures relating to LPT policy changes in 2018 and no assumptions can be made in this regard for 2019 and subsequent years until the policy process described above is completed.\u00a0 Accordingly, the impact of potential LPT changes on the forecasts of fiscal space out to 2021 is not included. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400070#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Claims Agency Data","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400070#WRC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[53740\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400070#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number and value of claims paid out by the State Claims Agency in each the past five years; the number and value of claims that were settled out of court; the number and value of claims settled as a result of a court decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the NTMA is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims management and risk management functions designated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990, as amended. <\/p><p>In answer to the Deputy's question, I refer to material provided by the SCA and which is outlined in the tables.

In some respects, it broadened the category of companies who are eligible while in others it narrowed it; it introduced the requirement to consider all associated companies rather than the applicant company on a stand-alone basis; it introduced the requirement that relief under EII is only given for investments made on foot of a viable business plan and that follow-on investments are only eligible for relief where they were foreseen in the business plan first used to raise EII supported financing.

The Agency announced in October that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State.  However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of this primary and important objective, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA.  Subject to current market conditions prevailing, this includes redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s subordinated debt of &euro;1.6 billion by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.  Successful completion of these major NAMA objectives will produce a significant economic and social contribution to the State, by addressing supply shortages. <\/p>  <p>  I would also refer the Deputy to the announcement in my Budget statement in October of the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), which is intended to increase the availability of debt funding on market terms to commercially viable residential development projects.

To assist insurance companies to take into account the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence schemes, the OPW has a Memorandum of Understanding with Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry. This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on these completed schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding. Insurance Ireland members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these protected areas. To date OPW has provided details to Insurance Ireland on 18 completed schemes nationally and Insurance Ireland surveys its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in these areas. <\/p>  <p>  The insurance industry has recently confirmed that it accepts that flood defence schemes that utilise demountable defences provide protection against 1 in 100 year flood events. The insurance industry however do have concerns in relation to the human element in the deployment of these demountable defences, specifically in relation to any liability for flooding arising due to the incorrect or late installation of the defences. A separate working group including members of Insurance Ireland the Department of Finance and the OPW are discussing how best to address these concerns. This group last met on November 13th and is scheduled to meet again in January. <\/p>  <p>  These meetings are in addition to the regular quarterly meetings where the OPW and the Department of Finance engage with Insurance Ireland in respect of the Memorandum of Understanding. The most recent of these meetings took place on December 8th 2017 with the next meeting scheduled for March 2018.

As non public servants, the staff of such organisations, which may exceed 100,000 in number, did not, for example, fall within the application of the FEMPI legislation involving as it did the reduction in pay and increase in pension contribution for public servants.

While it is the case that certain or indeed, in some cases, all of these financial resources may come from government funding it remains the position that decisions on pay expenditure issues arising in such entities are matters that are determined at the discretion of the management authorities of each of the organisations concerned. The issue of pay is just one important challenge within a complex mix of other challenges and demands that the individual organisations concerned are required to decide upon and manage.  Having regard therefore to these circumstances it is a matter for each of these private sector organisations to resolve the financial challenges that they may face in accordance with the financial resources available to them, whatever the source may be of such funding arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that in respect of Section 39 organisations, which are private sector concerns and a significant part of this sector, funding of almost &euro;1billion was provided by the State in 2016.

The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service facilitated amongst other things suppliers charging different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services.  This was not sustainable, as the State could not afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermines the efficient delivery of services.<\/p><p>The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have been designed to optimise benefits including savings to the State through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.

circulars\u00a0to support and strengthen schools&rsquo; efforts in developing in young people the skills and attitudes needed to make informed decisions about their health.<\/p>  <p>  Schools and the wider education sector in conjunction with parents and families have a crucial role to play in supporting students to make healthy choices.  Through their primary and post primary education students are taught the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make healthier life choices and to develop the resilience to reject negative options.  This can be seen across in the curriculum, through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  It is also an important component of Wellbeing, the new area of learning introduced to all first year students from September 2017, as part of\u00a0the implementation of the new Framework for Junior Cycle. <\/p>  <p>  Another significant development in this area is the introduction of the specification for a new examinable Leaving Certificate Physical Education subject and a new non-examinable Framework for Senior Cycle Physical Education which were approved by me in February 2017, following development by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). <\/p>  <p>  Both the examinable subject and the Framework are being introduced on a phased basis from September 2018 . This is in keeping with the strong emphasis from my Department on promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for all students and commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government and the National Physical Activity Plan, reflecting the concern to ensure that all young persons in our schools engage in some form of physical activity.  The work\u00a0in schools\u00a0also supports the Government's Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025 - Healthy Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Lifeskills Survey indicates that 92% of primary schools surveyed reported that they had a healthy eating policy in place.  This is similar to the level reported in 2012. 3% reported that they were in the process of developing a healthy eating policy, and 5% reported having no healthy eating policy in place. <\/p>  <p>  100% of primary schools reported that they taught pupils about the importance of a balanced diet and 99% include the food pyramid as part of these lessons. <\/p>  <p>  At Post primary 32% of schools reported having a healthy eating policy in place and a further 30% reported that they were in the process of developing one. 93% of schools reported that they promoted healthy lunches with their students compared with 66% in 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400075#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400075#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[53510\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400075#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding an application for new accommodation by a school (details supplied).","asker":"1232","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware,\u00a0a building project for\u00a0the school to which he refers is included in my Department's 6 Year Construction Programme.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The acquisition of a suitable site for the school's permanent accommodation has recently been completed.\u00a0 Arrangements are now being made to finalise the project brief for the school concerned with the aim of progressing the project into the\u00a0architectural planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400075#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400075#WRH02150"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[53531\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400075#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of departmental staff, by departmental premises, and within statutory bodies within his remit, and their grades, employed in Drogheda.","asker":"1333","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":436,"content":"<p>My Department has a regional office of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) based at Drogheda.

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for the Bill. The PSSA provides a framework for further negotiation on a number of issues, including new entrant pay. <\/p>  <p>  Public service agreements have already delivered on a number of issues through structured negotiations and engagement with concerned groups. Through this process a 15-22% pay increase was negotiated for new teachers. The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs. In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. These benefits were achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining. <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases\u00a0that\u00a0have been negotiated would mean I would have had less money available to hire\u00a0over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. An initial meeting on new entrant pay under this process took place on 12 October 2017.

","asker":"1370","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":505,"content":"<p>I should point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates. <\/p>  <p>  Inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates for childcare and education facilities and calls to exempt all such providers were among the issues raised at a number of stages during the passage of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015. As a result, the Government approved an amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis. This extension of the childcare and education exemption removed an anomaly that previously existed where those that provided childcare and education on a charitable basis were exempt but those that did so on a not-for-profit basis were not.  <\/p>  <p>  The decision taken by Government in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 to extend the exemption from rates for early childcare and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in Oireachtas debates during the passage of the legislation, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable. There is a variety of other more appropriate means through which Government can and does support the provision of such services. Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the exemption of those that provide childcare and early education on a not-for-profit basis, paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 also exempts from rates childcare facilities that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4. As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the payment of rates by individual ratepayers, the Deputy will be aware that under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Valuation Office multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of the local authority. The latter is a reserved function of the elected members and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) was consulted in the deliberations surrounding the extension of the exemption from rates for early childcare and education. Private childcare facilities which are operated for profit form part of the rateable valuation base on a nationwide basis. While I understand that this issue has been the subject of discussions earlier this year between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and my own Department, there are currently no plans to provide for special treatment of these for profit facilities by their exemption from rateability under the Valuation Acts.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I should point out that there are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation, pursuant to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities. The principle of local authorities levying rates based on an independent valuation is well established, and I understand that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has indicated that there are no plans to change this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK01750"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[54181\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to reports that the Government is seeking to delay the implementation of European Union Work-Life Balance Directive; his views on the fact that Ireland is one of only six EU member states to not offer employer paid paternity leave; his plans to address this anomaly in respect of the implementation of the directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[53952\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans in respect of the implementation of the European Union Work Life Balance Directive; his views on the fact that Ireland is one of only six EU member states to not offer employer paid parental leave; his plans to address this anomaly in respect of the implementation of the directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 218 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, on 26 April 2017, the European Commission initiated a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on work-life balance for parents and carers and repealing Council Directive 2010\/18\/EU.  The Directive is part of a package of measures aimed, inter alia, at addressing the underrepresentation of women in employment, and supporting women&rsquo;s career progression by creating improved conditions whereby they can reconcile their working responsibilities and family commitments. <\/p>  <p>  The specific objectives of the Directive are (1) To improve access to work-life balance arrangements and (2) To increase take-up of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements by men. <\/p>  <p>  The key articles in the Directive are (1) Article 4, which provides for 10 days of paid paternity leave, (2) Article 5, which provides for four months parental leave, one month of which may be transferable between parents, in respect of children up to the age of eight, (3) Article 6, which provides for five days per annum paid carers&rsquo; leave, (4) Article 8, which provides that workers exercising rights in accordance with articles 4, 5 and 6 will receive payment or an allowance equivalent to national sick leave rates (at a minimum) and (5) Article 9, which provides for the right of a worker with caring responsibilities or the right of a parent (in respect of children up to 12 years of age) to ask his or her employer for flexible working arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Working Group negotiations on the proposed directive have been underway since the initiation of the proposal, and will continue in January 2018 under the Bulgarian Presidency of the European Union.  It is expected that discussions on the Directive will not progress to general approach for at least several months so it would be premature to plan for the proposal&rsquo;s implementation at this stage. <\/p>  <p>  While supportive of the aims of the Directive, in common with many other member states Ireland recognises that there are significant cost implications associated with the proposed new Parental Leave scheme. These reservations have been expressed at working group level and also at the meeting of the Council of the European Union on Employment, Social Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) on 7 December, 2017.  At that meeting the implementation of the Parental Leave scheme on a phased basis was suggested and discussed.  Given the cost implications and logistical issues arising, this is a reasonable position to adopt as it would allow member states to reduce the initial costs of introducing any new leave and benefit arrangements over a period of time and it would also give member states sufficient time to manage the logistics of any new schemes.  The Government is of the view that were the principle of phased implementation to be accepted, the focus should initially be on providing leave to parents of younger children and only subsequently expanded to parents of older children.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the goals of the proposed directive are already reflected in existing schemes in Ireland. For instance in 2016 a new scheme of two weeks of Paternity Leave to paid at the sick leave rate was introduced which satisfies the requirements of the proposed Directive in relation to paternity leave. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to expanding paid leave for the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, and work on developing proposals on how this expansion can be best achieved will formally begin in early 2018.  It is expected that the agreed scheme will be recognised as progress towards achieving the requirements of the Directive. <\/p>  <p>  My Department looks forward to continuing work on the Directive with the other key Government Departments and the EU Commission, Presidency and member states to shape it so that it is affordable, properly targeted, and effectively serves to improve the work life balance of parents and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":510,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[53533\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of departmental staff by departmental premises and within statutory bodies within his remit and their grades employed in Drogheda.","asker":"1333","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":512,"content":"<p>The table sets out the information requested by the Deputy.<table><tr><th>Offices of the Department and Statutory Bodies under the remit of the Minister based in Drogheda<\/th><th>Number of Officers<\/th><th>Grade\/Rank<\/th><th>Premises\/Address<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>Probation Officer<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>Clerical Officer<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Probation Service, Department of Justice and Equality<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>Community Service Supervisor<\/td><td>23 Laurence Street, Drogheda, Co.

The offence is punishable by summary conviction to a Class A fine or a term of imprisonment of 12 months or both. <\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court judgment in the case of N.V.H. v. The Minister for Justice and Equality found, on 30 May last, that in an international protection system with no temporal limits as to when the application process will be concluded, an absolute prohibition on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.  The Court recognised that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months. The Court in making its Final Orders agreed to a stay on the execution of the Order until 9 February 2018. My officials are actively engaged in ensuring compliance with the Order. <\/p>  <p>  Following the approval of Government, an Inter-Departmental Taskforce was established in July to examine the wide-ranging implications of the judgment, and to consider appropriate solutions.  The Taskforce was comprised of representatives from nine Government Departments, along with the Office of the Attorney General.  On 21 November 2017, the Government approved the recommendations of the Taskforce, including the key recommendation that the State should respond to the judgment by opting-in to the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive (2013\/33\/EU).  The EU Directive provides for many matters including, of course, access to the labour market for international protection applicants.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice will move the required Motions to seek approval in the Houses of the Oireachtas for participation in the Directive at the earliest opportunity. Following the approval of both Houses, the opt-in procedure with formal notifications to the European Council and the European Commission will commence. The European Commission then has four months from receipt of this letter to confirm our participation.  During these four months, the State will be required to demonstrate to the Commission how it is compliant with each Article in the Directive. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has agreed to establish an Implementation Group to oversee the opt-in procedure and the practical arrangements for facilitating access to the labour market for eligible applicants. The Group will be drawn from membership of the Taskforce, supplemented by the participation of relevant operational areas in the Department of Justice and Equality and other Departments as required. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to access to further and higher education, a Pilot Support Scheme was introduced by the Department of Education and Skills in 2015 for students who are in the Protection System or at the Leave to Remain (but not deportation order) stage. This was one of the recommendations contained in the report by the Working Group on the Protection Process which was chaired by former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon. The scheme provides supports to qualifying students which are similar to those available in the Student Grant Scheme. Following a review of the Pilot Support Scheme in 2016, a decision was made to continue the scheme for the 2017\/18 academic year and to undertake a further review in 2018.  To qualify for the pilot scheme, prospective students have to meet a number of criteria, including a requirement to:<\/p>  <p>  - Meet the definition of a protection applicant or a person at leave to remain stage (other than those at the deportation order stage);<\/p>  <p>  - Obtained their Leaving Certificate;<\/p>  <p>  - Have been accepted on an approved Post Leaving Certificate course or an approved undergraduate course;<\/p>  <p>- Have attended a minimum of five academic years in the Irish school system and have been part of an application for protection or leave to remain for a combined period of 5 years prior to the 31st   of August of the first year of their course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[53553\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400077#WRK02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current and-or expected residency status in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, in response to a notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), written representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned. <\/p>  <p>  These representations, together with all other information and documentation on file, will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and all other applicable legislation, in advance of a final decision being made.   <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Further consideration was also given to the inevitability of legal challenges to such action, the passage of time, and associated retirements, and poor data quality, which would all have additional delay, cost or other implications.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner informed the Authority that the decision to take a future-focused, restorative approach allowed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to focus on strategic reforms, changes to culture and embedding the Code of Ethics and performance management system, along with improving data quality. <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner also confirmed that he will be issuing a personal directive to all members stating that distortion of data quality and data breaches will amount to a serious disciplinary matter and could, at the most serious level, result in dismissal. In addition, the Commissioner indicated that he would be specifically and individually writing to each Divisional manager to highlight their responsibilities in relation to supervision and accountability. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Policing Authority to ensure oversight of policing practices, shed light on problems and identify solutions through its structured engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Policing Authority's commentary on the Crowe Horwath report, where the Authority, in relation to this point, stated that \"poor performance on a pervasive scale can seldom be appropriately addressed by disciplinary processes\". The Authority further commented that the focus should be on implementing a meaningful performance management system for both Garda members and civilians in 2018, so that there is a framework for the delivery of policing plans and ensuring accountability.<\/p>  <p>  The Authority went on to indicate that, unless there is prima facie evidence of either a criminal offence or a disciplinary breach having been committed, the core focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should now be on rectifying the issues identified permanently across all dimensions, including procedures, technology, training, supervision and accountability.  I fully expect the Commissioner to urgently address the issues highlighted by myself, by Crowe Horwath and by the Policing Authority and I welcome the continuing  oversight of the Policing Authority in this respect. This Government has put in place significant Garda resources, both human and financial, but, as the Policing Authority has emphasised, cultural change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of critical importance.  This is why one of the Policing Authority&rsquo;s first acts was to introduce a Garda Code of Ethics. Adherence to that code must become a fundamental part of our policing.  I previously made clear to Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in that Garda management must ensure that all members are committed to the values the Code sets out. I am confident that he and his colleagues understand the importance of ensuring that cultural change goes hand in hand with systemic improvements.  The Policing Authority has a critical role to play in supporting and overseeing this process. Moreover, it is important to remember that the expert Commission on the Future of Policing is undertaking a significant root and branch analysis of policing in Ireland.  I have no doubt that this report will inform the Commission's work to bring about the transformation of policing in this country. However, I fully acknowledge the vital work undertaken everyday by the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the safety and security of the people of Ireland. I remain dedicated to doing everything in my power as Minister, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to ensure ethical and excellent policing, robust oversight and the modernisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure it can operate effectively and professionally in the public interest.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would draw the Deputy's attention to page 33 of Crowe Horwath's report, which contains a table, outlining the regional and divisional discrepancies in breath test data across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the period June 2009 to April 2017. Statistical information is also available in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's internal examination into the recording of breath tests at MATs, published in September this year (Pages 52-55 refer).   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400078#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400078#WRL01150"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[53917\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400078#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current and-or expected residency status in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>I refer to my previous response to the Deputy on 28 September, 2017 in relation to this issue.I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that INIS has no record of correspondence since then in relation to the person's current circumstances.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers taking account of projected retirements, will increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>  I am also pleased that Budget 2018 maintains this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensures that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p><p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.<\/p><p>  As the information requested by the Deputy, which relates to the period 2010 to 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is very voluminous, I am arranging to have it forwarded in hard copy form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400080#WRN02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400081#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[54008\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400081#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the residency status in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy, who currently has permission to reside in the State until 18 March 2018, is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  A letter issued to the person concerned on 12 December 2017 requesting certain information.

It involves senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs; it also includes the Criminal Assets Bureau and UK National Crime Agency (who have the primary role in criminal assets recovery) as well as other appropriate law enforcement services (such as environmental protection agencies and immigration services) when required by the operations of the Task Force.  The establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force was a commitment of the Irish and British Governments in the 2015 <i>Fresh Start Agreement<\/i>and the Task Force has been operational since early 2016.  <\/p><p>The Joint Agency Task Force consists of a Strategic Oversight Group which identifies and manages the strategic priorities for combatting cross-jurisdictional organised crime and an Operations Co-ordination Group which co-ordinates joint operations and directs the necessary multi-agency resources for those operations.  <\/p><p>As the Joint Agency Task Force is a multi-agency coordination structure is does not have a defined staffing complement or budget.  Personnel from the participating agencies in both jurisdictions are assigned for specific operations.  Similarly, budget resources are deployed from the various elements of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other agencies as necessary for particular operational requirements.<\/p><p>I am very satisfied with the operation of the Joint Agency Task Force in the two years since its inception.  There have, for example, been specific operations targeting rural crime, child sexual exploitation and human trafficking for labour exploitation that have resulted in a number of arrests, the seizure of stolen vehicles, equipment and other goods, cash and drugs and the identification by the Revenue services of unregistered business interests.  In respect of rural crime, there was also a specific focus on awareness-raising and providing crime prevention advice at community level on both sides of the border.  <\/p><p>The Joint Agency Task Force is just one example of the extensive co-operation that is undertaken between police and criminal justice agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland.

This Strategy is a whole of Government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities both in a practical sense, and also in creating the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential. The Strategy focuses on eight vital areas, one of which is Employment. Five high level objectives in relation to Employment are identified as follows:<\/p><p>- People with disabilities are encouraged and motivated to develop to the maximum of their potential, with a view to participating in further education and employment.<\/p><p>- People with disabilities have the opportunity to work and have a career.<\/p><p>- People who become disabled are given the supports they need to remain in or return work if they so choose.<\/p><p>- People with disabilities are financially better off in work.<\/p><p>- Employers can easily access information about employing a person with a disability.<\/p><p>These objectives are underpinned by 11 specific, measureable and time bound actions. In particular I would bring the Deputy's particular attention to Action 47, &ldquo;We will fully implement the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for persons with disabilities.&rdquo; <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy was launched in\u00a0October 2015. The Strategy sets out a ten-year cross-government\u00a0approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities. In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment. The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:<\/p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence<\/p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work<\/p><p>- Make work pay (the Make Work Pay Report was launched in April 2016 and many of its recommendations are already being implemented).<\/p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work<\/p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support<\/p><p>- Engage employers<\/p><p>The Comprehensive Employment Strategy includes a range of practical measures to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities.\u00a0 For example, a national employer helpline was launched in January 2016 to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities. There will be an increase in the public sector employment quota from 3% to 6% on a phased basis to 2024, and arrangements are also being put in place for dedicated recruitment channels for people with disabilities.<b><\/b><\/p><p>Given the complex cross-government nature of the strategy, an oversight implementation group was established in 2015\u00a0under the independent chairmanship of Fergus Finlay. This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the six strategic priorities of the strategy, ensuring that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets.

My Department through Enterprise Ireland look forward to supporting more regionally-based projects as they support business growth through this exciting, regionally-focused initiative.<\/p><p>Details of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund second call is available on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s website<i>www.enterprise-ireland.com\/REDF.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400083#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400083#WRQ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[53561\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400083#WRQ02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the Acts, or parts of Acts, awaiting commencement within her area of statutory responsibility; the reason for the delay in the commencement of each; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":678,"content":"<p>Details of Acts, or parts of Acts, for which I have responsibility and which have not been commenced, and the reasons that commencement orders have not been made, are set out in the table.<table><tr><th><div>Act\/Section of Act that has not been Commenced <\/div><\/th><th><div>Reason Commencement Order has not been made <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Legal Metrology (Measuring Instruments) Act (No. 31 of 2017) <\/td><td>The Legal Metrology (Measuring Instruments) Act 2017 was signed by the President on 28 November 2017.

The remainder of that Directive is being transposed by way of Statutory Instrument (S.I.) under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972. On the advice of the Attorney General, the Act and S.I. must come into effect on the same date. Drafting of the S.I. is virtually completed.

Section 49 provides that, where it is permissible for a trader to impose a payment charge in accordance with section 48 (i.e. where the trader accepts only one relevant method of payment or imposes the same charge in respect of all relevant methods of payment), the trader must state the price of the goods or service as a single amount inclusive of any such charge. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Companies Act 2014\u00a0Section 4(2)               Section 1325<\/td><td>Section 4(2) in so far as it relates to Regulation 6 of the EuropeanCommunities (Mergers and Divisions of Companies) (Amendment)Regulations 2011 (S.I. No.306 of 2011)\u00a0The full repeal of Regulation 6 of the European Communities (Mergers and Divisions of Companies) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 was not possible due to a difference in national law requirements on mergers concerning notice requirements and those provided for in the EU regulations on cross-border mergers.\u00a0\u00a0The reason why this section has not commenced is because it would repeal the foundation documents of the Bank of Ireland.

These definitions are for the purposes of Part 21 of the 2014 Act, which provides for &ldquo;external companies&rdquo;. An external company is a company incorporated outside of Ireland with a branch in Ireland. The main change is that the two definitions now extend to external companies registered as companies with unlimited liability but whose members&rsquo; liability is in fact limited. As a result, some unlimited companies incorporated outside of Ireland that do not qualify currently as external companies, will, once section 80 is commenced, become classified as external companies and so will be required to comply with the obligations on an external company almost. As a result, some of those companies could have had to provide financial information in respect of financial years earlier than those beginning on 1 January 2017. Under the commencement arrangements for the rest of the Act, a similarly structured company, registered in Ireland, is required to first file financial statements in respect of years that begin on or after 1 January 2017. Delay of section 80 will align the requirements for similar companies, whether registered in Ireland or not. \u00a0A revised order that will commence the section on 9 June 2018 is being prepared by the OPC.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sections 65 to 70 of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 <\/td><td>The Workplace Relations Commission was established on the 1st October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 and saw the merging of the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal into a new Body of First Instance - the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).\u00a0 The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal were incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.\u00a0Sections 65 to 70 inclusive of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 relate to the dissolution of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and cannot be commenced until the legacy caseload of the EAT has been finalised.

This standardised approach should be along the lines of South Australia Clinical guidelines for best practice management of acute and chronic Whiplash Associated Disorder. <\/p><p>The Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) scale as developed by the Quebec Task Force (QTF) is an internationally recognised objective classification scale based on severity of symptoms and associated physical signs indicative of the seriousness of the injury sustained.\u00a0 It comprises of five grades:<\/p><p>- Grade \u00a00 (WAD 0) - no neck pain, stiffness, or any physical signs are noticed<\/p><p>- Grade  1 (WAD I) - neck complaints of pain, stiffness\/tenderness but no physical signs<\/p><p>- Grade\u00a0 2 (WAD II) - neck complaints and decreased range of motion and local tenderness in the neck<\/p><p>- Grade  3 (WAD III) - neck complaints plus neurological signs <\/p><p>- Grade  4 (WAD IV) - neck complaints and fracture, dislocation, or injury to the\u00a0spinal cord.<\/p><p>The scale seeks to provide an objective basis for diagnosing whiplash.\u00a0 It allows medical practitioners to classify patients&rsquo; injuries according to their level of severity.\u00a0 This classification helps determine the type and extent of medical care patients will likely need to effectively treat the injuries and accompanying pain and discomfort.<\/p><p>The Personal Injuries Commission has included a medical reporting template in the Report to be used by all examining medical professionals in all relevant cases.<\/p><p>The Personal Injuries Commission has recognised that there are significant advantages in adopting the WAD scale in Ireland as it has been validated by research and is internationally used and recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400085#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400085#WRS02525"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[53682\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400085#WRS02550","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the timetable for the independent review of the Succeed-in-Ireland programme which her department has commissioned; if her department has assessed the projected costs of the programme to date; if not, the reason for the delay; if submissions to the public consultation will be published; and her plans to meet representatives directly from the IDA and Connect Ireland directly.","asker":"1221","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>As has been announced previously, it is intended to commission an independent review of the Succeed-in-Ireland programme.

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. <\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review. This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms. It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter. My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process. I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association  to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress. I remain hopeful to be in receipt of this legal advice before year end and  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme.

The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.

The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.  <\/p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground.  The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.<\/p><p>The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the  implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet  Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.<\/p><p>The new arrangements establish mechanisms that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and  State Agencies relevant to older people.  This includes  an annual Forum for stakeholders to identify what they consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years; and establishing clear channels of communications between stakeholders and relevant Government Departments.  In this regard, stakeholder representatives will engage with a named senior official on  issues relevant to their remit, in order that the priorities identified  by the stakeholders at the Forum can be pursued.  <\/p><p>The inaugural stakeholder Forum took place on 30th March 2017, and was attended by civic society organisations who are representative of the needs and views of older people in Ireland.  Following on from this successful Forum, the Department of Health has opened a dialogue with each of the Government Departments identified as having responsibility for the priorities agreed by stakeholders, in order that they are aware of the issues for discussion prior to being contacted by a stakeholder representative group. The Department of Health  will meet with the stakeholder representative group in early 2018 to review the progress made and plan for the next stakeholder forum.<\/p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-##being linked to the Goals and Objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland. The first national Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.<\/p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy and the activities of the HaPAI are strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health<b>,<\/b>and where well-##being is<b><\/b>supported at every level of society.  The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with<b><\/b>accurate information on how to improve their health and well-##being and to make the healthy choices easier choices.  Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400090#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":945,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400090#WRX01950"},{"type":"question","counter":946,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[53813\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400090#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of eligible women aged 50 to 64 years of age screened under BreastCheck to date in 2017.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":947,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[53814\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400090#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of eligible women aged 65 to 69 years of age screened under BreastCheck to date in 2017.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":948,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[53816\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400090#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the percentage uptake of breast screening among the eligible population to date in 2017.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":949,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364, 365 and 367 together.<\/p><p>BreastCheck currently invites women aged 50 to 66 for bi-annual mammograms.

It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.  In addition, it recommended that mental health services should be organised nationally in catchment areas for populations of between 250,000 and 400,000 and that specialist expertise should be provided by community mental health teams - expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to fulfil the needs of service users.<\/p><p>Progress, while slower than originally anticipated, continues to be made in implementing the Report&rsquo;s recommendations.  A number of service improvements have been implemented in parallel with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Service improvements include the development of adult and child &amp;amp; adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services, and the involvement of service users in service planning and delivery.<\/p><p>Other ongoing developments include the development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care, including early intervention at primary care level; a greater awareness of fostering mental health promotion in society through campaigns; the publication of the Expert Review Group Report on the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Suicide Prevention Strategy 'Connecting for Life'; and the commencement of work on the new National Forensic Hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  In addition, funding has been made available to facilitate the transfer of some patients from the Forensic Mental Health Services to the community, investment in high observation in acute mental health units, the improvement of  24\/7 services through additional liaison psychiatry services, new clinical programmes and provision of additional clinical space in community services.<\/p><p><i>'A Vision for Change'<\/i>came to the end of its 10-year term in 2016 and preparations for a review and updating of policy have been underway since early last year.  An external evidence and expert review was completed on 17 February 2017 which provides evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience of implementing A Vision for Change.

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.  A congregated setting is defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. <\/p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,<\/i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. <\/p><p>At the end of December 2016, less than 2,600 people with a disability were living in congregated settings.

These Schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid.  The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.  The technologies supported include onshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, landfill gas, waste-to-energy and biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestion.

This appraisal will ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the RESS closed last month and whilst all submissions are currently being considered in informing the final design of the RESS, no final decisions have been made at this point as regards the technologies that will be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400104#WRMM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fodder Crisis","counter":1429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400104#WRMM02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1430,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[53645\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400104#WRMM02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to introduce a voucher scheme for farmers who are running very low on fodder stocks; and his further plans to draw up a fodder aid fund.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1431,"content":"<p>The\u00a0weather conditions over much of last Autumn were\u00a0challenging for farmers and created difficulties for farmers\u00a0particularly in the Western\u00a0regions and on heavier land types.<\/p>  <p>  Grass growth rates through the autumn were ahead of last year.

I intend to address progress on aspects relevant to my remit as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p>  <p>  A number of the recommendations have been superseded by initiatives which have taken place. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to representation structures for the industry for instance, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) provide arenas for inshore fishermen to develop proposals on inshore fisheries management, including compliance and data gathering. The NIFF is representative of the fishing boats of less than 12m overall length in the fishing fleet.  The focus on the NIFF work programme is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.  The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for policy development including ongoing work in developing a dedicated strategy for the inshore sector. <\/p>  <p>  To date, the twelve NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives.  NIFF members are now included on a number of fisheries consultative structures including the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Industry Science Fisheries Partnership, the SFPA Consultative Committee, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee and BIM\/Bord Bia Market Advisory Group.  This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on range of fisheries policy matters including on allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on data collection and scientific research.  Perhaps most important of these is that the NIFF now has a say on how funding is utilised including through the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee&rsquo;s report refers to managing the lobster and shrimp fisheries.  Changes came into effect in 2014 regarding the management of these fisheries, following on from an extensive consultation process.  In more recent times lobster in particular has been a feature of the agenda of the meetings which I have had with the NIFF and I look forward to a discussion with NIFF on the review of the effectiveness of the current conservation measures in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the mackerel quota, there has been a change to the way this is allocated.  For 2017 and future years, the 87% to 13% share out of the quota between the Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) pelagic fleet and polyvalent segment of the fleet will remain unchanged.  Where Ireland&rsquo;s quota exceeds 90,000 tonnes, the quota shall be shared on a 80% to 20% basis between the pelagic and polyvalent fleet.  A minimum of 2% of the mackerel quota, or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is the greater will be deducted annually for demersal swaps before any share out between segments is undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  There is an open mackerel fishery for vessels under 18 metres in length.  An amount of 2.5% of the overall polyvalent Mackerel Quota has been set aside for this fishery and a monthly catch limit is used.  This catch limit is recommended each month by the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee which consists of fishing industry representatives.  For 2017, under 18m Boats may fish 5 tonnes per month.  In the last number of years much of this quota has remained under-utilised.<\/p>  <p>  The sub-committee made a recommendation with regard to &ldquo;minor fishing infractions&rdquo;.  In November 2014, my Department published a public consultation document in the form of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)  of a proposal for a Bill to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to provide for, inter alia, a system of fixed penalty notices  (&ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines) for minor fisheries offences.    This provided the possibility of creating a subset of minor offences which are legally suitable to be dealt with by way of fixed penalty notices. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, the process suggested in the RIA involved giving a person who was alleged to have committed a minor offence an option to pay a fixed payment which would mean that a prosecution would not be taken in the Courts.   If the payment was not received within 28 days, the prosecution would be initiated in the courts and on conviction it was expected that a higher fine would be applied.<\/p>  <p>  A number of industry submissions received under the RIA on the implementation of fixed penalty notices raised concerns that these would be used in place of verbal or written warnings.  Other comments raised concerns regarding potential inequalities in the application of the system between different Sea Fisheries Protection Authority Port Officers and Naval Service personnel.  There were also comments regarding the constitutionality of applying sanctions in the absence of a Court decision and others seeking a fully administrative system.  In light of the comments submitted in respect of the above proposal on a fixed penalty system, it was decided not to proceed with the introduction such a system.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to fishing infrastructure, it is important to say that my Department owns, maintains and directly manages six Fishery Harbour Centres.   The network of Harbours, located at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l , An Daingean, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth, are a valuable and vital resource to the Irish fishing fleet. The Fishery Harbour Centres provide state of the art facilities and infrastructure for the increasingly mobile and large scale Irish and EU fishing industries.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, I allocated a total of &euro;3.8 million to the Local Authority Programme.  This vital funding targeted 67 approved Local Authority projects with a wide geographical spread, 55 of which are harbour development requiring funding of &euro;2.94 million and 12 relate to marine leisure requiring funding of &euro;879,750.  The infrastructure supported will be of great benefit to many rural coastal and island communities.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to progress on aquaculture, in May 2017 I published the report of the Independent Review Group on aquaculture licensing which contained 30 key recommendations across a full range of activities.  Additional staff have been assigned to the Aquaculture licensing division of the Department so as to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme is the vehicle for financial supports to the seafood sector up to 2021.  The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 15 schemes including specifically in relation to Fisheries Local Action Groups.  Individual schemes are administered by BIM and I will ask BIM to update the Deputy on recommendations relevant to its remit. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, there are a number of recommendations not relevant to the remit of my Department and I have endeavoured to give the Deputy an update on relevant matters, including policy developments, which have occurred since the report was published. I would like to assure the Deputy that this Government is fully commitment to the seafood sector and the coastal communities who are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400105#WRNN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Vessel Licences","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400105#WRNN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[53728\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400105#WRNN03800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on issuing heritage licences by his Department for rural costal and island communities as recommended in the report on promoting sustainable rural coastal and island communities by the Oireachtas joint sub-committee on fisheries;

Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises (including the 21 premises in Crohane (Ed Aghadoe)) \u00a0that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.<\/p><p>As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and roll-out.

In July 2016, I established the Mobile phone and Broadband Task force to identify how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the State led intervention under the NBP.  The work of the Mobile and Phone Broadband Task force will continue to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.<\/p><p>Under this Task force, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.\u00a0 These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact\u00a0in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring\u00a0a much greater degree of consistency\u00a0in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

CSIG includes senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills, National Council for Special Education, National Disability Authority, City\/Community Childcare Committees, Pobal and representatives of parents of children with disabilities and Early Years providers.<\/p><p>I will publish details of the consultation when available and am committed to having it completed by mid 2018.<\/p><p>The decision on a pause in the change to the scheme as against a reversal will be made in the context of the outcome of the consultation exercise.  In this regard however I feel it is worthwhile to set out the original rationale for the decision.  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme.  At that time only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so therefore an allowance was made.  Their ECCE place was split over 2 years, e.g. a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year 2.  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was approved.  This provision of an overage exemption by the DCYA for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education.  Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016\/2017, the further extension of the Programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, it became clear that standard ECCE entitlement had surpassed the initial premise for provision of an overage exemption from the upper age limit.<\/p><p>AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The AIM Early Years Specialists will work with the parents (and guardians), providers, Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) and others (as appropriate) to support the child&rsquo;s transition to primary school.  Any concerns with regard to a child's transition to primary school should be referred to the Better Start Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) application process.  Parents, guardians and providers are advised to engage with the AIM process where a concern in relations to a child's transition to primary school is identified.  More detailed information on AIM can be found at <i>www.preschoolaccess.ie.<\/i>The Department of Education and Skill (DES) also provides for the education of children with special educational needs through a number of support mechanisms, depending on the child's assessed disability.<\/p><p>As regards long term plans for the ECCE scheme, the further enhancements announced as part of Budget 2018 meet the commitment in the Programme for Government to provide a full two year programme to all children.  Any further alterations to the scheme will be considered in the context of future Estimates processes and, critically, an assessment of what is in the best interests of children.  The consultation to take place around overage exemptions will, of course, form part of the ongoing assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400112#WRUU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":1719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400112#WRUU01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1720,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[53897\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400112#WRUU01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to improve services and provide additional facilities in counties Cavan and Monaghan for victims of domestic abuse; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1721,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the provision of care and protection to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.

An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  There were 5,284 unallocated cases, of which  966 were high priority cases, 3,309 were medium priority, and 1,009 were low priority.  Cases awaiting allocation include new referrals, cases already in progress, and children in care.  <\/p><p>I am informed by Tusla that a case awaiting allocation may be listed as 'active' on a 'duty' system.  This means that there are actions being undertaken by a dedicated duty team, or rotating social workers on a duty roster to progress the protection and welfare of the child.  <\/p><p>Examples of actions being undertaken include telephone calls relating to the concern, visits to see the child, completing initial assessments and, where a child is in care, completing child in care reviews or plans.  There are 28% of unallocated cases categorised as 'active on duty'.  <\/p><p>Tusla has provided the information in Table 1 below on the number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker in each administrative area.  Tusla has informed me that the average length of time cases are waiting is not collated nationally but rather by the number of cases waiting in time bands.  Information on waiting times is provided in bands of less than 3 months, and greater than 3 months.  In Table 2 the number of cases waiting less than 3 months and over 3 months for each priority level i.e., high, medium and low is given. <\/p><p>Addressing the number of children who are awaiting the allocation of a social worker is a priority for me.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical or sexual abuse, parental ill-health leading to the need for an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party.  I have secured funds in Budget 2018 which will allow Tusla to carry out the third year of a 3 year plan to provide for the allocation of a dedicated social worker to all children who need one.  <\/p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard, and I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and Senior Management Team to review progress.  <\/p><p><b>Cases awaiting allocation to a social worker September 2017 - numbers and priority level (Child protection &amp;amp;

Participants receive an allowance equivalent to their underlying social welfare payment plus an additional top-up allowance of &euro;52.50 per week as a contribution towards expenses arising from their participation on the programme. Participants are supported by a by a mentor assigned by the Host Organisation and dedicated case worker from the Department and. <\/p><p>The programme is open to organisations in private, public, and voluntary and community sectors.  There are currently 75 participants on the programme - 67 on placements in the private and community\/voluntary sector, and 8 in the public sector.<\/p><p>Host Organisations are required to agree Terms and Conditions and agree a Standard Agreement with the participant outlining the intended learning outcomes and the terms and conditions of the placement.

Figures released by the Central Statistics Office in April 2017, based on questions relating to the National Minimum Wage (NMW) included in the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) in Quarters 2, 3 and 4 2016, indicate that an average of approximately 155,100 employees reported earning NMW or less for each of the three quarters from Quarter 2 to Quarter 4 in 2016.  This represents approximately one in ten employees.  The CSO suggest that some caution is advised in comparing these results to data collected directly from business enterprises in that this is self-reported income.  ESRI research, based on 2014 and 2015 (latest available) Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data, showed the incidence of employees on the NMW at 5.1 and 5.5 percent respectively (based on the then NMW of &euro;8.65).These figures represent approximately one in twenty employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400117#WRZZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Data","counter":1895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400117#WRZZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1896,"qnumday":708,"qnumall":"[54155\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400117#WRZZ00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the rate of youth unemployment here; the way in which this compares with the EU average, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1897,"content":"<p>The rate of youth unemployment was 14.0% in October 2017.  This compares with the most recent available EU figure (from EUROSTAT) of 18.6% as at October 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, the rate of youth unemployment has fallen sharply from a peak of over 31.1% in 2012.

Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 to significantly below the average at the end of 2017.<\/p>  <p>  While this improvement is welcome, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate young unemployed people find and sustain employment. <\/p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.

The initiative was set up on a time-bound basis in order to both better understand and stimulate the taking-in-charge process, due to the backlog of estates waiting to be taken in charge.  Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10m in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for funding proposals under Circular FPS3\/2016 (available at the following link: <i>).<\/i><\/p><p>My Department established a Steering Group to oversee the initiative including funding allocations.  The Steering Group selected the following seven local authorities for demonstration projects - Cork, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Tipperary and Wexford - as these represented about 70% of problematic housing estates nationwide served by Developer Provided Infrastructure (DPI). <\/p><p>A total of &euro;7.7 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 13,400 units.  <\/p><p>While the NTICI was not intended as a rolling funding programme for taking estates in charge but provided instead a focused examination of the issues involved, building on the lessons learned through this programme, I expect that the Initiative will contribute to further streamlining of the taking-in-charge process, through for example synergies with capital works by Irish Water.  In addition, the outcome of the Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan provides for an additional &euro;25m funding to be provided for addressing legacy issues in relation to lead pipe remediation and developer provided infrastructure, details of which will be announced in due course.<\/p><p>A report on the 2016 NTICI is currently being finalised by my Department which will help to inform future taking-in-charge plans.  It is envisaged that the report will be published in Q1 2018.<\/p><p>As Monaghan was not one of the local authorities selected to pilot new approaches to speed up the taking-in-charge process under the NTICI, funding was not available under the NTICI in this case. Nevertheless, publication of the NTICI report in Q1 2018 will be of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking in charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400118#WRAAA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage to Rent Scheme Data","counter":1960,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400118#WRAAA03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1961,"qnumday":730,"qnumall":"[53768\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400118#WRAAA03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of mortgage-to-rent transactions that have been fully completed to date by lender, local authority and approved housing body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1962,"qnumday":731,"qnumall":"[53769\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400118#WRAAA03400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of mortgage-to-rent applications each month in 2017 up to when the scheme was revised; the number of applications each month since the scheme was revised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1963,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[53770\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400118#WRAAA03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of approved housing bodies here; the number that have undertaken a mortgage-to-rent scheme; the number of mortgage-to-rent transactions undertaken by each approved housing body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1964,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 730 to 732, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Since the introduction of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme in 2012, a total of 3,765 cases have been submitted under the scheme to the end of\u00a0September 2017.\u00a0 Of the 3,765 cases submitted,\u00a02,909 were ineligible or terminated during the process.\u00a0 Of the remaining cases submitted, 282 have been completed, and the remaining 574 are actively being progressed. <\/p><p>The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme, including the number of completed transactions by lender, local authority area and\u00a0Approved Housing Body (AHB).\u00a0\u00a0There are currently 7 AHBs participating in the MTR scheme.\u00a0 This information is available on the Agency's\u00a0website at the following link:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Following a\u00a0Review of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme, published on 8 February 2017, a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme came into effect to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers.

In the context of social housing, this will involve a\u00a0blended approach to\u00a0delivery and\u00a0providing local authorities with a range of mechanisms to achieve the best value for money within the financial resources available.  I have made it clear that there must be an increased focus\u00a0on\u00a0building new social housing homes, and it is in that context that I increased the targets for new social housing over the period to 2021 to 50,000 and have provided the necessary financial resources to achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals.  There are currently more than\u00a030,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP.  On average, 350 new households are supported by HAP each week in 2017, and the Rebuilding Ireland 2017 target of supporting 15,000 additional households with the scheme has been exceeded.  The increased HAP rent limits introduced by the Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing \u00a0HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords. \u00a0Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork City regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP. <\/p>  <p>  From available data, at the end of Q3 2017, approximately 20% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 14.4% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility.  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.9% above rent limits provided.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016,\u00a0recommended the introduction of a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising - where households have greatest difficulties in finding accommodation they can afford.\u00a0 The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for the Rent Predictability Measure and\u00a0for areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents\u00a0can now\u00a0only rise by a maximum of 4% annually for a period of\u00a0three years.<\/p>  <p>  This measure was implemented immediately in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork City as these areas already met the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone in December 2016. A further 12 Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) were designated in January 2017, with the measure further extended to Maynooth and Cobh LEAs in March 2017 and to Drogheda and Greystones LEAs in September 2017.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I\u00a0are constantly monitoring HAP data, as well as\u00a0other key information relating to the private rental market.\u00a0 Indications are that the current HAP\u00a0rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. Based on the data outlined above, I am currently satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to meet the demand of the rental market in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme committed to under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400119#WRBBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":1984,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400119#WRBBB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1985,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[54186\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400119#WRBBB01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if further consideration has been given to the introduction of an affordable housing scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1986,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No 34 of 7 December 2017 which sets out the position in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400119#WRBBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400119#WRBBB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1988,"qnumday":740,"qnumall":"[54231\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400119#WRBBB01600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the photography costs for his Department in each year since March 2011 inclusive of costs incurred from use of the ministerial allowance; the list of occasions for which photographers were booked; the photographers used; the costs associated with each occasion that a photographer was used, in tabular form; if there is a policy regarding the booking of photographers within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum in many areas. <\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector.

The power-sharing Executive and the Assembly are responsible for representing the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland, including in relation to how the issues arising with the UK exit from the EU should be addressed.\u00a0 It is imperative that the devolved institutions can urgently operate again so that the North South Ministerial Council can resume its work and bring together the Government and the Executive to oversee and develop North\/South cooperation, including that commenced last year to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive on dealing with the challenges raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit.  <\/p>  <p>  In six of these Sectors provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, co-operation is taken forward by means of the North South Implementation Bodies:\u00a0Waterways Ireland, Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, Special EU Programmes Body, North\/South Language Body, and the Loughs Agency, all of which operate on an all-island basis.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department co-sponsors two of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga \/ the Language Body.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, my predecessor Minister Heather Humphreys had discussed with the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure, Mr Chris Hazard, MLA, whose Department co-sponsors Waterways Ireland, and with the Northern Ireland Minister for Communities, Mr. Paul Givan, MLA, whose Department co-sponsors the Language Body their readiness to further explore the scope for co-operation to achieve the best outcome for the two Implementation Bodies in light of the potential challenges they face.\u00a0 My predecessor, along with her Northern counterparts, attended the last NSMC Plenary meeting in November 2016 at which Common Principles were agreed to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive to deal with the challenges that are raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit from the European Union.\u00a0 I very much hope that these contacts can continue as soon as the NSMC is once again able to meet.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to participate in inter-Departmental preparations for Brexit and has established an internal Working Group to address all Brexit related issues affecting the Department and the State Bodies it funds, including the two North South bodies referred to above. <\/p>  <p>  The arrangements which I have outlined are kept under constant review and will be enhanced as required in light of the ongoing preparations for Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400120#WRCCC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Creative Ireland Programme","counter":2033,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400120#WRCCC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2034,"qnumday":757,"qnumall":"[53912\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121400120#WRCCC02000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the level of funding provided in her Department's Estimates for 2018 for Creative Ireland; the level of funding that will be allocated to local authorities and agencies under the remit of her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":2035,"content":"<p>A budget of &euro;6m has been provided to further the implementation of the Creative Ireland Programme in 2018.

The 702 personnel inducted encompass 567 General Service Recruits across the Army and Naval Service, along with 100 Cadets, 22Air Corps Apprentices and 13 Direct Entry Officers (11 Naval Service and 2 Military Medicine).Females represent 9.8% of those inducted in 2017. The gender breakdown of 2017 recruits across the Defence Forces is currently being compiled by the military authorities, and I will revert to the Deputy with this information when it is available.<\/p><p>The number of Officers, as at 31<sup>st<\/sup>October 2017, is 1,056 out of an establishment of 1,233. The number of Cadets in training has substantially increased recently with 100 Cadets having been recruited in each of the years 2016 and 2017. Approximately 70 Army Cadets will be commissioned in January 2018<\/p><p>As I have previously outlined there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians. These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-state sector job opportunities. <\/p><p>To address these difficulties, a range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions. I have directed the civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding such direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to faciliate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill-sets to re-enter the Defence Forces. The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020<\/p><p>In tandem with these actions my Department is also engaged in planning on a longer term basis.
