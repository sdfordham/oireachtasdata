I am accompanied today by colleagues from the Department who have been involved in developing the range of options as set out in the rainy day fund consultation paper.<\/p><p>I begin by providing some background and context to the proposal on the setting up of a rainy day fund.  The concept was originally mooted by my predecessor as part of the Summer Economic Statement, SES, in 2016.  It was announced that once the medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, of a balanced budget was achieved, a rainy day fund would be set up.  The establishment of the fund forms part of a wider policy commitment to sound and sensible public finances.  It will play an important role in creating a budgetary safety buffer to help absorb inevitable future shocks to our economy, while at the same time ensuring the long-term health of Ireland&rsquo;s public finances.  In the 2017 Summer Economic Statement, the Government committed to consulting the Oireachtas before bringing forward detailed proposals.<\/p><p>The initial proposal for a rainy day fund envisaged an annual contribution of &euro;1 billion per annum to commence post-achievement of the medium-term objective.  Subsequently, the Government reduced the planned contribution to &euro;500 million per annum for the years 2019 to 2021 in order to fund capital expenditure over the same period.  The level of contributions thereafter was left as an open question and it is one of the many topics on which I welcome the committee's views today.  <\/p><p>In budget 2018, I announced that the Government had decided to transfer &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to the rainy day fund when it is established.  I published the consultation paper, on which the Chairman has commented.  I welcome the paper I have received from Fianna F&aacute;il along with the papers from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Before I form any particular view on the specific details of the fund, I hope today to get some initial views from the committee on the outstanding questions I have set out in the consultation paper.  These matters relate to the design, operation and purpose of the fund; as well as the issues of how it is resourced; withdrawal triggers; and its governance.<\/p><p>Broadly speaking, the current proposal is to design a rainy day fund that will primarily meet budgetary demands which may arise from a specific, one-off shock.  As set out in the third section of the consultation paper, a natural question arises as to whether the rainy day fund should be used in the first instance as a contingency reserve.  It would be necessary to clearly define the circumstances under which such reserve funds could be deployed in order to ensure it is used only during a time of crisis.  <i>Force majeure<\/i>events which might necessitate access to the contingency fund may include a natural disaster or a public emergency.<\/p><p>Expenditure based on a withdrawal from a contingency reserve fund would be permissible within the parameters of the fiscal rules.  If at the end of a given budgetary year, the funds within the contingency reserve remained unused, they could then be transferred to a separate rainy day fund, the establishment of which would require primary legislation.  <\/p><p>These are just some of the issues outlined in the consultation paper which require further consultation on this reserve fund.  Other matters to be discussed include: whether such a contingency reserve should be held within the Exchequer account or within a rainy day fund; how the withdrawal triggers should be determined; and what kinds of shocks or events should be considered as triggers.  As I mentioned at the outset, I am keen to hear the views of the members of the committee today on these and other questions that I put forward in the consultation paper.  <\/p><p>Sections 4 and 5 of the paper raise questions on operational and administrative matters associated with the overall rainy day fund.<\/p><p>These design and operational issues relate to the deposit mechanism, the withdrawal mechanism, the size at which the fund should be capped and the replenishment methodology.  Other practicalities to be considered include how the fund might be invested, what governance structures would be most appropriate and who should administer and manage the fund.  <\/p><p> I will identify some of the key design concepts of the fund about which the views of the committee will be important.  The first is the deposit mechanism.  The proposal as currently drafted envisages a deposit mechanism whereby, aside from the &euro;1.5 billion seed funding from ISIF, there will be an annual contribution of &euro;500 million from the Exchequer until 2021.  Clearly, it would be my intention that the annual contribution would continue beyond that point.  Is this a sufficient level of contribution?  Should we be looking to bring additional seed funding into the rainy day fund?  How will name and determine the size of annual contributions after that?  Many options spring to mind.  One would be to have a fixed contribution key in either nominal or as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, or gross national income, GNI, terms.  An alternative could be to lodge windfall tax revenue on the basis of revenues above target in general terms or with regard to specific taxes.  I am sure that members will have other options as well.<\/p><p> In respect of the withdrawal mechanism, clear and defined rules will be required in respect of the events and conditions which could trigger a withdrawal proposal and the process by which such a proposal would be progressed by the various State actors.  International evidence shows that these triggers tend to comprise economic and fiscal triggers such as the level unemployment and revenue and expenditure levels, as well as democratic triggers relating to approval by the Executive and Parliament.  The design of these triggers will be a critical task in developing the fund.  They should be appropriate and relevant as well as being based on data which is timely and transparent.  There is a need to also strike a balance between sufficient checks and balances and a process that allows the speedy utilisation of the funds given they will be needed in a crisis.  <\/p><p> Associated with the interplay between deposits into and withdrawals out of the fund are the issues of the overall fund size and the process by which it should be replenished if it used.  The optimum size must be determined so that we have sufficient capacity to address challenges emerging but also while avoiding the carry costs of a cash or near-cash fund which could become too large.  Given the State's debt levels are consistently identified as one of the State's top risks, the State should always be seeking to pay down debt except where there is a better return for the State.  In this case, the rainy day fund provides resources to mitigate tail-risk events that would have a significant impact on the Irish economy and public finances thus justifying the additional interest costs on the debt that could be paid down by the rainy day fund.  <\/p><p> Once the maximum size is achieved, should annual contributions continue for the purposes of budgetary discipline or cease?  If they continue, should the surplus in the fund be used to pay down our debt?  I consider that the rainy day fund should be of a sufficient size to act as a fiscal buffer.  The rainy day fund should give the economy and public finances time to make the longer term adjustments to re-establish debt market access at normalised levels.  This is connected to the paying down of debt as the lower the State's existing debt level, the more sustainable the cost of debt from markets.<\/p><p> Subsequent to any withdrawal and determined by the target fund size, the fund will need to be replenished to rebuild the fiscal buffer.  Clearly, replenishment will also be influenced by the prevailing economic and fiscal conditions, which might impact on the timing of the Exchequer's capacity to recommence contributions to the fund.  Should the provisions for the replenishment of the rainy day fund be determined now or should they be determined post the withdrawal of the funds? <\/p><p> It is also important to note that everything we do must be must be compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as the Fiscal Compact.  The fiscal rules dictate that use of funds from a contingency reserve or payments into the rainy day fund would be treated as expenditure by the Exchequer.  Payments made to the fund are deemed a financial transaction within general Government but not counted as part of the general Government deficit.  Therefore, any withdrawals from the fund will result in expenditure that worsens the general Government balance.  In addition to all of these issues, the consultation paper outlines some options on the governance structure for the fund and how it might be managed with the NTMA indicated as a clear, and in my view, very good, possibility. <\/p><p>  I look forward to a constructive engagement with the committee now and in the coming months as we pull together the proposal and the legislation relating to this matter.  It is my objective to be in a position that allows us later this year to complete all the work that is necessary to draft this legislation to present it to the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, I welcome the views of the committee on the consultation paper and the different ssues to which I have referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#D00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

With respect to the Minister's predecessor, I think it is Deputy Michael McGrath who has been the champion of the rainy day fund for some years.  I will start where the Minister finished, which is around European fiscal rules.  In its submission, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, is of the view that the current exemptions are unlikely to provide the kind of flexibility the Minister seems to be seeking in terms of the rainy day fund and avoiding a breach of domestic and EU rules.  Has the Minister had any engagement around the design of the rainy day fund to provide it with the flexibility it needs to and to ensure that we are still in compliance with all the various rules?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about international evidence.  The Parliamentary Budget Office has shown us the Estonian example but it did say that there are a few other examples.  Has the Minister unearthed other examples at which the committee could look and make a call in terms of the flexibilities?  <\/p> <p>  I think there are possibly two different roles for a contingency reserve fund and a rainy day fund.  I think they are probably two different animals.  A contingency reserve fund might be something that should be there on an annual basis in the event, which the Minister mentioned in his speech, of some sort of one-off event.  An example would be the flooding two years ago.  In such a case, money could come from a contingency reserve fund.  If that is not needed in a year, the balance left in that fund can go to a rainy day fund, which is much more medium and long term.  Is there not an argument to be made in terms of good prudence for two separate funds - a contingency reserve fund and a rainy day fund, which is a much more long-term fund?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Does the Chairman want me to speak on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Just to brief the Minister, we have looked at having three areas of questioning per member as a first round and then coming back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00500","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will deal with each of them in turn.  With regard to whether there are any other examples of countries that are well advanced in doing this kind of work with a European setting, the answer is \"No\".  When we commence this work in terms of putting together a fund, we will be in the first wave of countries that are looking to carry out this work well.  In terms of compliance with fiscal rules, where there is an intersection with current EU fiscal rules, under the current fiscal rules, there is provision for expenditure to be used in response to so-called exceptional circumstances.  Given that I would only be proposing to use the rainy day fund in light of exceptional circumstances, there is some fit there but once we are clearer in how we want to structure the rainy day fund and how it will operate, we will have to engage further with the Commission with regard to that.  I am optimistic about such discussions.<\/p><p>The European Commission understands the distinction between the day-to-day challenges, the expenditure consequences of the day-to-day management of the State, and exceptional events that require a response from the State.  Given that we are only talking about setting up this fund, once we have achieved our budgetary objectives I am optimistic that we will be able to make this work within the existing rules and with the support of the Commission.<\/p><p> Regarding the Deputy's third question, I agree with what he said.  There are two different ideas: one is a contingency reserve and the other is a rainy day fund.  That is something I have introduced in my discussions with my Department in recent months.  I well remember, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, dealing with the flooding the Deputy referred to towards the end of 2015.  Something that struck me at the time was that when we are dealing with an event in our country that, for example, stretches beyond a county or even a number of counties but affects many regions and, therefore, has a high cost across a number of Departments, inevitably it involves, in the middle of the year or whenever it happens, having to open discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments on how we can respond quickly to something like that.  I believe there should be a better way of doing that.  That is the reason I am interested in the idea of this reserve fund.  In terms of where it would sit, I have an open mind regarding it.  I believe we could do it two ways.  It could be a separate fund to the rainy day fund or, alternatively, it could be a certain level or parcel of funding within the rainy day fund that would have different access criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00600","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In its paper provided to us, the Parliamentary Budget Office pointed out what it referred to as mitigating risks.  In other words, having the cash on hand to react to events such as flooding would improve the State's capacity to deal with that after the event.  It also refers to immediate investment in preventing those events such as flood defences.  How do we achieve that balancing act?  Has the Minister given any consideration to that?  That would also question the need for a contingency fund.  Would the Minister see the need for the contingency fund but also the investment?  Last week, the Minister of State in charge of flooding stated that approximately &euro;1 billion would be needed to complete all the current flood defences and those proposed for the future.<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to the withdrawal criteria for a rainy day fund.  One aspect the briefing paper highlights is the way the criteria would be written into legislation.  The Minister said in his contribution that for a longer or medium-term rainy day fund, he might have to consider primary legislation in terms of the criteria and how we would access it.

Following on from the crash in 2008, the fund is envisaged to be counter-cyclical, in that we would address cases of deep recession and we should also have the ability, when the economy is overheating, to withdraw funds from the economy and try to stabilise it.<\/p> <p>  We had an interesting discussion last week with the Parliamentary Budget Office.

There is an opportunity cost when we save money, such as the &euro;500 million proposed for the rainy day fund, so if there is no real benefit in terms of counteracting a recession, is there really a purpose to a contingency reserve fund?  Using it in a counter-cyclical way is probably the intention and we are all of the view that we are trying to avoid what happened ten years ago from happening again.  A contingency reserve probably would not stop that happening.<\/p> <p>  The figure put to us last week from the parliamentary budget office was that we would probably need in the region of &euro;20 billion to put a counter-cyclical fund in place.  With &euro;1.5 billion going in initially and &euro;500 million going in thereafter up to 2021, it would take us nearly 40 years to put the fund in place with such a level of contribution.  Is that sufficient or if it is not possible between now and 2021, will the Minister would ask for feedback on the contribution post-2021?  If we are serious about putting in a counter-cyclical fund to deal with times of recession, the amount being put in must be greater.  The Minister's Department and this committee would need to investigate the opportunity cost to the State were we to go that far.<\/p> <p>  On the design, operation and purpose of the fund, I agree that we have far too much in the Constitution as it is and there is no place in it for such matters.  It is for the Parliament of the day to decide on this.  The Minister is also correct in saying there should be defined criteria.  I also suggest there should be parliamentary control and this should not just be down to the Department of Finance to decide when cases meet the criteria.  I am not suggesting we need 100% agreement, as we will never have that, but some sort of parliamentary control would be desirable.  I suggest a built-in review, perhaps every three or five years, to assess whether it is working and the ongoing opportunity cost to the country of putting aside substantial amounts of money on an annual basis.  It should also assess whether the amount decided to be put aside would continue to be sufficient.  Were that amount to be insufficient, we obviously would need to address that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister wanted feedback on the purpose of the fund and I believe its purpose must be counter-cyclical or else there is no point to it.  I would welcome the Minister's view on that.  I would also welcome his view on how we can go about assessing the opportunity cost and dealing with an ongoing review within the Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#G00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's first point that it must be counter-cyclical.

Perhaps it will not be all the Opposition, although I suspect it will be.  They will argue there is a better use for the money now.

When we have it up and running, it should be a minimum of &euro;500 million.

The more easily measurable one, therefore, will be whether we pay down debt or put the money into the fund.

Has the UK Government's budgets always included a contingency amount, going back several centuries?  The Minister is speaking about contingencies such as an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  He is presiding over a homelessness and housing crisis.  Every Deputy receives messages hour in, hour out from people who are in desperate situations.  This morning I raised with the Minister's colleague, the Taoiseach the issue of the health budget and whether the Government had made a grave error in the health Estimates for 2018.  I cited one specific waiting list for children on the autistic spectrum who needed early intervention assessments.  The Minister may know because it is also his district that the waiting list is well over 300 children, 150 of whom have been waiting for more than a year and some for almost two years.  These are contingencies for which he should have provided in normal budgeting.<\/p> <p>  I remember that the Minister said about something else that it was bonkers.  That seems to be a favourite word of his, but is it not bonkers to be thinking in these terms when the Government is not meeting the essential needs of the people?  Clearly it has not met them in the areas of health and housing this year and perhaps in education and others also.  If it cannot meet them, why are we talking in a nonsensical way about setting up a rainy day fund?  I look back at the record of the Minister's predecessor as Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, about which people will be incredibly critical in the future but not the media that tends to puff up Fine Gael.  However, others will look back at it and see the real austerity and setbacks people had to endure during the period, which we need not have had to endure because the Minister and others voted in favour of a blanket bank guarantee.  At this stage of our development, I look back on it as being bonkersand cannot see any basis for it.  The country has a debt of &euro;42,000 per citizen, one of the highest national debt figures anywhere and still greater than 100% GNI.  Why would we let it sit there?  If the position will be better in 2019, 2020 or 2021, why would we not use the resources to try to get back to where we were before the Government made the errors it made and the errors made by the previous Government in 2011?  At this stage in our history, the basis seems to be incredibly flawed.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about deposit mechanisms.  Has he given any consideration to hypothecation?  If he were to do this in the future and we were running significant surpluses, perhaps we might look at a surtax on very wealthy earners which might be hypothecated into a fund.  We had a pension fund which was our wealth fund.  We were not in the league of the Norwegians or the Saudi Arabians, but we had a significant wealth fund which the Minister's predecessor and former Deputy Brian Cowen totally got rid of, diminished and blew away.  The NTMA is holding a net &euro;14 billion, but it has to engage in significant refinancing in 2018 and 2019.  As the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Finance know, the situation is still dodgy enough in refinancing the national debt.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about emergencies.  I will take flooding as an example.  We have always known it.  It dates back to the time of the de Valera Governments in the 1930s and was something the State did not address.  To be fair to some of the Minister's colleagues, we are beginning to address it, but we always knew about it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Estonia.  There is a group of Deputies who interact with others in some of the Baltic countries.  Estonia suffers from grave infrastructural deficits and has a very small population.  I do not know, therefore, whether it should be used as a model.  By the way, Finland has a countercyclical fund, as we are told in the report of the Minister's Department.  Again, one wonders as the Finnish experience is different from ours.  There is no point in comparing Ireland to the United States because it cannot run a deficit or borrow.  I do not know whether this is fantasy or, to use the Minister's own words, just bonkers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>When historians look back at the verdict on the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, they will see that he was a Minister who, despite the profound crisis facing the country, made choices that enabled the country and our society get to a point the Deputy said we would never reach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>We took a different approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00400","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Deputy is someone who for many years-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>We had a different policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00600","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Deputy is someone who for many years said-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Luckily the Greeks carried him through one of the crises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00800","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>-----the recovery that is now happening would not happen and that the economic resources now in place would never be available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H01000","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>On his contribution and all of the contributions he makes, I agree with him on the level of need and the many challenges we face in public services, whether it be health or housing, and I am committed to addressing them.

The Deputy's overall contribution proves the point Deputy Lisa Chambers put to me, that it is a matter of an opportunity cost.

In terms of the language used by the Minister, it almost feels we are in a \"Back to the Future\" moment, with extremely Bertie Ahernesque language being used in referring to there being more people at work then ever before, things being better than ever and so forth.  I sat in these and similar rooms ten years ago when I was very sceptical about that type of language.  At the time I warned about some of the inherent dangers.  I can understand the reason the Minister is delighted that more people are back at work because I am delighted too.  I doubt that anybody in the room is not delighted.  However, the tone of the language of quasi-celebration, with fist pumping almost taking place, except that we do not do that in the D&aacute;il, is strange.<\/p> <p>  The crash happened from 2008 onwards because as the economy collapsed we could not borrow internationally.  Around September 2010 the markets rated Ireland's debt costs as extremely high, to the point where we could no longer afford it.  Once the debt interest rate went over 7% - John Palmer knows these figures - we were basically out of the game.  There were many discussions about when the IMF would arrive with a package and the model it had adopted at the time.  Incidentally, it subsequently did not adopt that model for France, Italy and Spain because they were bigger EU countries.  <\/p> <p>  What I am hearing from the Minister is both intriguing and confusing.  At the time we had the National Pensions Reserve Fund which, if memory serves, was up to &euro;18 billion.  It was certainly over &euro;17 billion.  It was nabbed by the troika as our first payment under its package.  The money had been set aside, not in law but in general indicative commitments similar to the ones the Minister is indicating today, to pay for Civil Service pensions in the era after 2025 and potentially, although it was never clarified, retirement pensions paid by the Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I was never clear on the second point, but they were the indications.  I see Mr. Palmer nodding; therefore, my recollection is right.<\/p> <p>  We face the very same challenge on pensions, except that it is closer and higher.  If the Minister said he was going to set aside funding to pay for the demographic changes occurring in the country, for example, I would understand it.  However, the last such fund was taken in its entirety by the troika.  I stood in a room with a tall Hungarian - I was in opposition at the time - who asked me if we were prepared to give everything up.  The troika specifically had in its sights on all public utilities, led by the ESB.  The Government of which I was a member held it off and there was a difference of views on what should happen in that Government.<\/p> <p>  I am really confused.  Technically, I do not understand the status of the rainy day fund in respect of our debt level.  I agree that the current level of debt is a negative in the assessment of Ireland.  There is a profound argument that if surplus funds are available, they should be used, as has been done by the Department, something on which I have supported the Minister 100%, to recycle debt to cheaper debt at lower rates of interest or to pay down debt when it becomes opportune and advisable to do so.  Even in the scenario outlined by the Minister today, that would be the most sensible argument.  We would then have an enhanced or enlarging capacity to meet at cheaper debt rates in the current markets.<\/p> <p>  I realise it was the Minister's predecessor who came up with this idea and that the Minister inherited this horse, camel or giraffe - to be honest, I do not know what it is.  I also understand and accept his comments on the contingency reserve fund.  I was Minister in a Department which every year had to expend millions to deal with flooding, including in the Chairman's constituency.  A couple of months after we took office there were extensive flood waters coming down from the Dublin Mountains into various rivers; therefore, I accept the remarks made on the contingency reserve fund.  There is also the pensions issue.  Dealing with all of these issues would make much more sense.<\/p><p>The Minister has not yet said what the rules for this fund will be in the context of withdrawals, except to indicate that it will come out of public expenditure.

The objective is that if the economy gets into difficulty in the future, money will be available to us which we can invest in the economy to offset that difficulty.  I am struck by the fact that some of the countries that have been most successful in doing this, although they are asset rich, are those of a socially-democratic persuasion politically.  When they get into difficulty at a point in the future, they will be able to invest in capital programmes in order to employ people at a time at which unemployment would otherwise be rising.  For me, it is as simple as that.  It operates on a countercyclical basis.<\/p> <p>  On the other questions the Deputy has put to me, her description of the bind is correct.  If we put money in, it will reduce our net debt, although it will not affect our gross debt, as the Deputy well knows.  She is also correct that when the funds are used, it will count as expenditure.  However, we could get to a point at which we would have a choice between borrowing to fund expenditure or having access to a bank account in order to fund that expenditure ourselves without having to incur high interest payments.  Amid all of the complexity, which the Deputy was right to raise, that is the simple insight on which I am trying to hone in.

I was simply making the point that, in contrast with what Deputy Bruton said, there are some good things happening in our country and the economy.

The Minister can tell them that we have a given number of billions stashed away but unless he were to use the model of wealth fund Norway or some states in the Middle East and the Far East use, it would not count because it would be, in a certain sense, relatively small potatoes.  That is why the National Pensions Reserve Fund just got chopped at the time.  The Minister is talking of markets.  The markets are very tough.  I just do not get the technical explanation.  Although I am not putting this forward as a proposition, it would seem that if the Minister's objective is to improve the country's debt position, there is an argument for improving the country's gross debt situation because, in the long run, that will stand to us more in the context of the markets because they will see that debt is on the decline.

I am not putting this proposition forward with the direct objective of reducing our gross national debt.  I never presented this proposition in such a way.  As I have said on a number of occasions, this is about creating the capacity for the State to deal with an external shock in a way that avoids the need to borrow in the future at what would be a higher interest rate.  That is the policy objective I am trying to address.  A consequence of setting up such a fund is that it would reduce our net debt level, but not our gross debt level.  However, I am not proposing that we set up a fund to affect our debt metrics because, as the Deputy is correct to say, if that was my objective, the simpler way to do it would be to reduce the national debt in the first instance and pay it off.<\/p> <p>  On the view of the rating agencies in this regard, one of the interesting things is that the external rating agencies, which made grave mistakes in the run-up to the financial crisis, were actually more alert to the difference between Ireland's gross debt position and our net debt position than many of the analysts and opponents at home who were predicting imminent default at every point as the country worked its way through grave difficulty.  The other choices which the Deputy has outlined illustrate the scale of the choice involved in this because, if we decide to put money into the rainy day fund, it means that we are deciding not to put it into health expenditure.  The Deputy is correct on that.  That is why, before I move this into the legislative arena at all, I thought it valuable to have a discussion about the costs and benefits of the policy I am proposing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#K01200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair, I have the joy of being last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#K01300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>There will be a second round for anyone who wishes to speak.

I am mindful of the fact that a number of my colleagues on this committee from Opposition parties have highlighted the fact that they have been calling for this measure for some time.  If one was to be cynical, one could argue that members of the largest Opposition parties would be very keen to see the Government and Minister for Finance lock away much of the money we are earning from our prudent fiscal approach and save it for them to spend when they get into power.  Perhaps that is what they are thinking.  However, it makes sense to have a contingency reserve.  Really what we are talking about here is the process - what it would look like and how it would play out.  Will the Minister outline the kind of events he could see triggering the use of a rainy day fund in practical terms?  I know there has been upset at some of the examples which have been given.  How would this look to people?<\/p> <p>  On the funding beyond 2021, it obviously becomes harder to predict what these things will look like the further into the future one looks.  This is a medium-term approach, however, so I presume that the Department would have a view on how it could continue.  Would it continue at the same rate or does the Minister believe it would need to be ramped up in the future as budgets allow?  That would be my main point.  The Minister has already outlined that the purpose of this proposal is to provide a bit of extra security and a buffer for things as they arise.  It is hard to plan for every eventuality but I would like to get a clear idea of the type of circumstances in which he sees the need for this arising and the type of circumstances for which he would not see this fund being used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#K01500","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>The kind of things I see it being used for include global recession, which has a significant effect on a very small and open economy; a natural disaster of some kind; some event happening in the financial markets; or as a result of policy choices made here at home that lock us out of access to the financial markets again.  I used the example earlier of a disease that affected our economy and has grave consequences for it.  I was simply making the point that a Government can invest a lot of money in trying to prevent particular phenomena from happening but those or other phenomena can still happen and there has to be a response.  From my experience of being involved in trying to do that, particularly regarding extreme weather events, I think it is a good idea to have a way to access funding like that in a more predictable way than at present.  This would help a number of Departments, particularly the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government, to maintain their day-to-day commitments while dealing with the kinds of events that happen every few years to a country despite the best efforts of everybody most of the time.  I absolutely envisage contributions extending beyond 2021, otherwise, as Deputy Burton touched on, we would not get the fund up to the critical scale that would enable it to deal with the kind of events to which countries need to respond.  As a result, it will need to continue beyond 2021.  I do not see us being in a position to take billions of euro out of day-to-day expenditure and put it into this fund because of the pressures the Government faces each day in using tax receipts to fund public services.  The more likely sources of that money are one-off gains to the Exchequer, particular tax headings doing exceptionally well for a period, and putting in place an amount of money each year that is genuinely sustainable and which we are confident we can maintain for a number of years.  To approach it in any other way would set up expectations that no Government would be able to meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#L00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I agree with that approach.

Is there a risk that something which might not be seen as a big emergency in some years, a year out from an election, for example, could be used by a Minister to free up &euro;500 million for a slush fund to splash around the economy?

I go back to the point I made earlier.  Traditionally, when economies such as our own have had to deal with global events or the kind of phenomena I outlined a moment ago, the way they do it is by borrowing more.  That is a perfectly legitimate policy choice to make.  It is perfectly legitimate to borrow more and to respond to difficulty.  There are many levels of borrowing that can develop which act as automatic stabilisers that an economy triggers as it goes into difficulty.  One of the challenges of that is that normally when a Government needs to do that, it ends up paying a higher rate of interest on the borrowing because rates of interest tend to be the lowest when one needs to borrow the least.  The core of the idea is whether it is worth trying to set aside an amount of money to offset the effects in our society of tough external circumstances instead of borrowing the money at interest rates that will be far higher than is currently the case.  I am trying to portray the idea simply.  I am not running away from the inherent difficulties.  The moment we set it up and the moment the money starts being put in, people will ask why we are not using the money to invest in dealing with the difficulties of today.

The Minister touched on the European view on this matter.  It is very early stages.  I would have thought our European partners' view would be that budgetary issues are managed within the fiscal rules.  If there is no willingness to move from that then expenditure coming out of the fund would have to count as expenditure.  We would get no benefit from looking at expenditure going into it.  Could there be a European view not in favour of states establishing funds of this sort?  Would they prefer to see the budgetary process managed primarily through the current and existing fiscal rules set-up rather than states engaging in this process?  If we were to establish a fund - I cannot see how we ever would - that was of sufficient size and scale to deal with a countercyclical issue, the deployment of the fund would probably be in breach of the fiscal rules.

That is why we have so much focus on something that is simple in concept but very difficult to measure, which is the structural performance of an economy.  That is an ongoing spread of all EU economic policy at the moment.<\/p> <p>  On the Chairman's final question about whether the use of such expenditure would breach existing fiscal rules, my view is it would not but clearly we would have to work it all out with the Commission.

I think this has a great bearing on the country's capacity to invest in key areas such as housing, health and so on, which we referenced.  It might be helpful to this discussion to have a note about the off-balance sheet rules.  They have become much more Germanic.

I am developing a bit of understanding from the meeting that we are probably looking at two separate issues.  The Minister said that his preference would be a countercyclical approach.  The language is important because if we are looking at approximately &euro;500 million, that is not really countercyclical.  The Minister would agree with that.  We are looking at two separate issues.  If that is the case, we will need two separate types of withdrawal criteria.  If there is a countercyclical rainy day fund and withdrawal criteria set out in primary legislation, then will annual events such as flooding - which is becoming an annual event - be suitable for a rainy day fund or for the emergency contingency fund?  I know the Minister is open to all this at the moment.  Is he looking at two different funds right now?  Would that be the preference of the Department?  I think he has already said that primary legislation would be needed for a counter-cyclical rainy day fund, but I would see difficulty in putting a contingency fund into primary legislation because one would want to access it quickly if it was something like foot and mouth disease or a flooding event.  One would not want to spend three weeks trying to get permission through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will the Minister make that clear?  On the actual funding of the rainy day fund, if there are two separate issues, the &euro;500 million would, to me, be the short-term immediate contingency fund.  How will we fund the longer-term model?  I know the Minister said that one might be looking at such things as once-off gains to the Exchequer, maybe tax surpluses.  In that case, is it not very hard to define how quickly we could actually establish a rainy day fund of &euro;20 billion?  We do not know what once-off gains to the Exchequer could be coming down the road or what tax surpluses may or may not happen.

He summarised my own thinking on the matter, which is that we would look at putting together a fund which would have a countercyclical effect on the economy.  I will make one point.  Let us say we were to set up the fund as I am describing and stop contributions in 2021, for the sake of argument.  We would end up with a fund of approximately &euro;3 billion, which could make a difference to the lives of many people in our country if we were to get into difficulty.  An unfortunate effect of the awful difficulty we have gone through and are currently trying to get out of is that we have become a little anaesthetised to large amounts of money.  A Government dealing with a slowdown in global economic growth or a global recession that had &euro;3 billion or &euro;3.5 billion available to it over a couple of years could make a difference through, for example, putting in place capital programmes or providing additional work to people if they lost their jobs because of what was happening in export markets.  Amid all the debate regarding what I am seeking to do, that is the simple idea here and it could make a big difference.  The Deputy is correct to say that my current direction of travel is to have a particular fund that would deal with that kind of cyclical experience.<\/p> <p>  Second, I am putting forward for evaluation by the committee the idea that, either within that or separately, or even held within Departments, we should be looking at the idea of whether we can better plan for when events are more predictable in the future but will have a lower effect rather than being a crisis for the entire country.  Much of this is influenced by my time as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, when I had to deal with a series of flooding events.  If those flooding events happened towards the end of the year, at which point most capital expenditure had already been committed and most current money was gone, responding at the speed at which communities want could be difficult.  That is why I am presenting this idea for discussion.  I will see what the committee has to say about it when it gives its own views back to me.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has outlined the different ways in which it could be funded.  I have outlined them myself.  He is right.  It could mean that it could take quite a while to get up to a fund that would be of significant critical mass, possibly tens of billions.  I think we still lose sight of the fact, in that debate, that billions of euro spent over 12, 18 or 24 months could have a significant effect on people's lives if we were facing into difficulty.  The most recent crisis we went through absorbed &euro;120 billion of the State's money on the fiscal side to deal with the difficulty that we were in.  I hope we never go through an experience like that again but we will go through different difficulties.

Does it have anything to teach us?  Is the Minister exploring other options to PPPs that might free up capital or take advantage of capital in respect of investment in infrastructural projects?<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question on the HSE.  We have a note here that the HSE is potentially facing a financial shortfall in 2018.  Has that been accounted for in the baseline budget figures for 2018?  I will relate that to a specific example in my constituency where Tallaght hospital has two or three major projects, one being an intensive care unit that is at design stage.  The other project is a renal unit that had been approved for funding by the HSE.  Tender documents issued for it in December with the intention of awarding that contract in March.  The HSE has now extended the tender process until October with the hope that it can award the contract in early 2019 when funding may be available.  My understanding is that the problem lies with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform side of the Minister's area of responsibility.  The HSE formally confirmed funds last June but it is now citing an unanticipated deficit in the capital budget for 2018 arising from cutbacks applied by the Department in October.  That has now caused the delay not just of this project, which is not just a once-off project but is part of a jigsaw of projects about which Tallaght hospital management have been pretty keen and excited.  I would welcome the Minister's comments in that regard.<\/p> <p>  If there is a deficit in the capital budget, could the Minister confirm that funding is available for the national maternity hospital and where will it come from?

The benefit they have for the State is that we do not make any payments for a project until it is either open or finished.  That is why PPPs play a valuable role but I continue to take a careful approach to them in that we must decide on a project-by-project basis whether they are the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>  I hope and expect that the difficulties regarding the schools that are being built by Carillion will be resolved.

They provide hospice services, intellectual disability services, training and education services, and home care services.  The members of unions employed in section 39 organisations are all qualified in their fields of expertise to the same standard as their counterparts employed directly by the HSE and those employed in section 38 organisations.  Section 39 organisations provide services through service level agreements with the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p> Many of these organisations are household names, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, Rehab Group, comprising Rehabcare and the National Learning Network, and Cheshire Homes.  The numbers employed in these organisations can range from as few as three to several hundred.  We estimate that there are approximately 12,000 full-time equivalents employed in the sector.<\/p><p> Our members employed in section 39 organisations are not public servants.  As a result of this, they do not fall within the scope of public sector pay agreements, including the most recent public service stability agreement.  However, a significant number of section 39 organisations have established pay linkages with the pay scales in the HSE and wider public service.<\/p><p> In 2010, the HSE formally advised section 39 organisations that the block grant would be cut and that the cut in the grant was to be achieved through cuts in staff salary in line with those applied to public servants under FEMPI legislation.  The HSE at that time also confirmed that it would not pay section 39 organisations for incremental progression.  As a result of this, the pay of union members in section 39 organisations had the same cuts applied to them as those in the public sector.  However, union members in section 39 organisations continued to provide the vital services that so many people relied on.<\/p><p> As members of the committee will be aware, the process of gradually restoring the pay of public servants commenced as part of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Once this process was under way unions with members employed in section 39 organisations submitted claims for the restoration of pay.  A small number of section 39 employers commenced restoration in 2017 from their own resources while the majority did not citing inability to pay, as the HSE did not make the appropriate amendments to the block grant it cut in 2010.<\/p><p> In response to the claims submitted by unions the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform continued to maintain that section 39 organisations have no pay linkage to the public service.  The HSE advised section 39 organisations that unions in the sector would probably make claims for pay restoration.  However, the HSE instructed section 39 organisations that these claims should not be conceded and should be referred to the WRC and Labour Court as appropriate, as outlined in appendix 2.<\/p><p> Unions with members in the section 39 organisations have pursued claims for pay restoration through the WRC and the Labour Court.  The Labour Court has issued recommendations supporting the unions claim for pay restoration in at least eight cases.  However, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have refused to provide the additional funds to allow for the implementation of the Labour Court recommendations.  This position is untenable and unacceptable.  Furthermore, agreement has been reached under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission on increased funding for section 39 organisations from the HSE to provide for increases in pay due to members of unions who provide sleepovers.<\/p><p> It is untenable and unacceptable particularly in light of statements by the Taoiseach in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that there was an established pay link between section 39 organisations and the wider public service, and in the knowledge that the Oireachtas passed a motion calling for a the issue of pay restoration to be resolved through an agreed process.<\/p><p> The ongoing refusal by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Department of Health and HSE to engage in negotiation or indeed a focused, transparent and dedicated process with the aim of restoring the pay of union members in section 39 organisations has forced one union in the sector to service notice of strike action.<\/p><p> I will now outline the impact on the sector.  The apparent unwillingness to restore the pay of union members in section 39 organisations is having a devastating effect on staff morale.  Staff, all of whom are professionally qualified, are now starting to vote with their feet and are leaving to take up opportunities to work in section 38 organisations, the HSE or the Department of Education and Skills.  Section 38 organisations, the HSE and the Department of Health are in a position to offer higher rates of pay courtesy of pay restoration under the terms of the public service stability agreement.  In addition both the HSE and section 38 employers are offering incremental credit in recognition of experience and service.  This has also resulted in section 39 organisations increasing their reliance on agency staff which members of the committee will be aware is more expensive than employing staff directly.<\/p><p> The ongoing difficulties are also beginning to impact on those who rely on the education training support and care services provided by section 39 organisations.  We have reports that service users are now been subjected to breaks in continuity of care.  The committee will be aware that sections 38 and 39 organisations provide 18% of health and social care services that are available as part of public health services.  These services could not be directly provided by the HSE without massive investment in additional capacity.<\/p><p> In this submission, we have attempted to summarise the problems faced by union members regarding their pay and the knock-on impact on staff morale.  We have also sought to highlight the impact on the people who rely on the services provided by these organisations.  While we appreciate that the committee may not be in a position to resolve the issues we have sought to highlight, we hope the information the committee will gather during the course of the morning will allow it to advocate for initiatives that will lead to a satisfactory resolution for all concerned.

Our experience in dealing with them has been extremely frustrating and exasperating.  We are not surprised at their non-attendance today.<\/p> <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee today on behalf of the thousands of workers in section 39 organisations across Ireland who need the committee's support and intervention to achieve pay equality with their opposite numbers in section 38 organisations and HSE services.  I also thank the committee on behalf of the many thousands of people who use the services being run by section 39 organisations, as they too are suffering the effects of this failure by the Government to treat staff equally.<\/p> <p>  Members have all been extensively briefed on the issue before the committee today.  They know that the vast majority of section 39 organisations took the same pay cuts as their section 38 and HSE colleagues, when the FEMPI cuts were imposed.  They know that they were left with no choice but to do so, as their block funding was cut on this basis.<\/p> <p>  Traditionally, section 39-funded organisations had aligned salary scales applicable to all their employees to the Department of Health consolidated salary scales which operate across both the HSE and section 38-funded organisations.  All pay cuts to the Department of Health&rsquo;s consolidated salary scales which arose as a result of implementation of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 were fully implemented by the majority of section 39 organisations following the collapse of the public finances after 2010.  They also complied with the terms of both the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements. <\/p> <p>  Now pay is being restored to HSE and section 38 workers but there has been indifference so far to the pleas being made by section 39 organisations and their workers for equality and fairness.  One of the arguments being used by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to defend its refusal to fund pay restoration is that our workers are not public servants.  This is true, but let me clear up something.  We are not looking to be added to the public service numbers.  We are not asking to be made section 38 organisations.  We are asking for fairness and equality and to be funded in order to restore pay to our workers.<\/p><p>This funding is essential to delivering the service because our staff are essential to delivering the service.  We provide services on behalf of the State on the basis of the annual service arrangement with the HSE, and we are all required, similar to section 38 organisations, to sign the annual compliance statements.  As employers, we are engaging in processes in the Workplace Relations Commission and in the Labour Court.  We do not resist this process but if we are told to restore these payments, we simply cannot do so without funding.<\/p><p> This unacceptable position has given rise to a number of serious concerns for section 39 organisations as follows.  A significant pay gap has now opened up.  Staff employed by section 39 organisations are now being paid circa 10% less than colleagues on similar grades employed by section 38 organisations.  Section 39 organisations are experiencing serious difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff who are critical to the provision of essential services.  It is the people using the services who are suffering most.  Staff employed by section 39 organisations have been balloted for industrial action by their trade union, SIPTU, as already mentioned.  They have voted overwhelmingly for strike action.  If this goes ahead, it will have very serious implications for the people who use our services, especially those in residential services.  There is now a very high attrition rate among social care workers employed by section 39 organisations, which is leading to a concerning diminution in both the quantum and quality of services provided, leading to stress and anxiety in the people who avail of services and their families.  We are also very concerned that despite the level of political support we have received for the case we are making, there has been no satisfactory response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We had hoped with its attendance today that we would receive some words of comfort.  That is clearly not going to happen now.<\/p><p> We appreciate the opportunity to set out our case for support to the committee today.  Our organisations and others in the health care sector have been lobbying for the restoration of funding which is necessary if we are to deliver services on behalf of the State for its most vulnerable citizens.  I hope we will finally be heard.  I do not need to remind the committee that the organisations we represent provide vital services for the State.  Historically, we have stepped in when the State was either unwilling or unable to do so.  During the recession, we took on more services at the request of the State during the moratorium on recruitment.  We are not-for-profit organisations, operating independently but reliant on the State for funding.  We are asking for fairness and for acknowledgement that the work we do is the same as our colleagues in the public service and should be equally funded.  Without this funding, our services will be put at risk and the people who use our services will equally be put at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in.  In fairness, the way in which they have battled with such great dignity is a credit to them.  There is much political support across the board for this plight.  We are seeing that ultimately the paymaster is deliberately not engaging.  We have see the greatest example of it here today.  Colleagues should remember that we are being watched at this committee by the Departments of Health, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach.  They are watching this to see how to judge the political pendulum.  It is the reality and it should be borne in mind as the cameras focus on us.  They need to get a clear message based on the information and evidence that will be given today on the matter they will face very soon.  It is my objective to get that from the comments today.<\/p> <p>  We all know the history of this, going back to 2010, and there is no need to go through all of it.  We are all very well aware of it.  The organisations have engaged by going through the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission on sleepovers etc.  Is it the absolute belief of the witnesses that the principal blockage is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as it relates to the Department of Health and the HSE?  Do the witnesses believe strands relate to the HSE and the Department of Health?  A second question relates to the impact this has on service provision.  Will the witnesses describe this as it relates to recruitment and retention of workers?  How will this multiply as an issue in the coming weeks and months if this continues?  What impact will that have on service provision in terms of quantity and quality?<\/p> <p>  There is also the matter of cost.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has reneged on its responsibilities and jumped from this equation.  In this scenario, agency staff have to be brought in.  The Department that is supposed to look after public expenditure and the taxpayer would want to keep an eye on this.  With the overuse of agency staff, will the witnesses outline what they estimate is the extra cost that arises from the Department's failure to deal with the matter?  There are costs on the other side that make the argument even stronger.  A strike is inevitable unless the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform engages on this.  Will the witnesses outline to the committee, the watching public and the three Departments I mentioned, as well as the HSE, the consequences of a strike?

This is a very welcome development.  It seems a bit odd that it happened when the workers were trying to resist cuts.<\/p> <p>  I have questions for both parties.  We know the industrial action by workers is due to kick off on St. Valentine's Day, 14 February.  Will the representatives outline what efforts are currently being made to avert that and at which stage are the negotiations?  What is the level of involvement or interest from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  The Department has sent a very loud message this morning through its non-attendance.  Is it involved, either peripherally or otherwise, in the negotiations?  Has it any influence?  What is the state of play in that regard?  Last night on the radio I heard a process was under way and a deal was offered of some form.  My understanding is it is not acceptable to all the parties involved.<\/p><p>If we are to be of any assistance at all, we need to understand the state of play.  My question on the cost is for both parties and concerns the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I find this matter quite ironic because some or most of the delegates may know that when the pay cuts were initiated, I was representing the people at the business end of those cuts.  The Department and paymasters were very clear about the need to cut the pay.  If they were very clear about the need to cut the pay, they would have been very clear about the money they would be saving in the national interest or whatever other interest required them to take money from people earning a wage pretty close to the minimum wage.  Will the delegates give us some sense of the cost?  They might tier it for us.  Clearly, there will be ongoing costs.  There is now a restitution process.  We must bear in mind the money required for pay to catch up with that of public service colleagues in addition to money required to fund this in the future.  We need to hear confirmation that, if the dispute is settled, the money will find its way to where it is required.  We realise there are considerable pressures on the service.  In the event that some of money becomes available, pressure will be exerted to have it devoted directly to service delivery.  We can fully understand that pressure.  Are the delegates in a position to confirm to us that money made available through the pay restitution process, irrespective of how this comes about, will be made available to the workers in the first instance?  I understand it is a very hard decision to make.  Clearly, we are here to discuss an industrial relations matter and an industrial relations dispute.<\/p><p> Will the delegates outline whether they have to use agency staff to plug the gaps?  In the HSE, agency staff are being used.  Agency staff are not good value for money.  The Minister for Health agreed with me when I said that on a number of occasions.  How is the pressure that is being exerted manifesting itself?  Do the delegates believe that, if the recruitment and retention crises continue or deepen, they may find themselves in circumstances in which they have to rely on agency staff?<\/p><p> My last question is for the representatives from the various federations and organisations.

The first question, asked by Deputy Kelly, was whether it was our belief that the blockage is at the level of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is our experience.  We have engaged extensively with the HSE as it is our funder.  The HSE, from the get-go, has consistently held the position that provision for pay restoration for section 39 organisations was not included in the overall HSE allocation at the start of the year.  The HSE is sympathetic, or, to use its term, not unsympathetic on the issue but it has not been funded by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with this.  That has been the consistent message.

In the absence of a resolution to this issue, it is only going to get worse.  Senator Dolan alluded to the fact that there is a natural progression in that if one can find similar employment in an organisation that offers better terms and conditions, it is only natural to be attracted to it.  In the absence of any action on this, I can only see the circumstances becoming much worse.  Ultimately, the main concern for everyone in the room is people with disabilities and their families.

There are more issues coming down the line.

The first concerns the impact on one of our care workers' earnings.  Those who started in any of our organisations after May 2012 are now operating according to a 90% scale because of the lack of restoration in regard to the Haddington Road pay scales.  We have received no funding to restore the scale to 100%.  An individual operating on the first point of the scale is currently earning &euro;120 per month less than someone doing the same job in a section 38 agency or in HSE employment.  With the implementation in 2018 of the next two provisions with regard to Lansdowne Road pay restoration, the differential that will occur during the year will rise to &euro;140 per month.  That obviously has a very significant impact.  As one goes higher up the scale, the impact becomes greater.<\/p> <p>  The money concerned is a huge amount for an individual on a relatively low starting salary.  What is occurring is an incentive to move to another employer.  Ultimately, it affects people with disabilities, and it does so in two very key areas.  First, as Mr. O'Donnell stated, staff turnover is very high.  This is directly related to pay, reduced pay scales for new entrants applied under the Haddington Road agreement, and the decision of the HSE not to pay the increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Since 2012, Rehab has hired 1,167 employees but 40% of them have now left the organisation.  Each year, between 15% and 17% of our staff leave, mostly in year one or year two of their service.  Continuity and familiarity are so important when delivering support services to people with disabilities, particularly those with high-support needs.<\/p><p>Throughout all our organisations, we are in the unsustainable position of going to the expense of hiring employees because, obviously, each person who has left needs to be replaced.  The organisation incurs the costs involved with recruiting and training them and then loses them to a section 38 body or HSE service in the same region and sometimes in the same town, all of which are now funded to pay those individuals more.<\/p><p> The real impact of these cuts and the lack of pay restoration can be seen in the areas of continuity of service provision and the incredible isolation.  Many of the people with whom we work have profound disabilities and have considerable difficulty in communicating.  As an example, with individuals whose only method of communication is non-verbal either through their eyes or facial movement, it can be begun to be comprehended how long it takes a staff member to build a relationship with somebody whereby they can both communicate and that staff member understands his or her needs.  If that staff member changes five times a year, can the committee members imagine the isolation felt by that individual with a disability who goes into a world of silence again because he or she is unable to communicate his or her needs because somebody new has to learn this?  That is the reality.  We can talk in abstract terms about figures but we see how people's lives are impacted.  This is not about us ignoring the needs of people with disabilities in favour of workers getting more pay.  This is about a recognition that we have skilled professional people who are required to bring their skills to empower and support those people with disabilities to live good occupied lives that they themselves determine, but if they cannot communicate because we do not have the skills and the people to engage with them, we are in a very difficult situation.  Sometimes in these discussions we can lose sight of the very human element of this.  In reality, this is what this means if this does not happen and there is that constant changeover of staff and the training costs incurred.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about costs.  Within the not-for-profit organisations, which represent the largest groups of employees who are affected by this, we estimate that the cost to 2018 will be &euro;13 million.  Obviously, that is rising with each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mo Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Breaking down that &euro;13 million, it is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#H00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>No, &euro;13 million is the cost for pay restoration.

I think it is a very pertinent request.  It has been like that.  We have found ourselves in the very unusual position of having to go the WRC on the instructions, it must be said, of the HSE which told us that it would only give consideration to our claims for additional funding if we proceeded through the industrial relations mechanisms and received directions to pay.  It is a very unusual position because we fully recognise the rights of our employees to pay restoration.  To go back to Deputy O'Reilly's point, in the event that pay restoration is received, we are fully committed to passing it on to the employees concerned.  Certainly my organisation recognises that in respect of some employees, we will have to find the money from our resources to pay them because they might not be covered by HSE funding or such like.  We are fully committed to doing that.  It is a very unusual place to find oneself as an employer but it is not one where we have found that we are arguing against the position being put forward because we think it is correct.  However, being unable to comply with the requirements because we are unable to meet the costs is a very difficult place in terms of our negotiation and relationship with the HSE in terms of our service arrangements.  We are carrying deficits to meet those costs so it leads to considerable pressure from both sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#H02700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mo Flynn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Regarding Deputy Kelly's questions, the first thing to say is that thousands of service users, their families and our members are following these proceedings.  This is most important because we want to show that a transparent process is taking place and people can understand that they are not forgotten.  Regarding the description of what is happening with employee turnover, pay, the challenges and the knock-on negative impact on the service user, there is not much we could add to that except to say that our members also feel that somewhere along the line, they are in that sandwich and are being ground down every day in terms of whether they remain loyal to their client and organisation or whether their loyalty will be pulled to look after their family by using their qualifications and going somewhere else.  That is what is happening and that is the kernel of this problem.  Some of our members are saying they feel somewhat ashamed when they move from their organisation.  They are literally working in people's homes.  They are in a community setting.  They know the clients and their families or guardians.  That is the kind of commitment we see.  As everybody in this room knows, to sign up to work in such a service is a difficult decision.  One needs to be a very special person to do that.<\/p><p>The question was posed as to the bloc, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  I think there is a scale of blame for each organisation.  The Health Service Executive, in considering its service plan for 2018, as I understand it, made an application to the Department of Health for a heading that would deal with anticipated pay movements to the sum of &euro;68 million.  We understand that &euro;68 million is not for our members, but that some of that money could be used to commence pay restoration.  In fairness, Ms Mo Flynn made it quite clear that approximately &euro;13 million would kick this process off.  We understood it was around &euro;12 million on the basis of the number of whole-time equivalents who are entitled to pay restoration.  The HSE was unsuccessful in that regard.  We do not know the reason.  We question that judgment.  There are probably other organisations, with members and staff providing public services, which would have expected to be in that particular funding pot had that been granted.  If those moneys had been granted, that would have given confidence not only to our members but \"the industry\", for the want of a better terms, that a process of dialogue could commence.<\/p><p> There is a notion being put around that to restore any moneys will be a complex process.  We want to put on record today that if one looks at appendix A of the submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, it was not such a complex process to butcher the wages of our members and they did that unilaterally on the direction of the Health Service Executive.  That has to be taken into consideration because our members are not confident about the bona fides of the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform or the Health Service Executive.  We must remember also the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health are at pains to say that these organisations are stand alone organisations, that the staff who work for them are not public servants, however, in evidence today, members will see that the Health Service Executive continues to give direction and instruction to these organisations.  One will see that also in appendices B and C, whereby the employer has been instructed by the HSE to proceed to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and to proceed to the Labour Court in order that there will be a civilised approach to addressing a dispute and for the outcome of the Labour Court to be honoured.  In some cases, section 39 organisations, which wish to prevent our members from leaving and going elsewhere, have from their own resources paid some moneys.  In some cases, they have been chastised by the HSE for doing that, because it is breaking away from the party line.  I believe the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for this, the Department of Health has a role in it and the Health Service Executive has some accountability, because at the end of the day, the services are coming back to the Health Service Executive by default.<\/p><p> To lead into my response to the question put by Deputy Louise O'Reilly about a process, let us be very clear, SIPTU, in particular, has commenced balloting for strike action on the basis that we have eight labour court recommendation, processes entered into at the direction of the Health Service Executive.  We expect Labour Court recommendations to be honoured.  The greater economy, employees in other organisations, be they private, retail or otherwise, expect labour recommendations to be honoured.  I suggest that the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas expect Labour Court recommendations to be honoured.<\/p><p> In direct response to Deputy Louise O'Reilly, we have not been offered a viable process to address those issues.  SIPTU, INMO and I understand Unite have Labour Court recommendations that we need implemented.  The communications from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are indicating a number of things.  We will have a process where we will talk the whole thing to death but we will not come to a conclusion.  For the record, the process that SIPTU seeks is to have discussions with a beginning, a middle and an end and is to be transparent and with integrity.  A confidence building measure has to be that we get into a process where there is an understanding that the Labour Court recommendations are key.<\/p><p> A final point that has also been made in some of these utterances from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and HSE is that these cuts did not have to be passed on to staff members.  We absolutely reject that.  They instructed that this would happen.  We are left in this position in trying to defend our membership, the people who work in the service, protect the service and, most importantly, protect the service in communities.  We look forward to generating a process that would basically satisfy the needs of all parties but it has to be viable and that is why we are in the very difficult position where we are saying that on 14 February, our members will be forced into a strike position which is absolutely unprecedented and which is causing a high level of anxiety among our union membership because of the people they serve.  In fact, in some cases, we will have to agree contingency terms that it will be difficult to understand what kind of action we can actually take.<\/p><p> If there are any points I have missed, Chairman, I will have no difficulty in clarifying them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#H02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Can the witnesses confirm for the record, and I know it because I was there at the time, that it was an instruction effectively that pay would be cut, exactly as Mr. Bell outlined?

The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation thanks the committee for taking an interest in this issue.  I will be brief.  Obviously, our members working within the services, and there are various section 39 organisations, are extremely troubled at what is going on.  They are aware of their colleagues in SIPTU who have balloted.  Indeed, the INMO has been involved in numerous third party processes, whether in the Workplace Relations Commission, the Labour Court or with our colleagues in other unions.<\/p><p>We talk about waste in this regard.  Our estimation is that there is a 33% premium for agency staff <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>directly employed staff members.A staff nurse on the first point of the pay scale costs &euro;30,000, in contrast to the cost of &euro;40,000 for the same nurse via agency.  It is a blatant waste of money.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Paul Bell referred to the public health service's reliance on sections 39 and 38 organisations.  It is also the case that in the independent and assisted living sector, 70% of the services are provided by section 38 and 39 organisations, so this will have a major impact in that area.<br\/><br\/>There is a major problem around recruitment and retention for nursing and midwifery roles in the public service currently.  Section 39 organisations cannot compete, and their staffing shortages will be exacerbated.  That will ensure that service provision is adversely affected.  We are all approaching this from the point of view that there are service users who require this service.  It is a service without which they cannot live.  Staff members are deeply invested in the process and in their clients.  They want to provide quality care, but that has been impeded by the issues we have discussed.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the estimates and the costs, we can share the Labour Court recommendations with the committee.  We contend that the HSE's insistence that section 39 workers go through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, the Labour Court, etc., is a waste of their time, because it has acknowledged the difficulties facing the section 39 agencies.  It acknowledges that there is pay parity and pay relativity and, as Mr. Bell has said, it is calling on the parties to engage in the process to try to resolve these issues.<br\/><br\/>It is important that the committee is aware of the pressure coming from our members.  Let us be clear.  Our members, nurses working within this sector, do not want to have to engage in industrial action to pursue this issue, but they are now left with no option.  Next Monday and Tuesday, our executive will have to consider requests from the service to ballot for industrial action.  That is very regrettable, but it is the reality of the situation.<br\/><br\/>Industrial action is due to begin on 14 February.  It is likely that other unions, given their members' angst around issue, will have to respond.  It is important that the committee is aware that there will be further angst in this area.  It is very important that this is recognised.<br\/><br\/>The majority of the questions raised have been answered.  There is a major problem with recruitment and retention in the sector, as there is in nursing and the public service.  As Mr. Bell said, there is a scale of blame.  There is no doubt that in 2010 the HSE instructed these organisations to cut pay.  Then, when the time for pay restoration came, the HSE chose to put the unions through the industrial relations machinery of the State, namely, the WRC and the Labour Court.  This was disingenuous because they did not have the money to pay and, therefore, they were not in the room.  We record our disappointment that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not represented here today.  The committee has already covered that, and we agree with all the comments that members have made on that point. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I must say at the outset that it is ironic that we are having this discussion today.  There was decision in the Cabinet yesterday to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We have had lots of similar news stories for several years.  The Government made a decision that the convention is to be ratified in the next several weeks or the next month, and the committee is discussing something with two aspects.<\/p> <p>  The first aspect concerns what happened eight, nine or ten years ago.  If one is asked to take 5%, 6% or 7% off a budget, and staffing accounts for 80% of one's budget, one cannot say the saving will not come from staff.  It cannot come from anywhere else.<\/p> <p>  We are in this room for one reason.  We are all interested and enjoined in the provision of a public service, regardless of the governance of the entities that provide it.  I have heard the angst experienced by those caring for people who have conditions expressed very strongly by Ms Mo Flynn and Mr. Paul Bell .  They are close to the patients and their families.  I respect that, and I appreciate it being put to the committee.<\/p> <p>  We do not have people with disabilities in the room.  We have heard representatives of organisations on both sides strongly contend that persons with disabilities are the focal point of this issue.  It is worth remembering that this is about real people, people who have difficult lives quite apart from the services they require. <\/p> <p>    I have a few questions.  What happens?  There seems to be a go-slow on this issue, one that is being expressed in different ways.  The organisations represented here are told to trot off to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Meanwhile, the entities that actually control the money bag have not been turning up.  It is decided that the process must be undergone, so those involved dance around it.  That has been going on for a year or more, probably for longer.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the organisations represented here.  In this arrangement contracts are signed, stipulating that in exchange for X, their members must do Y for Z people, and the service must be up to a certain standard.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is rightly scrutinising performance.  What happens if the providers cannot deliver the service?  It strikes me that this cannot be fudged.  There are standards.  The service providers will have to say that they cannot do this anymore.  If that is true, what happens then?  I would like someone to explain that to me.  What happens in the context of the obligation of the State to continue to provide the service to those people?  <\/p> <p>  This issue is a continuation of pay cuts in 2009, 2010, 2011 and so on.  There were organisations that were funded under sections 39 and 38 before that, however.  What is different?  How were things managed prior to that?  I know that was the era of the social partnership.  This certainly did not seem to be the hot and fraught topic that it now is.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#K00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank all the organisations which are working in this area.  There is a huge commitment by staff.  In many cases it is quite a demanding job, and it is important that we recognise that.<\/p><p>Many of the issues I want to raise have already been raised.  My question concerns the operations of the HSE.  Last year it took me six months to establish that the HSE had taken on an additional 2,000 administration and managerial staff from December 2014 to April 2017.  I have made a very conservative calculation of the cost of that.  It equates to approximately &euro;80 million.  At any stage from 2013 onwards, was any suggestion of a <i>pro rata <\/i>increase made by the unions to the HSE?  I have no difficulty with increasing administration staff numbers.  I am talking about an increase in administration staff numbers from 15,000 to 17,000.  Were there any discussions, at any time, of a <i>pro rata <\/i>increase in administrative staff at the same time that people in section 39 organisations would get their increase?<\/p><p>No one has given me the answer as to who authorised the additional 2,000 administration and management staff, while those at the coal face - I mean section 39 workers - were left without any consideration been given to having their pay restored.  This goes back to the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Was it ever raised in the discussions?  Some 2,000 staff did not suddenly appear overnight, rather it happened over a period.  The argument used by the HSE was related to restoring the same staff levels as in 2010, but that does not take into account the fact that Tusla was established and took staff from the HSE.  The figure of &euro;80 million is very conservative for the additional staff employed.  Whether we could have had <i>pro rata<\/i>increases, we could have had an increase in administration and management staff and still looked after the section 39 organisations, albeit not to the same scale.  <br\/><br\/>Many organisations have told me about the turnover of staff that is a consequence of changing circumstances.  The situation where there are more jobs available than people cuts across various sectors outside health care.  Is something else required in addition to pay increases in order to retain staff?  It is a very demanding job.  I raised this issue in private session as it pertained to another area.  The work done by section 39 organisations is very demanding and can be extremely stressful because of this.  Should we look at other issues to provide staff with support, in addition to pay restoration?  That would allow continuity and provide for the delivery of services without staff only staying for six, 12 or 18 months before moving on.  I accept what the delegates have said that if there were better conditions in a section 38 organisation or the HSE, people would not move, but are there other issues we should consider also?  I recognise that the principal issue is pay, but there may be other matters that should be considered.  Some 12,000 people were referred to.  They make a huge commitment.  I have seen the work these organisations do and the demands put on them.  The increase in staff employed in back offices but not on the front line is an important issue.  Has it been raised?  Will we continue to see a similar increase in administration and management staff without looking after those who work in section 39 organisations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#K00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I apologise for not being here earlier.  I had something else on and was unable to get out of in time.<\/p> <p>  As my party's spokesperson on health, if I ever visit a constituency or I am invited by another Deputy, I invariably end up in a section 39 organisation in some part of the country to see at first hand the wonderful work being done, the service being provided, the interaction between clients, staff and the broader community, the voluntary aspect, the level of fiduciary oversight and so on.  They are not platitudes; it is the reality which indicates the importance of section 39 organisations which are embedded in communities in which they provide a service.  To an extent, the State plays hardball with them, knowing that they are a soft target because of their commitment to provide a service.  We see a strong bond between the organisation, the employees, the clients and the community.  I have seen cases in which, for instance, HIQA which has an oversight role in adhering to standards and guidelines frequently visits organisations and might point to deficiencies in staffing numbers, which creates great stress for the organisations and their clients because they do not have the resources to comply with the guidelines and are not being supported sufficiently by the HSE.  This happens to the point where there have to be voluntary efforts, fundraising and so on, not just to meet capital costs but also often current expenditure.  This applies to organisations which are providing services which should be provided by the State.  <\/p> <p>  For all of these reasons, it is distasteful that we have allowed ourselves to get to where we are.  Look at what is being done in section 38 organisations and the challenges in trying to recruit or retain staff.  If we do not get to a situation where there will be parity between the public service and section 38 and 39 organisations, there will only be short-term, transient staff who will come and move on again.  That is wrong for the staff and, equally and critically, the service and those who depend on it.  It relates to the HSE, but I cannot let the Government escape from its responsibility as it is primarily a Government decision that is needed to enable the HSE to start to unwind the cuts and restore parity. <\/p> <p>  The delgates have noted that there have been many Labour Court recommendations.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and the HSE will refer to the complexities in analysing the unwinding of the pay cuts and state they are unsure what the cost will be.  Will they expand on this and unwind the myth because in almost every document I have read from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE it has been stated this is a key issue because of increments.  Will they explain if that is because of requests for back pay or why is it being raised as an issue?  Is it really an issue?  If so, can we address it and, if not, why is it consistently being raised? <\/p> <p>  Representatives of HIQA has been before the committee on many occasions.  HIQA has a very significant and important oversight role, but how can the State or we, as a Parliament, allow a situation to continue where there is a regulatory body which is charged with undertaking various responsibilities and outlines to section 38 or section 39 organisations that there are deficiencies in the service provided and the funder, namely, the HSE, turns a blind eye and states it is not its responsibility whatever?  Section 39 organisations cannot pull the service from vulnerable persons and put them out on the road, but HIQA is forcing them into very difficult positions in terms of the level of fiduciary oversight.  They are being forced to cut corners and try to get around standards because they are not being provided with the necessary funding.  It comes back to my belief the HSE and the Department know that the people who work in these organisations will do extraordinary things to try to deliver a service to their clients.  It is a huge breach.  It is also happening in the home help service.  Half an hour for a person living in a house on a mountainside in west Cork is not much good because the HSE knows that the home help will stay there for an hour.  It is taking advantage of the strong empathy and bond between the service providers, the employees and the clients.  <\/p> <p>  Has there been an assessment made of the cost of unwinding the pay cuts?  Is an element of back pay included?  What have the Labour Court's recommendations been in this context?<\/p><p>We are under a little bit of time pressure so the representatives from the HSE and from the Department will be here in a few minutes.

Deputy Kelleher and Senator Dolan made some points on section 39 being seen almost as a soft option.  The sector brings a huge amount of added value in various ways, through fundraising, through extra voluntary time and through the huge commitment out there in the community.  This impacts on community services that we believe in, and which are so critical to enabling families and people with disabilities who live at home.  Those services are often unseen; it may be half an hour or one hour in the home.  In keeping with Senator Dolan's point, if we withdrew those services or the organisations withdrew, there would be a huge direct impact on people with disabilities and on the employees.  In some cases the HSE would come in and fund the services because they would be very visible, especially in residential situations.  The HSE would pay the pay that is required and bring the terms and conditions.  In some instances it would be a huge loss and impact on families.

Over recent years there were serious staffing cuts as part of FEMPI and this is very hard to recover.  Sometimes it is very easy to say that if we did not have one group of staff we could pay another group of staff.  That is certainly not the conversation we have been having nor is it one we would encourage.  We do not believe that employers - be they the Health Service Executive, a section 38 organisation or a 39 organisation - hire people they do not need.<\/p> <p>  A good point was made on the process of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  We would have seen that for what it is.  We believe it is an abuse of process and that we are being funnelled into this process on the basis that it will occupy a group for a period - be it the employer or the unions.  We say it is an abuse of process because the Health Service Executive, obviously having discussions with the Department of Health and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, would have adopted that strategy.  The problem is that at the end of that process parties are expected to abide by the result.  I understand that in one of the Labour Court recommendations it made very clear its frustration at continually hearing the same case from different organisations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher made reference to the softness of the sector.  This softness is well acknowledged.  Our members are extremely anxious about the fact that they are in this space.  The staff members, not alone the organisations, have the feeling that they are basically being taken advantage of.  When it comes to the crunch or if a dispute goes ahead there will be no big fallout or big issue.  The Government does not understand that the goodwill of our members has literally been sucked dry and is no longer there.  Members have a choice now in whether to leave the employment or stand and fight for the service and for their families.  Deputy Kelleher knows of many such people in Cork and he is supportive of many such organisations in that area.<\/p> <p>  The issue of complexity was raised.  If officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform spoke with me today - which is not going to be possible, not even possible for the members - I would explain to them there is no complexity.  The Department had no issue with complexity when it issued the letter via the Health Service Executive in 2010, appendix A of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions submission to the committee.  This correspondence blatantly outlined the list of organisations and the actions the organisations were to take in order to reduce numbers.  Some organisations may have done various things, but with due respect to all Government Departments, they knew this was coming and they had from mid-2017 to start the process, if they were in earnest.  This is why there is no trust in the so-called \"process\" that is being floated.  It would become a neverending story for our members.  There would be no supervision of the process, no confidence in it and no beginning, middle or end.<\/p> <p>  Our members mentioned in the Labour Court recommendations believe that they have gone through a process and that the wisdom of the Labour Court has said: \"Yes, there are moneys owed there\".  If there are difficulties in providing money, which there are, that is the kind of engagement to be had at local level, for example asking if the cost is too high and if organisations can afford to pay retrospectively.  The union has been very clear that if these are the issues then we would have conversations about phased payments to let the budget catch up.  We have always said that.<\/p> <p>  This is as honest I can be about the issue.  We do understand that this needs to be moved on.  People make things complex when they do not wish to resolve them.  Appendix A of the submission points out how uncomplicated that communication was from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of the situation in 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Bell"},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Can I come back on this as I think it is important?

Did the HSE give any indication at the time of the cuts that section 39s would be treated separately or that it would be difficult to achieve restoration in their particular cases?  Second, are the witnesses aware of any particular reason the HSE might have for slowing the process down at this stage?  Are the witnesses aware of any implications their claim may have for other organisations in the wings?  To the witnesses' knowledge - this is a question for the HSE - did the HSE recognise there would have to be restoration at some stage?  Did it ignore it?  Did it make provision for it in its budgetary submission for the current year?  If not, why not?  To what extent did it make the provision?  Further, the witnesses have been to the Labour Court, which found in their favour.  How does the HSE respond to this other than by bringing them in a continuous and indefinite circle?  Has it had recourse to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, in the first instance or has it attempted to resolve the issue itself?  Has the HSE gone back in a sequence of events to DPER and said it cannot go any further?  To recognise the work done by the section 38 and section 39 organisations, and recognising the increasing demands on the services of their members, now and likely into the future to a greater extent, can the witnesses give me any indication as to what alternative provision the HSE has in its mind if it does not propose to face the realities of restoration and its ongoing and obvious consequent costs?  Lastly, in the event of a shrinking of section 39 staff members in the various organisations, who will carry responsibility for the work that will not be done by the witnesses' membership?

The HSE increasingly engages the latter, and there is obviously a jeopardy in that.

We often make the point that voluntary organisations have historically grown out of communities.  Many section 39 organisations are family and friend associations that were established by families.  The importance of this in the context of national disability policy, which we all welcome, is about participation, social inclusion and connectedness with one's community.  Section 39 organisations in particular, in being borne out of local communities, are uniquely placed to deliver on that.  If we link this to the conversation we had this morning on pay restoration, the role of the social care worker, especially in section 39 organisations, is changing.  It has to change in line with disability policy.  Increasingly they are required to be more community co-ordinators and to make linkages.  If people who have disabilities are to have meaningful lives in the community it will involve people building and making relationships with communities, be they employers, training providers or educationalists.  The complexity of the role of the social care workers employed in section 39 organisations is changing.  This is all the more reason that they should not have to endure this reduction in pay without any hope of restoration.

In the recent D&aacute;il debate on this issue, the Minister of State spoke at length on the role played by voluntary agencies and the efforts under way to address the complex issues that have arisen.<\/p> <p>  Voluntary organisations have been engaged in and have contributed significantly to the provision and ongoing development of the health and social care services in Ireland over many generations.  An important point to note at the outset is what is meant by the term \"voluntary sector\".  Agencies funded by the HSE under both section 38 and section 39 of the Health Act 2004 go to make up what is often referred to as the voluntary sector.  While section 38 funded agencies are not the focus of this discussion, it is important to recognise that they too make a valuable contribution.  The HSE provides a total of &euro;3,576 million to the voluntary sector, with 78% allocated to section 38 organisations and the remaining 22% going to section 39 organisations.<\/p><p>Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 the HSE provides financial assistance to organisations by means of a grant.  Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or ancillary to a service that the HSE may provide.  To put it in context, the HSE provides financial assistance to 2,224 section 39 organisations.  In 2017, the HSE provided funding of approximately &euro;800 million to these agencies.  These grants can range from very large amounts in their millions to much lower amounts of just a few hundred euro.  The services covered by the funding to these agencies include: services to people with disabilities; services to older people; mental health and primary care services; social inclusion; palliative care services; and health and wellbeing services.  The chief officers in the community health organisations have delegated accountability for the funding they release to these agencies.  The profile of the agencies ranges from large, long established and nationally recognised service providers, providing essential services to small organisations that have evolved over the years, providing non-acute services, advocacy or other related support to local communities.  Equally, some of these bodies are large employers and others may rely on volunteers with very few staff employed.  <\/p><p> The HSE is very reliant on section 39 organisations to deliver services.  In the case of disability services for example, approximately 25% of the disability services are delivered by section 39 providers.  Again, for mental health services, the statutory services are primarily provided by the HSE directly but valuable additional services are provided by the section 39 providers which add value and capacity to the HSE directly provided services. <\/p><p> Representatives of these providers also over the years have been involved in working with the State sector to help shape policy and strategies for the ongoing development and improvement of these services.  The HSE is held accountable for the use of public funds and it in turn must ensure transparency and accountability in how section 39 organisations spend the grants provided for services.  The monitoring which the HSE has in place seeks to be proportionate to the nature of the services provided and the scale of financial assistance provided.  We are aware that during the financial crisis, as public spending was reduced, section 39 agencies looked to reduce costs, including pay costs.  Where staff in these organisations had their salaries reduced, there is an understandable desire to see these reductions unwound, particularly where such adjustments are under way across the public and private sectors.  However, in assessing and seeking to address this issue in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE, the Department of Health must be mindful of a number of considerations.<\/p><p> Employees of section 39 organisations in the health sector are not public servants and are therefore not covered by the public service stability agreements.  Staff in these organisations were not subject to the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation, passed by the Oireachtas, which imposed pay reductions on public servants.  Neither do the recent revisions made to this legislation cover employees of section 39 agencies.  As the employer, it is a matter for section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.  All agencies had their budgets cut during the financial crisis and were expected to make savings.  Given that a large part of the budgets of these organisations are spent on pay, the pay budget was a logical place to start.  While it is understood that pay cuts were imposed on section 39 employees, this was not uniform.  Even where pay reductions were made, it is not clear how and when these cuts were actually employed in each case.  We understand that different organisations did different things depending on their specific circumstances.  There may have been increment freezes.  There may have been a stop put to all recruitment.  The number of staff working in the agency may have been reduced over time.  They needed to do more with less and this is what they did.<\/p><p> This issue has been the subject of detailed consideration by officials in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health and discussions have taken place between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health.  The urgency around this issue is also heightened as industrial action is threatened from the 14 February 2018 in a number of these organisations.  It is clear that in order to redress the problem there is a need for a much deeper understanding of the funding position in these grant-aided voluntary organisations, the extent to which pay reductions were made and the manner in which they were applied.  The Minister for Health has asked the HSE to take forward as a matter of urgency an evidence gathering exercise with section 39 organisations to establish the factual position regarding pay reductions and pay restoration.  It is important that such an exercise is properly conducted, having regard to the need to ensure value for money for the taxpayer, given the significant sums involved and the appropriate treatment where the approach taken by agencies differs.  Although this will be a very complex piece of work, it is anticipated that this process will bring about the necessary clarity and transparency and ultimately an agreed way forward for all parties involved.  <\/p><p> The Minister for Health, his officials and the HSE are working to address the matter.  We are committed to doing all we can to ensure there is no disruption to the delivery of health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cody.

Most of the witnesses will be aware of my trade union involvement prior to being elected.<\/p> <p>  Was Ms Cody involved in instructing the section 39 organisations to cut pay?  When the cut was imposed, was it the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that advised the Department of Health to pass it on?  I am trying to figure out where the cuts started from? <\/p> <p>  I am looking at Labour Court recommendations - indeed I was at the Labour Court on similar cases and we really never seem to get to the bottom of who was issuing the instruction, except that an instruction had been issued.  The section 39 organisations were very clear that they were not given any option other than to cut pay.  For the benefit of this committee, it would be very helpful if we knew where that instruction was coming from?  One gets the general feeling that it was coming from upstairs, but we want to know the exact room it was coming from?  Perhaps Ms Cody might be able to explain that to us.<\/p> <p>  We understand that the HSE has allocated an amount of &euro;68 million for what is called pay movement.  Does that include pay restoration in any way, shape or form for the section 39 organisations, and if it does, does it also include a reference to incremental credit, because that is an issue that we need to be cognisant of?  I am looking at the Labour Court recommendation 21.630 which relates to County Wexford Community Workshop, in which explicit reference is made to the public service pay cuts and the consequent pay adjustment, which is the nice word, we were putting on it at the time, when pay was only going in one direction, that the pay adjustment and all the other factors such as incremental freeze that apply were going to have to apply in the case of the workers in the Wexford community workshop.  I think the Labour Court was fairly clear in its recommendations in December 2017 and recommended that the parties should jointly approach the HSE to secure the resources necessary to meet the cost of this recommendation.<\/p> <p>  In the event that they do approach the HSE and I am sure they have, what is the answer to that?  Is the answer \"No\" or is it \"Let's all get together and go to DPER.\"  Will Ms Cody explain that to us?<\/p> <p>  Likewise, the Labour Court recommendation 21.609 for the Irish Wheelchair Association.  The court is very clear on this.  It states that the Labour Court has some sympathy for the difficulties that the employer but they cannot accept that they are the basis for not implementing pay restoration in line with the public service agreement.  It appears to the court that one of the reasons this matter is before us is because the employer feels obliged to do so in order to satisfy an administrative requirement of the HSE, which is its main funder rather than to seek a resolution.<\/p><p>We used to refer to this as \"simply getting a harp on it\".  That is bad practice.  I am not as well connected to people in the court as I once was but I understand there is a path worn to the door of the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission by these agencies.  The same answer is being issued every time.  The Labour Court recommendation from November 2017 &mdash; I believe the chairman was Ms Louise O'Donnell &mdash; is very clear that the court is actually somewhat exasperated over what is occurring.  The delegates might explain the administrative requirement.  What I am taking from the recommendation is that the workers and their representatives are going to the Labour Court to satisfy an administrative requirement placed on them by the HSE in order that they might be able to secure some funding to meet what is essentially a very legitimate claim, namely, for pay restoration.  I have not heard anyone contradict this.  Certainly, the pay was cut in line with FEMPI.  As public servants see some form of pay restoration, there is none happening in the section 39 agencies.  The delegates might advise us on the administrative requirement.  It appears to the court that this requirement is in place.  If what I contend is the case, I would like to hear the justification for it.  It sounds like an absolute waste of the Labour Court's time.  As someone who would have waited for months to get a case into the Labour Court, I believe bringing cases to that court simply to satisfy an administrative requirement is not justified.<\/p><p> The delegates might explain the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this.  Is it that Department that is requiring this administrative exercise - the effective rubber-stamping of the claim?  Clearly, the claim is justified.  The court sees no difficulty with the claim.  It is merely the mechanism by which the claim is settled that is in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#Q00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I wish to continue on similar lines.  The staff of the section 39 organisations are not regarded as public servants but I presume they received cuts to their salaries and wages.  Is that acknowledged?  I presume it is.  There is a bit of a shady area here in regard to how the cuts were imposed on those involved in the section 39 organisations.  Was there a bloc cut to the grant right across the board, reducing it by X amount?  Was any undertaking given as to when it might be restored?  Did the instruction refer to a cut to salaries and wages or did it state \"excluding cuts to salaries and wages\" at the time the cuts were imposed generally across the services in 2010 or whenever?  Was any indication given as to when restoration would take place, if ever?  We have raised this question with other organisations also.<\/p> <p>  Does the HSE recognise that restoration is legitimate and must be dealt with?  Is it recognised that services may suffer, either through industrial action or by virtue of people moving to other employment, thereby leaving service gaps as a result?  What is the HSE's response to that?<\/p> <p>  In the HSE's budget for 2018, is any reference made to the possibility of having to make provision under this particular heading?  I presume provision was not made.  What other areas of a similar nature were left without any such provision, to the delegates' knowledge?  For instance, were there competing organisations of a similar nature that might have been left out of the equation?  On what basis did the HSE conclude that there would be no repercussions?  We recognise the difference between the public and private sectors.  The private sector staff had to receive cuts to their salaries and wages also.  In light of an overall evaluation of the services provided by the section 39 organisations, on what basis was it presumed that the organisations could seamlessly continue to provide services without pay restoration, for whatever reason?<\/p> <p>  Is it recognised that the mortgage and rent payments of people who were employed directly or indirectly through the section 39 organisations might have increased in the past five to seven years?  Was that not a consideration in the determination of the response, either by the HSE, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or both?  I emphasise that point because it affects everybody.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to benchmarking.  Benchmarking occurred as a result of the cost of living becoming so high that public servants, and even private sector staff, could no longer subsist.  Therefore, there was a top-up, which in turn created further problems far down the road.  The same thing is coming to the fore again.  I refer to the aftermath of cuts that were brought to bear on people in the workforce providing a particular service, in this case through section 39 organisations.<\/p> <p>  Who else does work currently undertaken by section 39 organisations, and what will the likely cost be in the event of it having to be delegated elsewhere?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#R00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I have just one question.

She would not thank me, nor I her, if we were back in that scenario again and the court does not like it.  It is clearly of the view that that is what is being done.  Will Ms Mannion tell the section 39 agencies that it was never said to them?

At the outset, all of us around this table accept that the section 39 organisations do invaluable work in providing services for people with physical and intellectual disabilities and in other areas of health in communities across the country.  I am a little confused.  I am asking these questions more to seek clarity than anything else.  Letters have been sent out, including one which reads:<\/p><blockquote>I attach for information a summary note prepared by Mr. John Delamare, Head of Corporate Employee Relations with the HSE [...] I would draw attention in particular to the following 2 paragraphs:<br \/><br \/><i>Section 39 agencies are not encompassed the provisions of the LRA or of FEMPI.  For example, the pension levy of 2008 does not apply to such personnel.<\/i><\/blockquote> <p>I assume that letter is just stating the obvious.

Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#T01700","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#T01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Why would that need to be stated?  Is it just stated to fill up a paragraph or what?  If any other group made a pay claim and its members were not members of the public service, would it state that the pension levy should be part and parcel of the assessment of their pay?  I doubt it very much.  I am surprised that it is in there.  The letter continues:<\/p><blockquote><i>It is accepted that a number of such agencies have had a pay alignment with rates applicable in the public service and that pay rates were reduced in the &quot;crash&quot; years.<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>It is now likely that there will be claims to have pay rates restored in such agencies to reflect the developments that are occurring in the public service.  Such claims should be dealt with in accordance usual procedures applying in such employment, i.e. direct discussions initially, with referral to the WRC and Labour Court if required.<\/i><\/blockquote> <p>From what I can gather, there have been a number of referrals to the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission.  Deputy Louise O'Reilly - who would have a lot more knowledge of the court than I would, although I have some knowledge of it in that I was Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs at one stage - has alluded to the fact that the courts and agencies that address issues of employment and pay on behalf of the State take a dim view in general of people shepherding claims to the courts as a way of prevaricating and delaying discussions.  Is that a policy or is just the case that these claims are ending up there?  Is it a delaying tactic on behalf of some entity - the HSE, the Department of Health or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  It seems that it is almost an unwritten policy to get these section 39 claims for pay restoration to end up in the Labour Court even though it is now acknowledged that pay restoration is, and has to be, part and parcel of any discussions.<\/p><p>On the impending strike and the impact it will have on services, this again goes back to what was discussed earlier with the previous witnesses and was just alluded to in this session.  These are quite labour intensive services.  Most section 39 organisations get very little grant aid in respect of capital development.  Funding is primarily for the delivery of services.  Quite a substantial amount of funding for capital expenditure is voluntary funding.  The organisations will raise funds for capital expenditure and the HSE will step in with a block grant primarily for staff costs and the basic delivery of services.  In some cases as much as 97% or 98% of such a grant can be for staff costs, with 3% or 4% for ancillary services.  When an organisation which has such a high number of staff delivering a labour intensive service and which has HIQA on the other side of the equation looking at the quality of the service being provided gets a letter from the HSE telling it that its funding base is being cut, clearly only one thing can give.  Well two things can give.  Either the people who depend on the service are put out on the side of the road or expenditure on pay is reduced.  Invariably organisations that have a strong ethos of voluntary and community involvement are not going to put their clients on the side of the road, so the only thing that can happen, unless I am reading this all wrong, is that there would be pay cuts.<\/p><p> It had to be pay cuts, whether direct or otherwise.  The only ways to reduce the salary payroll are to remove people from it or to reduce their pay.  If staff were removed, due to guidelines set out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the number of clients using the service would have to be reduced.  As such, it was inevitably going to be pay cuts.  Any analysis that does not accept that as the logical outcome of any correspondence between the HSE and the section 39 staff leaves a lot to be desired.<\/p><p> In that context, what we are trying to do is get the Department, the HSE and the Government to accept that there is now an urgent need for pay restoration.  Further, those authorities must not use the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission in these matters any longer, unless a very detailed and protracted discussion is required.  In general, it should not be beyond the ability of the HSE and the Department of Health to determine how much pay restoration will cost, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should be able to provide funding.  That will obviously be a Government decision.  Surely, however, there should be no more prevarication on the part of the HSE in ascertaining the bill for full restoration.  The HSE should work with the Department of Health to finally determine a figure, which would obviate the need for referrals to the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p><p> I stress this for two reasons.  There is huge anxiety among those affected.  When any member of this committee visits a constituency, one of the first places we will be asked to visit is a section 39 facility, either by party members, other Deputies or colleagues.  That is particularly the case for Deputy O'Reilly and me, as spokespersons for our parties on health.  That is of because of the work the staff members do and the stress under which they are operating.  Furthermore, it is because of the stress that the clients and their families are now under.  They are affected by a continual cloud of scraping and scrimping as they try to ensure there is consistency and continuity of service.  I can assure the committee that service is being provided as efficiently, and in many cases more efficiently, than it could provided by the public service, because of the voluntary involvement and community ethos.  That is putting huge pressure on communities across the country.  The more quickly this issue is resolved, the better.  If we can get the detail on cost from the HSE and the Department of Health, with its goodwill, then we will help the organisations represented here to get the money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  What we want the witnesses to do is to help us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#T01900","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I will start by making a few observations on the statement that has been made by the Department and the HSE.  It is just short of four pages.  It begins with an expression of appreciation of the work carried out by section 39 staff.  From page 2 onwards, it continues with what I would describe as a description and definitions, all of which could be contained in a footnote.  I do not know how they substantially add to the crunch issue before us.  It goes on with what I would describe as vagueness and an absence of detail.  I am quite disappointed with it, and it gives me the sense that the fool is being sent further.  This issue is going to go on and on.<\/p><p>On the bottom of page 3, the statement reads:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;As the employer, it is a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>Every employer knows that.  It is a matter of ordinary common sense and fact.  However, the reason that is not mentioned is that the organisations, in their capacity as employers, and the staff representatives have taken this matter to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Workplace Relations Commission's officials are fed up with this repeated traffic, and they cannot bring the people and entities with responsibility for funding into the negotiation.  Representatives from the HSE have to be asked to appear at meeting, or have appeared at some.<\/p><p>The question of pay restoration has been discussed.  Frankly, I think it is a little bit academic.  We are not involved today in a professional training workshop on human resources or industrial relations issue.  This is not about continuing professional development points.  There is migration of staff, and if the Department of Health or the HSE wish to claim that there is not, let them say that.  There is significant migration of staff out of section 39 funded organisations.  They take up similar work in either section 38 funded organisations or the HSE.  <\/p><p>We all accept that there will be a turnover of staff.  There will be a ratio in any sector.  It will be more pronounced in some areas.  That is often a function of the market.  The market is operating here.  Given their qualifications and background, people see that they can move.  Can I say they should not?  Absolutely not.  Many of us will move.  We have other pressures, from our banks, our building societies, our children, and so on.  These are real issues.<\/p><p>What is the witnesses' estimate of the rate of turnover during the last several years?  What do they estimate it will be this year if nothing happens?  What further attrition, what extraordinary movement of staff from section 39 organisations to either section 38 organisations or the HSE, will we see?  That would be a useful piece of information. <\/p><p>Let us consider the first paragraph on page 4 of the presentation.  It reads: &quot;This issue has been the subject of detailed consideration by officials in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health.&quot;  The previous paragraph features phrases like &quot;we understand&quot;, &quot;while it is understood&quot; and &quot;expected to&quot;.  This is vague language.  We then read that the issue &quot;has been the subject of detailed consideration by officials in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform&quot;.  I welcome this.  Those officials are obliviously too shy to be here today to tell us about all the work they have been doing, and how long they have been doing it.  The statement says that there has also been detailed consideration by the Department of Health.  It is good that officials from the Department of Health are here,  because they can tell us when these discussions started, and how much discussion and engagement has been going on.  That might help us.<\/p><p>The next sentence in that paragraph states: &quot;The urgency around this issue is also heightened as industrial action is threatened for 14 February in a number of these organisations.&quot;  That is the first and only date mentioned in this document.  We will obviously remember 14 February for other reasons.  It is the only date in the statement, and it features not because the HSE, the Department of Health or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have done something.  That date is there because representatives of staff have drawn a line in the sand.<\/p><p>I expect the evidence for the assertions made in that paragraph to be made available to us.  Just to begin with, when was the first engagement?  The witnesses must give us a date, or even a month.  When did the Department of Health engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue?  The organisations, the staff and most important, the people who are not in the room and were not in here this morning, the people who are receiving those services must have some assurance that this is being dealt with.<\/p><p>I do not think that anyone thinks that there is any one simple one-size-fits-all solution.  I know that.  I have been in and out of area for long enough.  I remember when section 38 was section 26 of the Health Act 1974.  I remember when section 39 was section 65 of the Health Act 1953.  That was invented just a few years before I was born.  We all know there are a lot of issues at work here.  However, we do not have any comfort that this is actually being progressed.<\/p><p>Was it not on 17 January that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced in the D&aacute;il on a Private Members' motion that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, had instructed the HSE to enter into a process of engagement?  Subject to correction, I presume that happened prior to the tabling of that motion, or had the Minister instructed the HSE months ago?  When was that instruction given?  If we are to get beyond talk, talk, talk, and I have used the phrase sending the fool further, there is a lot at stake for people with disabilities and for staff and the point was well made by Mr. Bell this morning in that many of these staff work in community settings.  They may be involved in activities in the community.  There are relationships here.  I say that for two reasons.  People find it very hard to walk away from that.  The other point I would make is that relationships with a key worker are critical for people who have disabilities and various conditions to be able to progress.  It is not just somebody turning up every now and again.  How does one deal with that and the issue of people with communication needs?  I think members are quite clear that I am not pleased.  We need to get dates as to when this detailed consideration by officials took place.  When did the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health first sit down?<\/p><p> The final point I will make is that if something goes down in a crisis, such as funding, and there is a pressure on services, I do not think anybody can reasonably not anticipate that when we start to come out of that there are going to be pressures for that to go back up.  Officials in either the HSE or the Department cannot have been unaware that what goes down comes back up, or what goes up comes back down.  This has not come out of the blue.  This was to be anticipated.  We had a bit of a lesson about the differences between sections 38 and 39 organisations but the bottom line is that they are all necessary services.  I do not think the HSE and the Department of Health are giving money to section 39 organisations because they think they are nice and fluffy.  They are giving it because they want the service delivered to a certain standard and to a certain number of people.  It is no different from a section 38 organisation.  I can give members an example of a section 38 organisation and a section 39 organisation, with one operating on one side of the street and the other operating on the other side with the same cohort of clients.  This is going on, but it is unsustainable.  I will leave it at that but I am looking for an answer to the question on when the process started.  In particular, I want an answer to the question on when the gathering evidence and making sure it is all accurate, etc., will finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#U00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Thank you, Senator Dolan.

We heard this morning that up to 80% of the funding goes to salaries in these organisations.  I do not believe that is correct as I do not imagine that amount of funding of the &euro;800 million is being paid in salaries.  Does the Department have any idea of the amount going towards salaries currently?<\/p><p>The other issue is that the figure we were talking about this morning was around 12,000.  We are talking about 2,200 organisations.  I presume the number, in real terms, between all the organisations is greater than 12,000 so I wonder if the Department has a full audit of what numbers are employed, either part-time or whole-time equivalents, in the organisations?  Have we ever actually done an audit and looked for all that information to be compiled?  I know the HSE has that information available in relation to all the staff employed in the various different units around the country, and rightly so.  Could we get the figure of the number employed in all of these 39 organisations?  There is a large number of people working in the section 39 organisations on a voluntary basis.  Do we have any idea of that?<\/p><p>I refer to the cost of the increase.  I raised the question of <i>pro rata<\/i>, across the board, increase this morning.  I know the  employees of section 39 organisations are not considered to be in the same category as HSE employees but, in fairness to them, they are at the front line, they are providing a service and, in many cases, they providing a very difficult service with a huge amount of dedication and commitment required.  We need to look after the section 39 organisations in the same way as we look after the other sections of the HSE.  For instance, I raised the issue this morning of an extra 2,000 staff taken on in administration and management between December 2014 and April 2017.  If there was the same<i>pro rata<\/i>approach in looking after the section 39 organisations, maybe we might have had a little more balance about the number we took on in relation to the section 39 organisations.  That is what I am talking about in relation to funding.  Did the Department look at this issue and say that if we do not look after the people at the coalface, then there will be consequences?  I am not saying we should not have recruited people in administration.  I have no difficulty with that but I think that the same <i>pro rata<\/i>approach was not taken with the section 39 organisations.  <\/p><p>We all knew there was only a certain pot of money available for the health service.  Whether one is employed by the HSE, a section 38 organisation or a section 39 organisation, surely there must have been a policy decision to take the same approach that ball boats rise together.  Instead we seem to have a situation where certain boats were able to rise and others were not.  Has the Department or the HSE looked at that?  Since section 39 organisations did not get an increase in funding in real terms, they were not able to recruit the same number of administration and management staff recruited by the HSE.  On top of that, and I accept there are many more services now compared to 2010, Tusla is now providing services previously provided by the HSE and it took over 500 administrative staff as well.  I am just looking for answers as we look at the health service.  We need to look at all areas in a proportionate way.  We need to look at it from the point of view of making sure that people at the front line, who are providing a very valuable service the HSE itself is not able to provide, are not left paddling their own canoe in trying to provide those services and hold on to staff because they cannot give the same rate of pay.  These are fundamental issues that need to be tackled and delivered on within a very short timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#V00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Senator.<\/p><p>Who would like to lead off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#V00400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I wish to repeat that we have acknowledged, and wish to acknowledge, the work and contribution of section 39 agencies.

As we said in our opening statement, &euro;787 million is what we provided in 2017 as financial assistance to section 38 organisations.  I would certainly agree with some of the comments.  It is likely that pay costs for typical section 39 organisations would be at least 80% of their total running costs.  In some cases the figure may be higher given that they predominantly involve staff, and consumables and external supplies will not be significant unless the organisation has a policy of outsourcing.  We think that 80% or more of the funding we provide is used for pay costs.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Kelleher that it is the case that in many instances sections 38 and 39 organisations fundraise for capital.  The HSE more typically provides revenue costs.<\/p> <p>  There is some conflation around the HIQA piece.  It and the registration of residential facilities were more important issues in recent years than the cuts in 2010.  We have to remember that, as one of the committee members mentioned, there is a certain total pot of available resources to the Government and health.  Within that, a pot is available to section 39 organisations and our services.  What we spend on dealing with the appropriate outcomes of, for example, HIQA inspections often means incurring additional staffing costs, that is, additional pairs of hands in an organisation.<\/p> <p>  A fundamental choice always has to be made, something which is not unique to this situation, between the numbers of staff an organisation wishes to have versus the hourly rate of pay for those staff.  We have been very clear that there is an issue which needs to be resolved.  Our intention is that this process will provide data to allow decision-makers to make calls on the appropriate phased restoration or resolution to this issue.  We agree it needs to be resolved.

I accept it is conflated but it is inextricably linked in another way.  A block grant comes from the HSE to a section 39 organisation.  HIQA then arrives on the scene and says additional staff are needed to provide a service and that the organisation is in breach of guidelines or regulations if it does not do so.  Following that, two things can happen.  The organisation can reduce the service to the complement of staff it has, which effectively means that some of those requiring services can no longer access them, which can have an impact.  Alternatively, the service can try to manage around the situation in a way which skirts very close to a breach of regulations.  That is a fact.<\/p> <p>  Services do not want to send people home or tell people they cannot send their son or sister to a service because the organisation can longer provide it.  Not a week goes by without Senators Dolan and Burke and I making representations on this issue on behalf of families who have been told that services have been cut because of HIQA regulations and inspections.  More often than not, it is down to staffing levels.  Staff pay cannot be reduced any further, because there will be even fewer staff due to the fact they will go elsewhere.  As Senator Dolan said, there is a market.  Qualified nurses, therapists and others specialising in this area will go elsewhere, which further diminishes services.  It is creating significant difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The issue is inextricably linked to pay because HIQA is now stating quite clearly in reports that it is disappointed with the level of training standards of agency or transient staff because organisations cannot retain them in the first place.  Services are being diminished on a continual basis.  When everything else is stripped away, it primarily comes down to the pay of individuals as opposed to the block grants given to section 39 organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018013100002#W00600","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I would largely, but not totally, agree with the Deputy.

That is a significant pressure which services are under and it is a continual focus of our Estimates discussions with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform each year.<\/p> <p>  Beside that pressure is the significant issue of the recruitment and retention of staff for section 39 organisations, in particular the pay rate.

I am a chartered and registered building surveyor and director of The Building Consultancy.  I am chairperson of the SCSI building surveying professional group.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Noel Larkin, who is also a chartered and registered building surveyor.  He is principal of Noel Larkin and Associates and vice chairman of the building surveying professional group.<\/p> <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland is the professional body representing more than 5,000 chartered surveyors in the property, land and construction sectors across a number of surveying disciplines in Ireland.<\/p><p>Our membership incorporates disciplines from building and quantity surveying to estate agents, planning surveyors, property and facility managers and geomatic surveying.  The SCSI is a partner with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, RICS, the global body for chartered surveyors, with more than 180,000 members and trainees around the world.<\/p><p> The SCSI welcomes, in principle, the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill 2017 as a step forward in reducing the timeframe required to seek necessary permits for redevelopment, especially of those vacant and underutilised properties in urban areas.  More than half of our membership base is located outside Dublin and we are aware of the challenges facing towns and villages to breathe new life and vibrancy into urban centres.  This year, the SCSI has placed the topic of the rejuvenation of our rural high street at the top of our policy and research agenda, and this will include highlighting the issues facing property owners when redeveloping their properties.  Derelict, empty and underutilised buildings are a blight not just on rural towns but also on our cities, and we support practical and sensible measures that will improve vacancy rates, especially if they alleviate the housing supply crisis.<\/p><p> We also welcome the concept of a one-stop-shop where competing regulatory requirements such as accessibility and conservation, which can currently create contradictions that cannot be overcome in a practical and economic way, are dealt with in a holistic way.  However, we have real concerns that any reduction in standards and processes does not come at any price to people's safety or deliver any unintended consequences elsewhere.<\/p><p> The SCSI is concerned about elements within the Bill's wording which we believe is very much open to interpretation, particularly relating to aspects of the replacement of the existing building control procedures with the works permit and the interpretations in Schedule 1.  The building industry has come a long way in terms of improving building regulations and building control regulations, and it would be counterproductive if derogations are made available to undermine or deflect from the standards which are properly in place to protect a building's occupants.  The timeframes envisaged by the Bill will be exceptionally difficult to implement without significant resourcing and a specific requirement for sufficiently detailed plans and drawings to assist the panel's assessment of compliance with regulatory requirements.<\/p><p> This Bill proposes a one-stop-shop to consider applications for renovation or change of use applications for existing properties, of which the majority is likely to be of considerable age and built during a time when building regulations were not in place.  Any proposed structural changes to existing buildings impacting on a number of areas covered under the building regulations and already catered for by the existing building control amendment regulations, BCAR, procedures could be compromised due to the tight timeframe proposed and lead ultimately to structural failures.  Consideration should be given to building or structural surveys of these buildings being carried out to ensure that the proposed alterations can facilitate the new loads or alterations proposed for the change of use or redevelopment.  The SCSI is concerned that any general arrangement drawings used to consider an application would be in isolation of sufficient drawings and detail to demonstrate compliance with structure.<\/p><p> Resourcing of the proposed fast-track process to ensure that the proposed changes are workable solutions is unclear at this stage.  The speedier turnaround process will increase the workloads placed on local authorities and therefore will require additional resources before a new expedited process is implemented.  It is also important to ensure that a two-tier system will not develop for the standard of housing being delivered.  The Bill is not clear on the definition of \"relevant professionals\" of the proposed \"panel\" and it also mentions the establishment of a register.  There are already established registers for professionals in this area.  The society is the registration body for buildings surveyors and the RIAI registers architects.  We are unsure, therefore, of the need for an additional register.  We are also unclear as to whether the authorised persons are local authority staff or private sector professionals.  Following a recruitment embargo and the early retirement of many technical personnel, there must be real concern that many local authorities simply will not have the ability to provide this one-stop shop service and will be challenged to scale up to respond to what could be a deluge of applications.  If non-local authority staff are required to undertake this activity, it is likely to place a higher risk of local authorities or indeed the State being held to account for future failures given the apparent light-touch nature of the interpretation of technical guidance contained in the amendments proposed in Schedule 1.<\/p><p> This proposed legislation appears to impinge on established third party rights to comment on or object to any proposed redevelopment.  We are interested to hear how this process will work and what impact the proposal will have on the current statutory planning observation rights.  We are not convinced that the legislation will have the impact that is intended on the creation of housing supply.  With such a high demand for short-term accommodation in many urban areas, renovated properties may be utilised for Airbnb-type accommodation and, instead of being utilised ultimately to assist with the overall housing accommodation crisis, will fuel the short-term letting supply.  The Bill does not appear to contain any restriction in terms of building or project size, nor does it contain any limitation on the number of permissible units to be created by subdivision or refurbishment.  The implications of intensification of use which will impact on parking and local services, which are important planning considerations, may need to be considered in the overall impact study for this legislation.<\/p><p> While it is outside the scope of the Bill, legislators may also want to consider the potential legal and financial implications that these exemption provisions may create.  Will banks provide finance for subdivided units created under these exemptions on the basis of a certificate of conformity?  Will the legal profession view this type of certificate as sufficient for conveyance or other purpose?  Will residential property tax be applied to such properties?<\/p><p> From reading the Bill, the SCSI is concerned that there is not sufficient distinction made between the planning process and building regulations and building control regulations.  We feel that further consideration is needed to separate these two distinct processes and we look forward to working with the Department to ensure that the legislation, when adopted, is fair, fit for purpose and merges properly with the current processes and procedures for the delivery of the built environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Baldwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Baldwin.

I am from RKD Architects and president of the RIAI, and my colleague, Joe Kennedy, is from Smith + Kennedy Architects.  We are both practising architects working on the design and delivery of a broad range of building types - industrial, commercial and housing projects, both large and small, throughout Ireland and abroad.<\/p> <p>  The RIAI has a diverse group of practitioners working right across Ireland and the vast majority of our members work on exactly the scale of buildings envisaged in the Bill.  They are available and willing to help right now with solutions.  A total of 53% of architects are in practices of fewer than five people and a further 28% are in practices of fewer than 15 people, so the work proposed in the one-stop shop system is work in which they would be eager to participate.<\/p> <p>  The RIAI welcomes and supports in principle many of the concepts contained in the Vacant House Refurbishment Bill 2017, including measures that assist in providing residential accommodation to address the housing shortage, the restoration of vibrancy to towns and villages and providing accommodation for the smaller household sizes that are a growing part of society.  We support the provision of co-ordinated local authority meetings where planners, fire officers, accessibility and applicable conservation officers are present.  I believe that point has been raised in earlier debate on the Bill.  We also welcome any measures to speed up the preconstruction approvals process for housing delivery so that the refurbishment of vacant buildings for housing may be implemented urgently.<\/p> <p>  In principle, many of the concepts in the Bill are consistent with previous RIAI recommendations and are to be welcomed, in particular moving away from self-certification by builders or developers and the verification of plans before work commences.  Our comments and recommendations are made with positive intent with a view to improving and strengthening the Bill, increasing clarity in achieving its aims, and ensuring consistency with other complementary legislation.  However, the RIAI has significant concerns in respect of many key aspects of the Bill in its current format which we believe render it unworkable and which we will set out.  That said, we are keen to work further with the committee if requested to address the issues we raise.  I will outline our observations and Mr. Kennedy will outline our recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The primary concern of the RIAI with this Bill is in its potential to undermine the safety of occupants of any new dwellings.  SI 9 of 2014 was enacted to improve delivery of safe and well-built buildings, particularly in the apartment and housing sectors.  Alignment of the Bill with SI 9 is critical to provide proper protection of the public.<\/p> <p>  If the Bill's proposals to compile lists of so-called authorised persons to oversee its implementation are introduced, we will end up with three separate systems for building control.<\/p><p>Those will be the systems under this Bill, SI 9 of 2014 and SI 365 of 2015.  This will be inefficient, confusing and unsafe for the public.  The RIAI believes that, in order to ensure the competency of the \"authorised person\" and the panel of \"relevant professionals and authorised persons\", they must comprise professional, trained people with the competence and experience to carry out assessment of applications and independent inspection of works.<\/p><p> The Bill proposes that the technical guidance documents, TGDs, be revised to indicate how the amended requirements detailed in the Schedule 1 of the Bill can be achieved in practice.  The RIAI believes that this approach will have a number of negative results.  There will be a two-tier system of building regulation and building control, which will be inefficient, confusing and unsafe for the public.  It will be difficult in practice to achieve effective, robust change to the TGDs, given their current complexity.  An effective relaxation of the building regulations, as proposed by the Bill, has serious potential to put at risk the occupants of new dwellings, particularly vulnerable individuals.<\/p><p> The Bill provides for a radical change to the current planning and building control systems.  There is significant potential for unintended consequences.  For example, a worst case scenario could result in the conversion of a relatively small non-domestic building into, for example, six bedsits with shared bathroom accommodation and substandard fire separation and means of escape if proper guidelines are not issued and rigorous inspection procedures are not implemented.<\/p><p> Therefore, it would be prudent to limit the lifetime of this Bill, in a revised format, to two years so that the outcomes may be understood.  At the end of that period, it is recommended that a review of SI 9 and SI 365 be completed and the contents of this Bill and the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018 be aligned.<\/p><p> No reference is made to zoning, vacant houses or vacant buildings in the Bill, nor any definition of what they comprise or the period for which they should be unoccupied to be considered vacant.  The Bill does not provide for first or third party appeals.  It also assumes that local authorities have the resources to deal with the additional workload that will result from it, which we do not consider to be realistic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Turning to our recommendations, the health and safety of the public and occupants of new dwellings that may result from implementation of this Bill must be its primary intent.  The Bill should be aligned with a revised version of SI 9 as envisaged in the Safe as Houses? report of last December.  The draft Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018 support the exemption of vacant town centre properties for change of use to residential under the Planning Acts.  We would support the introduction of that definition into the Bill.  The Bill should avoid introducing a third system of building control to this small country.  Specific guidance to ensure the competency of the authorised person and the panel of relevant professionals and authorised persons should be set out or provided for in the Bill.  We do not support the revision of the TGDs as proposed in the Bill.  The Bill should be limited to two years in order to avoid perpetuating unintended consequences and should be aligned with other relevant regulations at the conclusion of that period after review.

Existing buildings are the most readily available, cheapest, quickest and most sustainable source of housing supply in the short term.  In addition to the estimated 183,000 vacant dwellings recorded in Census 2016, there were more than 28,000 vacant commercial addresses in mid-2017, a national vacancy rate of 13.5%.  Upper floors of buildings in cities and towns were traditionally used for housing.  These buildings exist, do not require infrastructure, have connections to utilities and drainage, and are close to shops, services and public transport.  They are ideally suited to one to three-person households, which is the demographic of highest demand.  Providing housing in existing communities, particularly for people who live alone, gives immediate access to services, generates commercial activity, reduces urban sprawl, supports sustainable transport, consolidates urban regeneration and reduces social isolation.<\/p> <p>  As an aside, and so that members can envisage the scale of building that could occur under this process, the Bill's 500 sq. m limit is approximately the size of two pairs of semi-detached houses.<\/p> <p>  A study by UCC in Cork city centre indicated that North Main Street had 388 residents, with the potential to treble its population within the existing building stock.  Other studies by Dublin City Council and Space Engagers confirm a vast untapped potential in city areas and regional towns where there is high demand.  The UCC study found that, contrary to \"what is sometimes suggested, planning is not the problem here\".  It goes on to read \"discussion with property owners and the local authority indicates clearly that the problem is actually a mix of bureaucracy (the complex\/expensive building control regulation regime) and viability (the difficulty for building owners in securing credit).\"  This is confirmed by the limited impact of the previous living-over-the-shop schemes.  Currently, the living city initiative provides tax relief for owners of residential and commercial buildings, but these schemes are largely concerned with financial incentives and do not deal with the most significant barriers, those being, regulatory cost, complexity and uncertainty.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example to demonstrate the problem in respect of this type of small building.  If an owner of a shop with vacant upper floors that may have been used previously as a solicitor's office or a hairdresser's decides to convert the space to two small apartments, there are three separate regulatory approval processes to do so compliantly: planning, fire safety certificate and disability access certificate.  The three go to different parts of the local authority, have different submission requirements, technical reports and drawings, have separate fees and operate on different timescales.  The owner makes a substantial outlay to prepare these drawings and reports but carries the risk that, if any one of the three is refused, the project cannot go ahead.  The conditions set by a fire officer or conservation officer could be in direct conflict with each other.  There is no formal mechanism to get all of the people together to agree a workable and safe solution and no TGDs for interpreting the regulations for this type of work.<\/p> <p>  If the owner is successful in all three applications, a planning development levy is due.  The owner then engages, and pays fees to, four separate statutory appointments: a design certifier and an assigned certifier under building control, a project supervisor for the design process and another project supervisor for the construction stage under the health and safety heading.  Statutory notices are made to the Health and Safety Authority and the building control authority.  A substantial amount of technical and regulatory information is uploaded to the building control management system, BCMS, for record keeping rather than verification or technical checks.  At completion of the work, another submission of site records, certificates and technical documents are uploaded with a certificate of compliance.  Separately, a statutory safety file is assembled for the owner by the project supervisor.<\/p> <p>  All of these procedures can be triggered by something as simple as changing the use from office to residential, subdividing a room, extending a bathroom or reconfiguring a staircase.  Importantly, the checking of design and inspection of construction is done by certifiers appointed by the owner and who act for the owner, not the State.  There is no independent inspection.<\/p> <p>  The regulatory system has, therefore, become a barrier to compliance.  In the absence of active enforcement, there are widespread problems of illegal and unsafe conversions.  \"Slum landlords\" have little fear of sanction and openly advertise on reputable letting websites.  In one case that was highlighted by RT&Eacute;, 40 tenants were accommodated in ten bedrooms.  Overcrowding, illegal conversions and shoddy construction are putting lives at risk.  Limited resources are available for enforcement.<\/p> <p>  The Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill addresses the shortcomings in previous schemes.<\/p><p>It gives certainty and reduced cost for owners; safer buildings for occupants; and a workable system of approval, control and enforcement for the local authorities.<\/p><p> In summary, there are four stakeholders in this process: the owner; the local authority; the architect or professional adviser; and the future tenant or resident of the building.  The current does not work for any of them.  This system would give the owner one-stop-shop approval, take uncertainty out of the process and allow him or her to have an expedited start on site.  The local authority can streamline its administrative systems, generate flexibility for staffing and on-call expertise.  Importantly, the system gives local authorities consistency and trust in the inspection regime and allows them have preventative controls so that premises are inspected before they are occupied and not afterwards.<\/p><p> Importantly, from the professional point of view, the system allows more collaboration, sharing and upskilling.  Finally, for the future resident or tenant, the system gives the transparency of a national system that works across all of the various safety inspections.  The resident or tenant is not the party that must take enforcement.  A third party, prior to occupation, will carry out enforcement, which is reassuring.  There is also a possible alignment of the various branches of inspection that takes place at the moment.  Again, that will streamline the system and make it more efficient.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hegarty for her presentation and call Senator Coffey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#E00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses before the committee.  I thank them for sharing their views and observations on the Bill.<\/p> <p>  People have referred to SI 9 of 2014 and the recent building control regulations that have been introduced to protect the citizen who may be building or residing in a particular building.  That is all very important and must be acknowledged.  As Ms Hegarty mentioned, the existing housing stock in cities and towns must be prioritised for refurbishment.  Despite the fact that we have all this regulation and construction levels have started to rise again, why have we not seen the activity in the over-the-shop type of premises in towns and villages that we need given the infrastructure and services that exist?  Two reasons that have been outlined are the cost and the bureaucracy associated with such work.  That can lead to two things, ether inaction, which means a premises will remain vacant, or it can mean there is shoddy workmanship.  For example, people may not have engaged the services of professionals like they should, take on the job themselves, hire a small contractor and, literally, renovate the premises and let it without anybody knowing and probably in a substandard state.  <\/p> <p>  I want to identify the best approach to take.  I am interested in hearing further views from the witnesses sat opposite.  Would they rather see an underground renovation system?  That seems to be happening in some cases but not in others.  Would they like the system reformed whereby the concerns about standards and technical documents expressed by the professionals here were taken into account?  Would the witnesses prefer if local authorities provided independent oversight?  It is a fact that in this country local authority inspections of the built environment are not at as high a percentage as in other countries.  We should learn lessons from the Celtic tiger years, particularly well known cases such as Priory Hall and others that had serious infrastructural and structural issues.  Despite the fact, presumably, that the work was signed off by architects, engineers and surveyors we still had problems.  I foresee that the problems existed due to a lack of independent oversight.  For that reason I am of the view that we should support more independent inspections from an independent source, and who is better placed to carry out such inspections than local authorities?<\/p> <p>  Have the professionals experienced the bureaucracy, that we have heard about from their clients, when they engage with local authorities?  Planning certificates, planning permission, disability certificates and fire certificates are required.  As a witness has said, three different timelines are associated with the certificates and permission and three different Departments are involved.  Is it a good proposal to streamline the process and create a one-stop-shop situation in local authorities?  The proposal seeks to reduce the amount of bureaucracy and make it easier for Joe and Josephine Citizen to renovate their property.  There are barriers that we need to address.  This Bill, as written, addresses the matter to some extent.  The bureaucracy is one element and one solution is a one-stop-shop system.  Can the witnesses tell me about their experience of the situation?  Do they agree that bureaucracy is a problem?  Do they agree that a one-stop-shop system in local authorities would alleviate the amount of bureaucracy?  <\/p> <p>   In terms of oversight, do the witnesses, as professionals, support more independent oversight and inspection by appropriately trained and competent professionals employed within the local authority services?  I await the replies with interest.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#E00300","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I was in practice for a long time but I am not currently.  In my experience these systems are very difficult to explain to clients, they are complex and there is a lot of uncertainty.  I mean one must wait for decisions and try to get decisions at the right time.  I suspect that in a lot of cases when people are advised by a professional they go down the route of just getting a builder and do not engage with the system.  Such a situation is a concern.<\/p> <p>  I fully support independent oversight and it is very important that we have it.  It would dovetail into the commitment that 25% of residential rental properties would be inspected by 2021.  Resources have been set aside for the initiative.  This system could be a vehicle for the initiative and, therefore, one could overlap the two.   The final inspection could effectively be a document that is also used for the Residential Tenancies Board.  One could use a resource that has been made available in a more strategic way to do two things at the same time.  The proposal could prove very useful.  <\/p> <p>  Mention has been made that people in the local authorities could do the work.  I understand that there are fewer than 70 building control officers in the country.  Obviously a flexible resource is needed to expand that pool of staff.  Probably the best way to do so is by establishing a panel and framework.  I do not agree that such people need to be registered professionals.  At present fewer than five of the 70 staff are registered professionals because building control differs from the job of a design professional although there are overlaps.  The type of people who might be taken on to do this work might be somebody who is a clerk of works, a retired site foreman, somebody who has worked in the building control industry in the UK or somebody who is an architectural technologist.  A wide pool of people exists that can do this work as, effectively, building control officers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I am very much involved at a commercial level, in almost every county in Ireland, with retail clients.  The Bill makes a distinction about vacant properties.  Perhaps, there is a misconception that the property that sits above a retail unit is vacant but it belongs to a tenant and to a landlord.  We must be careful and explore that aspect a little bit further.  If one goes up and down the high street in any town one will discover that several occupiers have long leasehold interests.  Leasing the upper floor of a premises is complex.  Many commercial occupiers have no interest in residential management.  Their sole focus is to run their business from the ground floor and they have no interest in the first, second or third floors.  That does not mean that the opportunity does not exist.  There is a process and a system involved.  If one of my clients takes a leasehold interest in a property then he or she must apply to the superior landlord for consent.<\/p> <p>  I shall return to the point made about complexity.  Before we even get to a point of making a statutory application we must obtain the superior landlord's consent.  However, an awful lot of properties are held by funds. <\/p> <p>  I take the point the Senator made about individuals.  There are many individuals the length and breadth of the country who own property.  I am sure they would be more than willing to engage in the process of refurbishing the premises.<\/p> <p>  It is important to make a distinction.  Earlier Ms Hegarty made the point that there are 28,000 commercial vacant properties on the register.  In reality, there are complexities around that situation.  When I walk down the main street in my home town I can recognise the vacant properties.  The reality is they sit with a superior landlord who has no interest in the complexity of managing residents.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the process of statutory proposals.  I will share my experience.  We are making applications to the local authority quite frequently and in various counties throughout the country.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, owing to resource issues, we are experiencing delays.

I appreciate the manner in which they have scrutinised the Bill and made known their views on it in order to ensure we will have a Bill that is fit for purpose and will do what we want it to do.  I will not go into it in great detail, but, as others have alluded to, there are cost and time barriers to development taking place and there is also a housing crisis.  We are elected Members of Parliament and it is our duty to help and assist and provide the means and mechanisms to address it.  This is one such way to do it.<\/p> <p>  All of the delegates welcome the Bill and its intent and have acknowledged the need for it, but they say there are difficulties.  Apart from Ms Hegarty, two, in particular, went about providing reasons the Bill should not proceed any further.  We will take on board the recommendations made on definitions, clarifications and resources, as well as the issue of numbers.  The delegates said that in the case of refurbishment works, the number of units within a particular building was not defined.  In no way do we wish to compromise standards, safety or competence.  In fact, I take offence to the implication, regardless of whether it was intentional.  That is not our intention.  As others said, there is provision within the Bill for competent, professional and independent assessment.  We take on board the suggestions made in that regard and will further define it to make it easier for the delegates and the public to understand.<\/p> <p>  It is our intention to reduce the costs associated with certification.  They are too dear and a cost barrier to construction.  With others, I am interested in addressing that issue.  There is a cost of construction issue related to the supply issue and certification is part of it.  Development charges, the cost of finance and VAT are others.  We will do what we can in that regard.  The cost of certification in other jurisdictions is a lot lower and there is no compromise on standards.  SI No. 9 which was referred to is as up-to-date as it gets and we would not deviate one iota from what is being provided for in it.<\/p> <p>  I again thank the delegates.  In particular, I thank Ms Hegarty for her comments.  She set out effectively and eloquently the reasons this has to be done.  On Mr. Baldwin's contribution, I know that there are complexities with buildings and that there are more associated with those in the cities and where trade is greater.  There are buildings in small towns and villages throughout the country that need an opportunity, an incentive and a reason to breathe life back into them.<\/p> <p> The statutory instrument brought forward last week was also welcome, but it must be accompanied by relevant guidelines for refurbished buildings.  It is not fair or appropriate and a barrier to have the guidelines for refurbishment works led by guidelines for new buildings.  It is not and should not be the case.  They have to be separated.  Mr. Browne referred to old staircases and so forth.  We want to make it easier.  If the repair and lease scheme and the incentives associated with it are improved and the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation are taken on board in a future budget, there will be further reasons this could happen.<\/p><p>That will get rid of the complexities fairly quickly as the lad will see there is a buck to be made here, and more luck to him.  There is a provision for an effort to broaden the amount of property available in the market, which in turn would address affordability.  That is our intention and what we want to do.  I thank the witnesses and there are many well-intended suggestions that we will take on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#F01200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Deputy Cowen has probably covered most of the issues relating to the Bill and the presentation this morning but I will comment on some matters mentioned.  Nowhere in the Bill do we refer to new buildings but new buildings have been mentioned by both people in submissions.  This refers to existing and vacant buildings.  With regard to the planning process, the local authority has an opportunity to ensure through the one-stop process that it can deal with planning, exempted planning, fire certification and disability certification.  At no point in this Bill do we want to compromise standards.  That is not the intention or purpose.  Reference has been made to SI 9 of 2014.  We would still conform to fire and disability certification but we are saying that a works permit would have to be submitted under the building control regulation rather than fire, disability or planning exemption certification.  We are replacing it with one certificate but we are not reducing what the statutory instrument requires with respect to fire or disability certification.<\/p> <p>  It has been indicated in a number of meetings now that we are talking about renovation of existing buildings.  Building control regulations relate to new buildings and one cannot have exact guidance documents relating to refurbishment, as one can with respect to new buildings.  Corridor widths would be different and it would be very difficult to convert many existing buildings to new building standards.  We have identified these as weaknesses and it is why we clearly said the technical guidance documents are needed to ensure the likes of corridor widths are maintained, as well as ventilation and fire certificates.  We are not dealing with new builds but existing buildings.  The Bill seeks the technical guidance documents to ensure safety.<\/p> <p>  The Bill also brings independent inspection and it is one of the key aspects.  Most people agree we need to move away from what is there at the moment, where the builder or developer is paying the assigned certifier to sign off on buildings.  We are singing from the one hymn sheet in that this element of building control must be done by independent assessment rather than somebody paying the piper.  This Bill gives the opportunity to introduce this independent inspection.  It is a welcome move in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#G00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of quick comments that I hope can clarify some matters.  There was reference to \"new\" dwellings.  When we convert an existing building into six units, for example, they would be deemed to be new dwellings.  The building regulations apply to existing buildings as well as new buildings; that is other than simple refurbishment.<\/p> <p>  We can take Part M of the building regulations, relating to access for all.  We used to call it the disability provision.  It has two sections, with the first referring to new buildings.  The second section refers to existing buildings and makes the point that one cannot always provide the full requirements under the first and second section.  It is a very practical way of adapting the technical guidance documents without having to have new ones.  It is a simple provision that one would go as far as possible within practical measures, as long as this does not go below the bar of safety.  That is worth remembering.<\/p> <p>  There is also the cost of certification.  We are just finished the first phase of the &Oacute; Cualann affordable housing scheme in Ballymun.  We are working very closely to develop these affordable models.  The cost of certification of those houses is &euro;1,800 per house for design and assigned certification.  In other private schemes we are doing, the cost of certification is between &euro;2,000 and &euro;2,500.  I have not a clue where the figure I have seen in various posts of &euro;30,000 is coming from.  I have never heard of it in the real world where practitioners work.  There is a cost but it is relatively small for what one gets.  The &Oacute; Cualann model is a great way of how to quickly improve the housing stock.

We find that clients are now becoming very dependent on us interpreting technical guidance documents for compliance because they have become so complex.

Authorised persons are defined under the 1990 Building Control Act and there is nothing new in that respect.  I mention it because they are given much legal powers.  An authorised person has the authority to go on a site and take samples of materials, as well as seeking documentation and, effectively, take enforcement through the local authority.  It is a very powerful role.  Certifiers do not have authority to go on a site unless permitted to take samples and get documentation.  They act for the owner, who appoints them, rather than the local authority.  If a certifier sees something that is remiss or about which they are concerned, they could be fired by the owner of the building and replaced by somebody else.  The local authority would be none the wiser.  An authorised person has duties to report and would be involved in the enforcement process.  It is an important distinction.<\/p> <p>  Another benefit of having an independent system is something we are seeing now with the Carillion collapse.  One of the issues in this jurisdiction is that the entire certification process is tied up in contracts.  People due to be paid and to whom moneys are outstanding can now effectively hold certifiers to ransom by withholding certificates through the chain of construction contracts.  An independent system takes that completely out of it and allows the State, in a case where there is a contractual complexity, collapse or a default, to still do the independent inspection, sign off and open the building on the other side.  We could be in a position where certificates would not be available, for example, if people are not paid.  The assigned certifier at the top of the chain would not have documentation, meaning the building could not be occupied.  We have created a very difficult and complex position by putting that into contract and not keeping it independent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I have some observations.

The authorised person regime has been in place since 1992 and is the basis for all local authority building control inspections.  This objection makes no sense.

If anything, it is getting worse.  There are no mechanisms or resources to deal with enforcement.  There are multiple different inspections for different purposes with many overlaps.  All of these inspections have the same purpose, whether it is for these conversions, for HAP, housing assistance payment, or for the RTB, Residential Tenancies Board.  They are all about the safety of the resident, effectively, and personal safety.  Many of them are looking at exactly the same thing such as whether there is a fire alarm, is it working, is there a fire exit or is there ventilation in the bedrooms?<br\/><br\/>It is an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangement.  I have spoken to people involved in these inspections for local authorities.  Some are being done by environmental health departments in local authorities while others are done by building control.  Some are outsourced by the building control department into frameworks with private operators reporting to the local authority.  There is no consistency with the checklists they are using or the fees they are paying.  There is no transparency for people who have a property.<br\/><br\/>For example, if one had a HAP tenant in a RTB-registered converted building, notionally one could have a BCAR, building control amendment regulations, inspection if the two apartments in the building were fitted out.  One could then be on a list for a RTB inspection sometime between now and 2021, which is a different process.  Similarly, one could then have a HAP inspection, which should happen within eight months of a tenant moving in but often is longer.  This could impose a third checklist on the landlord to do work or the HAP payment will stop.<br\/><br\/>The potential of this authorised person regime would give a local authority a panel of people who would be appropriate to the needs of whatever the inspection was and who could be ticking off the same list.  In some cases, it might be checking if there is a fire alarm and a fridge in the kitchen.  In other cases, it might have to call in a fire officer to look at something more complex.

It arises from competing intentions of different parts of building regulations, particularly the near zero energy building, NZEB, standard, which gives us highly-insulated, airtight buildings.  The ventilation regimes are difficult to impose on residents and occupants.  It is the fastest growing area of legal action in France and the UK at present.  It is even more challenging when one is converting a 1920 two-storey shop.

I will re-emphasise, and am sure that everybody else said this at the start of their comments, that those of us who are sympathetic to this legislation do not in any way want to compromise fire safety or building standards.  These sessions are very useful because they allow us to clarify and identify problems which, potentially through friendly amendment on Committee Stage, we might be able to resolve.  We also share a desire to see a faster turnaround of vacant properties, particularly above shops.  The current system is not achieving that for us.  The discussion we are having today is not unlike the discussion we had last week about the Government's planning regulations with regard to exemptions, because standards are paramount for us.<\/p> <p>  As I listen, I wonder if part of the solution to this problem is not unlike part of the solution that many of us came to during the report on building control issues, which is that we are not really looking at a potential third inspection regime but at the old inspection regime with the new standards that come with BCAR.  If there is some way to merge those two in a cost-effective and speedy way, that might be the way to do it.  For example, clarifying the legislation about authorised persons might be a way to do that.  Having a greater level of BCAR-type inspections by the authorised person worked into the legislation through amendment might be another way.  Many of us are of the view that we would like assigned certifiers to continue operating under BCAR but not to be directly employed by the builder or developer, but essentially as authorised persons by the local authority, with the cost to be borne as it currently is.  If all of that were to be done in the context of this legislation, which would not require substantial amendment, one could end up with the best of both worlds, which is a faster system with no questions on any of that.  Maybe we can consider that as we go.  Perhaps people have suggestions on how some of that could work.<\/p> <p>  The clarification of the point about the level of technical information that would be required in this Bill is important.  We might look at clarifying that in the legislation because that is clearly the intention of the drafters.  If that is where this conversation ends, I presume, if it is done right, that it would satisfy many of the concerns of the people on this side.  My question relates to timelines because we obviously want to do this all more quickly but without compromising.  Mr. Baldwin mentioned timelines.  Does he have a notion of what a more appropriate timeline would be, particularly in the context of what I have outlined as a potential inspection regime and merging the two processes, or is that something he could maybe think about and come back to us on?

There is no cost to the local authority to do this independent inspection because it has to be done anyway.  The other point, which was mentioned earlier, is the panel at local authority level.

We deal with housing supply services, support local authorities in housing management, conduct research, support approved housing bodies, operate the regional and national mortgage-to-rent schemes, co-ordinate national housing policy for people with disabilities, provide procurement advice and support for local authorities and approved housing bodies, operate the pyrite remediation scheme, regulate approved housing bodies and provide advice on a wide range of issues, including policy development, technical advice and project management.<\/p><p>We have been very vigorous and very active.

These roles are guided by our published vision, mission and values.  Identified as our core values are independent influence, quality expertise, innovation, a focus on solutions, a respected reputation and collaboration. They are outlined in detail in the attachment.  One of my roles as chairman is to meet the Minister periodically to discuss our performance.  It is my practice at such meetings to advise the Minister on housing issues and priorities.  I usually do this the first time I meet a new Minister.  I have given a typical briefing in appendix 4.<br\/><br\/>Since I took up my role, the agency has expanded in scope and scale considerably.  An attachment sets out how much it has grown.  I notified the Minister in 2016 that I would not be available for re-appointment because of my belief that the continued expansion of the agency would demand a chairman with deeper skills in financial and human resources management than I possess.  To this end, I instigated and implemented a succession programme that resulted in the Public Appointments Service identifying and recommending replacements, who proved to be unavailable when offered the position.  As a result, I agreed in December 2017 to continue in the role until a replacement could be appointed.  The Minister assures me the appointment process is proceeding as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>On homelessness and my recent comments in the media on this matter, I draw members' attention to the fact that, prior to stepping down as chairman, I agreed to give one press exit interview.

I will single out some of them and Mr. Skehan may comment on them when I am finished.  I understand he has given a series of interviews.  He targeted homelessness charities and said there were too many of them.  There is due process here and I would like Mr. Skehan to correct me when I am finished if I am wrong.  He referred to the Apollo House activists as misguided.  Why does he believe that?  Does he still believe that?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Skehan said the homelessness crisis is normal.  This is my understanding of his commentary.  I have read and played back some of his commentary, and this is what I have taken from it.  He said people are gaming the system and declaring themselves homeless to be prioritised on the housing list.  That may or may not be the case.  I am not disputing it but I just want to tease it out with him.  He might also refer to Government policy.  A certain amount of Government policy stated the homeless were to be prioritised and that there were to be quotas in each of the local authorities.  Many people found the phrase \"gaming the system\" very offensive.  Many discussed this with me and said they found it exceptionally offensive that somebody with Mr. Skehan's responsibility was saying people were gaming the system.  When did it come to his attention that people were gaming the system?  If he believed that, what did he do about it?  In some ways Mr. Skehan's name became a byword for the idea &mdash; this is important &mdash; that there is official indifference to the human cost of homelessness.  That is what some people thought.<\/p> <p>  I want to pass on what I picked out of the commentary.  I found Mr. Skehan's remarks offensive.  I am not without a home.  I met people who are homeless, people in hospitals and people who worked in the sector, and they found the comments offensive, particularly given Mr. Skehan's position.  Will he clarify whether he made the comments?  If he did, he clearly gave a lot of thought to them.  I have a lot of respect for Mr. Skehan and have attended conferences that he addressed, so I believe he would have given some thought to his comments.  Does he still stand over them?  If so, is he fit to stay in office at this juncture?  That is a view of mine on which I would like him to respond.

At the risk of false flattery, I will continually draw the Senator's attention to the wisdom he is continually told about in this committee by Deputy &Oacute; Broin concerning the importance of having policy based on evidence, the avoidance of anecdote and the avoidance of emotion.  Am I correct in my paraphrasing?  The importance of doing what I describe rests on a systematic analysis of whether practices that are reputed by many people to be taking place are, in fact, true.  If I am arriving at this committee, I am doing so to say to members that one of the really important pieces of work they must do is to find out whether these things are true.  As the Senator said, I have been extremely careful in my words.  I was extremely careful not to say that these things are happening but that they may be happening and should be investigated.<br\/><br\/>To take it further, I draw the Senator's attention to the following two statements that appeared at the same time.  The first reads:<\/p><blockquote>There may well be a small proportion of people 'gaming' the system, but there have been chancers since time began.  Look at insurance fraud, for instance.  But if it is happening, I'm certain it's at a tiny proportion.<\/blockquote> <p>The second reads:<\/p><blockquote>No matter what system you have, whether it's a social welfare system or a tax system or a housing system, some people will try to scam the system.  That's just a reality.  I'm absolutely sure there are some families who are declaring themselves homeless when they may not actually be homeless in order to jump the queue.  But that's a tiny, tiny percentage of those families who are actually declaring themselves homeless.<\/blockquote> <p>The first of those remarks is by Mr. David Hall, director of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  I will provide the committee with the specific reference to that article.  The second comment, on people who are trying to scam the system, is by Fr. Peter McVerry.  These are exactly the same pieces of advice that I provided when I said this may be happening, that people may be doing this, and that if it is happening it should be investigated.  Those are the actual words.  I know this is a busy committee so I will not be tedious and read the article out to the members.

That is the matter of people taking offence at the things I have said or otherwise.  Is it completely clear where that has come from and where it is going?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the questions asked about describing homelessness as normal - I am sorry, as I keep picking on Deputy &Oacute; Broin - one of the important functions of this committee is to base policy and decisions on evidence.  One of the most normal processes in all fields of human endeavour, but especially in the field of public policy, is to benchmark so that we can know how we are doing compared with other places or sectors.  Saying that our homelessness issues are normal is a call to examine the ratio of people who are homeless in various categories in Ireland compared with other EU member states overall, other member states in similar circumstances and other parts of the world.  That is what normal means.  It calls on people to recognise something about the levels of homelessness in Ireland.  To use my complete statement, I said that homelessness was a dreadful thing to befall anyone, but we must recognise that it occurs everywhere in the world for more or less the same mix of reasons.  It is only by examining that and seeing it in this context that the committee can start to direct the Oireachtas's attention towards policies that are likely to be effective as opposed to those that are merely based on anecdote and emotion.  That is the point of drawing attention to the issue.<\/p> <p>  I cannot read my scrawled handwriting, so if I have overlooked something that the Senator asked, please forgive me.  I have referred to \"normal\", gaming the system and people taking offence.  I was also asked whether the Minister summoned me to express his displeasure.  On the contrary, the Minister made a public statement that chairpersons were appointed and valued for the provision of independent advice.  He may or may not agree with that advice, but that is our role, particularly as an agency that is specifically mandated to be independent and to tell people what they need to hear, even if it is not always what they want to hear.

I will make a couple of initial comments.  I am a strong defender of free speech.  People have a right to express their opinions and I would not try to curtail that.  Likewise, the rest of us have a right to respond to those publicly.  People in public bodies should express their views even when they do not necessarily coincide with the views of politicians in opposition or government.<\/p> <p>  When I commented on this matter over Christmas and the new year, I tried to be measured and accurate in my remarks regarding what Mr. Skehan said as opposed to what some misreported him as saying.  I have no difficulty with his description.  However, there is a difference between Mr. Skehan and Mr. David Hall and Fr. Peter McVerry in the sense that Mr. Skehan chairs a body that is tasked with providing independent and evidence-based research to the Government.  Regarding potential strategic presenters in the homeless system, his organisation has had a great influence on a significant Government decision.  The input of Mr. Skehan and other members of the agency, be they on the board or staff members, is potentially significant.  I will revert to this matter in a moment.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to two of Mr. Skehan's comments.  Like many of those in the homeless sector, I believe that there are too many homeless organisations.  A reason for this is that the failure of the State over a long time has meant that the voluntary sector, often charities and religious organisations, had to step in and provide services.  Mr. Skehan stated that voluntary service providers should have performance indicators.  They already do.  It is required by their service level agreements.  Their reporting requirements have become onerous.  The people in the voluntary sector with whom I spoke had no great difficulty with Mr. Skehan commenting on the number, as there are more than 40 homeless service providers in the city and county of Dublin, but with the specific issue of the existing performance indicators.  Indeed, it has just been revealed that another State agency was trying to insert in its service level agreements additional elements that would have been detrimental.<\/p> <p>  Normal, as I understand the word, has a tendency to mean something that is not exceptional.  There is a normal, common or typical way of doing things.  While there is no doubt that every modern industrial society has homelessness, the levels of homelessness that we have experienced in recent years, especially child homelessness, are exceptional.  This is not my view, but the view of the FEANTSA cross-country comparison and the OECD study.  The concern that many of us had when the word \"normal\" was used was that it sounded like a suggestion that this was not exceptional and that it was typical.  If Mr. Skehan's intention was to say that, on the basis of homelessness being a problem in many places, it was not unusual in Ireland, I would have no difficulty.  However, that is not how it came across in the interview.  For some people, including me, it sounded like the old Christian saying about how poverty would always be with us and we should just accept it.  That is not Mr. Skehan's view, but I want to convey to him that this is how it came across in the radio interview.  It caused difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the issue of people possibly gaming the system.  Most committee members have conducted many interviews and left unhappy with how our phrases were presented or kicking ourselves at our choice of words.  We do not all get it right all of the time, particularly in a two-hour interview.  However, I have a specific concern because, after Mr. Skehan's interview, I felt that he had crossed a line in his position as chair.  I am on public record as saying that I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Skehan, have a good relationship with him and believe he contributes positively to our housing debate.  The Housing Agency undertook a study of this issue at the Government's request during the review of the 50% priority allocation.  I read the report unofficially at the time and later when I received it through a freedom of information request.  While it states that people may be gaming the system on the basis of anecdotal evidence, it presents no evidence whatsoever to support the idea that is it happening in our housing system.  It is a report that Mr. Skehan's body produced and of which he is aware.  There has been a considered discussion on this issue among the Dublin local authorities, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive and Mr. Skehan's organisation for a year.<\/p> <p>  I was surprised, but not that Mr. Skehan had said this at the start of 2018.  Rather, given that this research had been done and no evidence was provided, that we had had this debate and that the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive subsequently stated publicly its belief that people were not getting through the system as a result of strategically presenting, it was unwise even to suggest that people might have been doing that.  It plays into a public narrative - Mr. Skehan is not the narrative's fault - that these people are not genuine, are queue jumpers and are trying to get into a council house quicker.  Mr. Skehan presented his remark as a theoretical comment as a social scientist would, but it was a bad choice of words, especially given the current context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#M02300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1517405400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>It has caused deep hurt.

It should be evidence based.  If he or his organisation has evidence to suggest that this actually is a problem, then we have a conversation.  The one publication we have access to - we had to get it by FOI - does not present it.  That is why I think we are in difficulty on this remark.

First, I home in on his concern about crossing a line in terms of my role in the agency.  The first thing to bear in mind is that I am chairman of the board and not a member of staff.  My job as chair and our job as the board is to challenge our executive - sometimes to say, \"Well done\", sometimes to say, \"Try harder\" and sometimes to say, \"Look harder.\"<\/p> <p>  I teach and one of these issues - the one the Deputy is raising here - is the absence of evidence.  Absence of evidence is a very specific thing we teach our students.  There is an old phrase that the absence of evidence is sometimes not the same thing as evidence of absence.  We teach the students that by giving them the following example.  We are in a room, I send all the students to the window and ask them to look out on the lawn and tell me if there is an elephant on the lawn.  They come back and say that there is no elephant, which is excellent and well observed.  I then ask the next student to go to the window and tell me if there are ants on the lawn.  The student comes back and says: \"I don't know; I can't see any.\"  To which I respond: \"Well, maybe you need to go out and look harder.\"<\/p> <p>  This is the category of argument I am putting to the committee here.  In my role in the agency, people send me stuff.  I will read out three or four examples from different aspects of stuff that people send me that give me the grounds for making exactly the remarks the Deputy is so concerned about.  If they are true, we should all be concerned about it and if they are not true, we should all be relieved that they are not true because they are precisely that class of data he referred to as anecdote and no basis for policy.

In that case, I will synopsise it because we do not have a huge amount of time.  Essentially they say that there are three case studies that would be of assistance on the basis of the personal experience of the councillor.  To be really clear, I went back and checked this with the county manager afterwards and the county manager confirmed that these are cases.<\/p><blockquote>Case 1<br \/><br \/>A young woman who had been living with her father in Council accommodation contacted me in the latter half of last year.  A problem arose, as her father had no permission to allow people stay with him.  She found herself becoming homeless and contacted myself and other Councillors in our electoral area.  The problem was resolved and the Council advised she could remain living with her father.<br \/><br \/>She was most disappointed at this... because of the difficulty with her father he would no longer allow her to live with him.  The council agreed to provide emergency accommodation in a nearby hotel.<br \/><br \/>She only stayed in the Hotel room for one week and then moved back to her family home and now uses the hotel room to meet her partner a few nights a week, but as far as she is concerned she is now living in emergency accommodation...  This lady is counted in our homeless figures and nothing could be further from the truth.<\/blockquote> <p>This is the information I am being sent.  I would be remiss in my role if I did not challenge my executive to find out if this is true.<\/p><blockquote>Case 2<br \/><br \/>A young lady approached me two years ago who told me she was homeless and sleeping in her car with her three children under the age of 7.  She had been living in a council house with her father and claimed that he was being physically abusive to her and her partner and they had to leave the home.  I asked if she could stay with her mother who was in another council house close by and she told me she had not spoken to her mother in years and that there was no chance of her mother agreeing to this.<br \/><br \/>I attended the Council offices with her, her partner and her children.  It was impossible for the meeting to be held, as the children were [very noisy]...<br \/><br \/>[I arranged a meeting the following day] To my surprise she called her mother who arrived in her car and took the children home and arranged with her daughter to see her at the house later, when I questioned her about what she had told me in relation to her mother she said [that]... this was the best way for her to enter emergency accommodation.  She had a council house six months later.<\/blockquote> <p>This is what I am being told.  This is what I am being asked to draw to the committee's attention.<\/p><blockquote>Case 3<br \/><br \/>Some months back at the launch of yet another fundraising drive by the homeless charities I watched a video... of a young child struggle with the steps of a B&amp;amp;B because he was in temporary accommodation.  It was an appalling site [<i>sic<\/i>], and one that was viewed over 500,000 times on you tube.<br \/><br \/>When I realised that this child was a member of a homeless family from Fingal I approached our executive and sought an explanation as to how this was happening on our watch.<br \/><br \/>It was only then I learned that this family had been offered alternative accommodation, including a brand new 3 bed specially [adapted] home in a new development and refused it as it was a ten minute bus journey from where they had hoped to secure a home.<br \/><br \/>The same family also refused a transfer to a hotel nearby where they could have had a room [adapted] for people with special needs, as it was not close enough to the mother&rsquo;s family home.<\/blockquote> <p>This next piece comes to the heart of looking harder for evidence.<\/p><blockquote>When the facts in this case were brought by me to RTE and Independent Newspapers they both investigated and confirmed the story, both indicating they were anxious to run it and both then reverting and advising me that it was too dangerous legally to deal with the story.<\/blockquote> <p>I will not deal with the rest of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#N01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I think that answers the Deputy's evidence question.

This is very important and in some senses I am even more concerned now than I was at the start.  Again I will be as measured as I can be.  Third-party accounts of very complex family situations are not evidence.  I am not disputing that the person who sent Mr. Skehan that may believe that.  However, that is not evidence of people gaming the system.  That is somebody's interpretation of a set of circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Skehan's first quote, for example, was from a young woman on social media.  None of us knows from that account if this person was made homeless from a notice to quit from a landlord, if there was abuse in the family relationship or other family circumstances.  I appeared on a radio show recently talking about this and a very similar social media post was used by an interviewer.<\/p><p>The implication is that this person is not genuinely in there when it is clearly not demonstrated from the information that Mr. Skehan has given.<\/p><p> I will go back to what I say.  I hear all the time all sorts of things.  I hear that a mother with one child can easily get a three bedroom house in the local authority area in which I live.  That is not true.  I go and check it out whenever I am told this and I look at the complexity of the situation.  When somebody presents as homeless and Mr. Skehan should know this, given his position, there is a very rigorous test, there is documentation required.  They engage with professional local authority staff at the front line who make very difficult decisions every day to allocate very limited volumes of emergency accommodation.  If it is suggested that even one family slips through that process, we are suggesting that a wrong call was made by one of those staff.  Likewise, if somebody is in emergency accommodation and they do not stay in that emergency accommodation of a single night, that emergency accommodation is taken away from them straight away by the local authority, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive.  I have no difficulty with somebody who might be in bed and breakfast accommodation in a hotel going back and staying with family and friends for some relief.  In many of these emergency accommodation locations, one cannot spend the day there.  There is nothing in what Mr. Skehan has said that provides any evidence of gaming the system.  A councillor and another individual informed Mr. Skehan that they think there is a problem.  All I am saying is that this is the report of his organisation.  The Housing Agency looked at the matter and while it is said there may be a problem it provided no evidence for it.  If Mr. Skehan is concerned that the Housing Agency's report is not good enough, in the first instance it should be his responsibility to get the Housing Agency to do proper research and produce a new report.<\/p><p> When Mr. Skehan comes out as the Chairman of the Housing Agency - and I understand the role of the board - he is perceived to be a spokesperson for that organisation because the ordinary punter on the street does not know the difference between a board member and a chief executive officer.  When one uses the words \"gaming the system\", even though there is a caveat before the words, it sends out a signal that there is a big problem.  Nothing of what Mr. Skehan has said suggests there is a problem.  There may be, there are some people who think there are, or there is some speculation about problems.  I think it was incredibly ill advised.  I say that with the greatest of respect to Mr. Skehan.  In the period that Mr. Skehan remains as chairman of the Housing Agency, I ask him, given the vulnerability of families who are in emergency accommodation and the staff dealing with them on the front line, to please be thoughtful in how he uses these words.  For a social scientist in a university lecture, most of what he said is fine, but back out in the world of families dealing with homelessness and workers dealing with the stress of trying to respond adequately, those same rational, logical social scientist conversations, can be deeply hurtful and can feed into a narrative that many of these people are in there to short circuit the long housing waiting list and are turning down properties.<\/p><p> I do not have a difficulty with a person turning down an offer of accommodation, if the reasons are legitimate.  Nothing in what Mr. Skehan has said has given me any facts from the original source that those refusals might not have been legitimate.  I have dealt with two homeless families, one family with a child with special needs in particular on whose behalf I fought with them tooth and nail because the offers of accommodation they were given were so wholly inappropriate for them, that I think the council made a mistake.  The council eventually agreed and they were put in long-term accommodation, appropriate for their needs.  Again, we need to be careful that we do not feed, unintentionally, a whole set of prejudicial narratives about what is going on.  If those few emails and posts are the basis of Mr. Skehan making the claim, that is very disappointing, given the fact that he is a very smart man who understands the need for evidence and the organisation which he chairs, the Housing Agency, which has done a report has not provided any.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#N01600","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for raising the issues and giving me the opportunity to address the most important of those points, which is that the report, to which he alludes, was prepared two years ago.

As soon as the new initiative came out to allocate the proportion of social housing to homeless as was laid out, we immediately had red flags raised the length and breadth of the country by our client housing authorities, saying that this could, unwittingly, give rise to people seeking to move from a conventional housing list into an accommodation list.  Members will agree that this is the time we are talking about.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin, as ever, is correct.  There was no evidence at that time that this was occurring and that is why no evidence was included in that report.

When somebody is in homeless accommodation, emergency offers of accommodation are not made on the same basis, so that very often somebody will be offered accommodation not in their area of preference but so far away from their area of preference and family support networks that it is not an appropriate offer.  That is an important distinction to make.  Increasingly, and my own local authority has two areas of choice, so it is not like people get to choose a housing estate, one has a choice between either north or south of the Naas Road.  That is why for example there are occasions where somebody is in emergency accommodation, they get an offer of accommodation but when one looks at the details of the family and the offer, it is wholly inappropriate.

Mr. Skehan is absolutely correct, the report dates from 2016 and the logic of the report was the dramatic rise in the increase in the number of families presenting as homeless.  What he did not mention, but I am sure it was an oversight, was that this was also the period when we had a dramatic increase in the number of landlords increasing rents, but before we had an adequate response from Government.  There was a crisis in the rental sector.  The consequence of that report, notwithstanding the fact that no evidence was provided for strategic presenters, was the 50% priority allocation was allowed to lapse and in all four of the Dublin local authorities, the 50% priority allocation dropped to a range of levels from 20%, 25% and 30%.  What is very important is the number of families presenting as homeless, notwithstanding that the original suspicion that led to the call for the report was the rise in this number, but the number of families continued to rise in spite of the fact that the priority allocation fell.  That was because of the rental crisis continuing to spiral out of control.  We are now in a situation where many local authorities who have never applied a priority allocation system are seeing very dramatic rises in family homelessness.  None of that is conclusive evidence, but all of this information is very important to the context.  The suggestion, and it is only a suggestion contained in the 2016 report that there is a link between the number of family presenters and the availability of a 50% priority allocation is not only inconclusive but is counter proven by the fact that the increasing levels continued after the withdrawal of the 50% priority allocation in Dublin, and in those counties that have never had a priority allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#O01500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I will bring Deputy Barry in and Mr. Skehan might respond to both.<\/p><p>I would like to ask Mr. Skehan about what his presentation described as \"recently articulated views\".  I had intended to focus on recently articulated views to the effect that homelessness is normal, and that people are gaming the system, both of which were comments made last year.  However, I will now ask about views articulated far more recently than that.  What Mr. Skehan has said in this room in the last 30 minutes does not just continue down the path of his comments about the normality of homelessness and gaming the system.  It has actually brought things to a point of even greater seriousness than when the invitation to attend this committee was first extended to him.<\/p><p> I have listened to the examples Mr. Skehan has listed, and I have heard scraps of information.  I have heard hearsay.  I have not heard anything that would constitute real, hard, serious evidence for the line of argument he is making.  I have heard people who are in very difficult and vulnerable positions being wheeled out as examples.  Mr. Skehan mentioned not one but two young women who are in difficult relationships with their father.  For one of these women, physical abuse was part of the issue. <\/p><p> Mr. Skehan has done this while engaged in a particular action, and that action is to defend his position from the criticism he has received in recent times.  The effect of his comments is to add fuel to the fire of a narrative that is out there, pushed by sections of the right-wing media.  I refer to the old Victorian idea that there are the deserving poor on the one hand and the undeserving poor on the other.  His comments add fuel to the fires of prejudice and backward attitudes towards people who find themselves in a very difficult position within our society.  I would like to deal with some of the specific points he has raised. <\/p><p> The minutes of Fingal County Council were mentioned.

To anyone here who is a public representative, who has worked as a Deputy or as a councillor in a local authority, that figure would not be a shocking one.  We deal with people in those circumstances all the time.  There can be any number of good reasons, which would stand up, for someone in homeless circumstances to refuse the offer of a house.  I had many debates on my old council, Cork City Council, when conservative politicians said a certain woman would not accept an offer because it was too far away from her mother.  They would make a big issue of that.  The reason they would make a big issue of it is that they live in a different world to a lone parent who is on a low income, in a stressful situation and trying to improve their situation by getting a part-time job and earning a few bob, but cannot afford a babysitter.  They need support from relatives and family.  People who do not live in communities like that, who live in a different and more affluent world, do not understand that these are the realities of life for many working-class people with low incomes.<\/p> <p>  I have seen people turn down the offer of a house because there is someone living across the road or around the corner who has been threatening or violent towards them in the past, or is a known drug dealer with whom they have had difficulties.  These are the realities of life for many people.  I suspect that there are people high up in the Government, the Civil Service and, with respect, in the Housing Agency, who do not understand the realities of life that people are struggling with in situations such as this.  <\/p> <p>  I refer to the example Mr. Skehan gave involving people with difficult situations with their fathers and physical abuse.  In my experience, difficult family situations show the opposite to the narrative of people gaming the system.  For example, how many times have I come across this story?  A relationship or family unit breaks down and people move back in with their mother or father.  That house is then overcrowded.  There are tensions, which become unbearable.  The people present as homeless, and the reason given is family breakdown.  Are they gaming the system?  They have been evicted.  They have been subject to huge rent hikes.  In fact, they tried to do the exact opposite.  They tried to avoid having anything to do with the system.  What do they get?  Do they get help?  Do they get assistance from Mr. Skehan's comments?  No.  They perceive that they are at the butt of a cruel jibe.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Skehan might say that they are not the people he is talking about.  He said today he was referring to a tiny percentage of people, and that it may be an issue.  If I walked out onto the plinth and said that I thought there may be corruption in the Cabinet, and then I qualified my comments by saying that it may be an issue or that it is a tiny percentage of Cabinet members, I know that my qualification would not be the headline in the newspapers tomorrow.  I know that because I have been around the block.  I have a little bit of experience of how sections of the media operate and the way in which comments are taken up.  Mr. Skehan is the chairperson of the Housing Agency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#P00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry is clearly not suggesting that.

I was very careful in the words I used, which was to say that if it was happening, it might be in one or two constituencies only.  I am careful with my words.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the deserving and undeserving poor, it is the opening slide in my lecture that I give people about housing.  Housing is one of the subjects I teach in DIT.  I specifically draw attention to the potential for this to be kidnapped or hijacked by people who want to use it for socially divisive means so I am well aware of the potential for hurt.  I am well aware of the potential for people to feel defamed or otherwise injured by these but I am not making this comment on the 400 or 600 people in Fingal.  I am saying this for the 85,000 people who are on our housing waiting list - the 85,000 people who, to use the words of Fr. Peter McVerry, may find themselves having a queue jumped.  I am not even going to talk about what happens when one starts the business of identity politics of saying \"you're in my group or the other\".  The whole point of drawing attention to this is because the Housing Agency's remit is all of housing - everything in housing, which is everybody who is need of social housing - and to make sure that everybody in social housing is treated fairly and given a fair opportunity.  The 100% is the concern of the agency, not the 1% causing a distortion, which are the words used, in the application of social policy.  It is the 85,000 people about which I am worried.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of defending my position, far from it because I have literally nothing to lose; I am in here to defend those 85,000 people.  I am in here to make those statements to make sure that the majority of people who are entitled to social housing and who we as a society should be proud of, are provided with it and dealt with equitably and fairly.  We are a fantastically good country.  We deal with people who are in need.  When we get out into the business of proportion and look at some states in the US where a significant proportion of the population of the entire state live in trailer homes, the 100,000 units of social accommodation we provide every year is the kind of thing we can and should be proud of.  We can always do better.  We have a waiting list of 85,000 people.  It is down from 91,000 last year to 85,000 this year so it is going in the right direction.  It will never be good enough.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#Q00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>On a point of information-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#Q00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Mr. Skehan did not interrupt the Deputy so the Deputy should let him finish his remarks and I will then let him back.

With regard to my reaction to the comment about gaming the system and the subsequent comments we heard today, from an accountability perspective, the buck stops with the Minister.  When the Minister said in the public domain that there was no evidence to suggest that, I will accept his word and leave it at that if that is okay.<\/p> <p>  With regard to homelessness being normal and the right and the expectation to investigate the situation in other countries and to compare our figures against their figures, there is nothing wrong with doing that.  There could be much to gain from doing that but I would simply ask that when the comparison is made, that this comparison is qualified with like-with-like figures because the methodology regarding how figures are compiled in some countries differs from the methodology used to compile them here.  It might suit some quarters to give the impression that it is all done in a similar way and, therefore, we can say it is normal.  That is far from being the case and I wish Mr. Skehan could acknowledge that so that is clarified as well.  <\/p> <p>  Two issues relate to a point Mr. Skehan made.  I do not think it was even in the context of that interview or articles he mentioned.  Mr. Skehan said at one stage that \"the point that starts a crisis, and the thing that makes them worse, is data being produced by people who have skin in the game.  We now have people saying we need up to 50,000 houses a year, and that's rubbish\".  That was the quote.  We now see the likes of Davy, Goodbody and the American Chamber Of Commerce Ireland putting the figure that is required to meet demand at 40,000 to 50,000.  The ESRI says 35,000 to 40,000 units are required.  The Housing Agency appears to be the only organisation that believes the demand is 20,000 to 25,000 so I ask Mr. Skehan to reiterate his confidence in that figure being the one to which we should aspire rather than 50,000.  <\/p> <p>  Can Mr. Skehan confirm that he acted in an advisory capacity to Phil Hogan while he was in opposition?  If so, does he believe the scale of that involvement with that party in some way colours his viewpoints and public statements?  I would imagine not but Mr. Skehan needs to clarify that.  In doing so, he could acknowledge that this connection is open to being drawn upon and could consequently lead to the assertion to which Deputy Barry referred.  It is understandable if that assertion is made on foot of that connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#Q01200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Could the Deputy clarify the last point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>It is the assertion about the undeserving poor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#Q01400","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Is that the Deputy's final question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#Q01500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>The Deputy has the gift of brevity.

We can all speak English and read the English newspapers at the moment.  Theresa May said two weeks ago that she was giving priority to dealing with homelessness above dealing with Brexit.  That is how big it is in Britain.  It is a huge issue all over Europe, for more or less the same suite of reasons.  We are not unique.  We should be a little bit careful about mixing the two things.

Point taken.  We do not disagree with that.  The next issue relates to data and skin in the game.  One of the most certain ways to bring about a housing crisis is to have an oversupply of unwanted dwellings.  I should not have to go into any more detail in this particular chamber as to how that has affected Ireland.  In 2008 we built 98,000 units in Ireland.  As a result of the oversupply the market for housing dried up.  People who had borrowed money to buy and build those houses lost their money to such a degree that this country experienced one of the most catastrophic falls ever experienced by a western European democracy.  The primary cause is inaccurate data that are not delivered on time.  The mechanism for bringing about the collapse of a housing market is people continuing to invest in a market long after the demand has dried up.  The agency has specifically been mandated by the Government to produce an annual housing needs assessment.  We do it every year because of the complexity of housing and those changing numbers.  Our current estimate is between 20,000 and 25,000 per annum.  Poor old Cathal Mac Coille - that is not said badly - but the Davys and those types of people and I argued long and hard about the lack of wisdom of people making excessive projections as to what the housing supply should be.  I will not name any of the people the Deputy mentioned a few minutes ago who produced projections but they are all the same people who told us we were going to have a soft landing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":509,"content":"<p>The ESRI does not have skin in the game.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#R00600","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>It certainly does.

We have 20,000 households on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  One could argue that we have a gross housing need of approximately 130,000.  The reason I say that is because all of us in here represent all of those people in our constituencies.  I am in a constituency where there are more than 4,000 households on the waiting list just for Dublin Mid-West, and perhaps 250 families in emergency accommodation.  We all want to ensure the system is fair.  It is also important to emphasise the significant majority of those people who exit emergency accommodation do not go into a council house.  In fact, if one looks at the most recent data, the majority of them go back into the private rental sector through the housing assistance payment.  I say that in case anybody listening or watching thinks that people are automatically getting access to council houses.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to stress if one looks at Focus Ireland's most recent research via the intake team, because it has the data, that the key driver of families into homelessness is a notice to quit.  The rental crisis is still driving.  Whereas the Dublin Region Homeless Executive has said that family breakdown is the largest reason, it only asked people what was the last address they had.  The Focus Ireland data goes back three addresses.  A large number of those families who are coming from family breakdown got a notice to quit.<\/p><p>However, they chose not to go down the homeless route because they understood the major difficulties that would create for them and their children.  Instead, they chose to go into family accommodation, which was unsustainable.  I make this point because it is evidence to counter the theory that there is a gaming of the system.<\/p><p> Given Mr. Skehan's strong belief that the 2016 Housing Agency report is out of date, at what point did he make a formal request to the agency to do a further study based on the anecdotal information he was receiving?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#R02600","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>As we must conclude shortly, other members who wish to ask further questions should do so now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#S00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I have a brief question.

To start at the beginning, the work of the Housing Agency with the approved housing bodies and local authorities extends across a broad spectrum.  It runs from giving them research, which we heard about, to providing practical supports.  For instance, when the housing assistance payment, HAP, was introduced, we worked closely with the local authorities, starting in Limerick city, followed by Limerick county and so forth, as we sought to find out the flaws in the system, correct these flaws and move forward.  Incidentally, the introduction of the HAP was a very good model for introducing any new process provided for in legislation.  Under this model, it is not assumed that everything will be perfect from day one.  Instead, the system is rolled out gradually and the problems with it are identified before it is extended.  This means when it hits a place the size of Dublin, many of the issues that need to be resolved have been identified, although the system will still not be perfect.  That is the type of role the Housing Agency adopted and we worked very closely with the local authorities in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of our work with the local authorities and approved housing bodies, we also work at the financing end by helping to secure financing and helping local authorities with sites they may have acquired.  We look after these sites with the local authorities and approved housing bodies.<\/p> <p>  I probably do not have to say this but much of the stuff that makes a difference in housing involves boring work in which no one is interested, for example, the regulation of approved housing bodies.  One of the major problems these bodies face in accessing international finance is being able to show they are monitored and supervised.  This involved the tedious and bureaucratic task of introducing a whole system of regulation, registration, inspection, monitoring and certification of approved housing bodies.  This task, which has been completed, is the type of work we do.  We help these bodies with direct money and advice and also provide subtle infrastructural work.  The work of the joint committee also includes ensuring that this type of slow background work is done.  The data gathering that I repeatedly refer to is part of this.<\/p> <p>  The city manager in Dublin uses a great phrase drawn from the social sciences to draw attention to this issue.  He refers to housing as \"a wicked problem\".  In this context, the word \"wicked\" does not have the same meaning as it does when used by people in Dublin.  It refers to an issue that has many intertwined parts and a change in one affect all the others.  Unfortunately for the joint committee, its remit is to deal with this incredibly complex mix of issues, all of which - data, regulation, social attitudes, social expectations and national policy - come together, and as each one changes, it has an effect on all the others.  We are trying to deal with these.<\/p> <p>  In terms of each of the systems, to return to the mortgage to rent scheme, the complexity of housing and the variety of expectations and demands are so vast that there is a major lesson to be learned.  This ties back into Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on the three major strands of housing provision, namely, direct provision, the housing assistant payment and the rental accommodation scheme, and people float in and out between these strands.  The issue is that something like this is prone to being exploited.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is absolutely right that we have to continue to look at the big picture and we must not fool ourselves or be complacent by saying, for instance, the housing list is reducing while ignoring an increase elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  The housing assistant payment and rental accommodation scheme may be in place for other reasons.  Deputies from rural areas will know that the housing assistance payment is not always for an apartment or a house in an estate.  Many houses in rural areas are paid for by housing assistance payments for reasons to do with communities and what people want or do not want to do in terms of admitting their financial status.  Such people will avail of the HAP.  This is a highly complex issue covering a very wide range of areas. <\/p> <p>  I will speed up at little as I note it is 4.30 p.m.  I do not want to get between members and the end of their day, although I can come back with more detail.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about the complexity and overlap of the three strands is absolutely correct.  To amplify the Deputy's point, the work the joint committee is doing on Focus Ireland is exactly the type of work that needs to be done.  This complexity means realising that somebody who has eventually reached the point of presentation, if I can use that word, may have had a problem in his or her family because he or she may have been moved previously to unsuitable accommodation, for example, accommodation that was not large enough.  This places stress on a family.  The question is whether this is a fair summary of what can sometimes happen and it results in people being pushed in and there is then a cascade.  We need to do that type of work.<\/p> <p>  We will agree to disagree that the reasons for homelessness in the Eastern Region Homeless Executive studies go into flux and change from time to time.  All of these data are like something one would write on water in that they change all the time.  For this reason, it is not good enough to do studies once.  The Deputy is right about the need to ask the agency to do a further study because these studies need to be done repeatedly.  We will never arrive at the point at which the data are perfect and allow us to make perfect decisions.  While Deputy &Oacute; Broin is dead right that we must be led by evidence, it is also the case that the evidence will never give us all the answers.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cowen is also dead right that international comparisons will always change and be in flux.  We can only do our best by trying to run to catch up with the data.  We will always be behind the data, however.  To go back to the international housing comparisons, people had a field day saying they were based on out-of-date information.  The information is out of date because it is based on census data which covers the period from 2011 to 2016 or whatever.  This means one will always be running to catch up with census data.  This is normal and tough and we must make brave decisions based on the best data available to us.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked whether a further study should be called for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018013100002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I asked when Mr. Skehan asked the Housing Agency to conduct a further study given his view that the 2016 study was out of date.

Members have had the opportunity to read the report and the opening statement and I do not propose to read that <i>verbatim<\/i>.  I will highlight a couple of key points.<br\/><br\/>This investigation was of the administration of the restorative justice scheme.  The comments we make are on that administration.  I want to make clear that they are not intended as a criticism of particular individuals and particularly those responsible for the day to day administration of the scheme on the front line.  That is not the purpose of the report.  We looked at three particular points.  The first was admission to the scheme and criteria for such admission.  The investigation found there was too narrow an interpretation given to the eligibility criterion, which completely ignored the practical reality of the daily life of the women who were at that time working in the laundries that were part of the scheme and living in the convents in which those laundries were located.  We are talking about women who went down the same stairs every day with women who accessed the scheme and in some instances slept in the next room to women who had access to the scheme.  They worked in the laundries that are part of the scheme.  We have been clear from the outset that we were not seeking to extend the institutions covered by the scheme but we were saying the criteria being used to determine whether the women concerned were admitted to and worked in those laundries were being interpreted too narrowly.  That is the first point.<br\/><br\/>There is a second point related to that which I will pick up.  It is to do with the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  The Department has consistently argued the Residential Institutions Redress Board provided access to redress for some of the women we are talking about.<\/p><p>I wish to make several points about that.  The first point is that it is possible to distinguish between the wrongs that were intended to be covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board and those covered by this scheme.  They were not intended to provide redress for the same things.  The judge considering the issue in the High Court said that though it might be difficult to distinguish, it was still possible to do so.<\/p><p> A second point is important.  That scheme is closed and some of these women had no access to it.  The fact is that to avoid some people supposedly being compensated twice for the same wrong, some people are being denied any compensation.  That cannot be right.<\/p><p> I am keen to raise some issues around how the length of time women spent in the laundries was calculated.  We believe that too much reliance was placed on the records of the convents.  There was insufficient interrogation of all the available evidence, for example, social security records, which would have enabled a different conclusion to be reached.  The Department has accepted that recommendation and is working on it.<\/p><p> The third issue we examined was capacity.  Some women are entitled to access the scheme and there is no dispute about their entitlement but they do not have the capacity to enter into the necessary agreements that form part of the process of giving redress.  As a consequence, some of these women have not received redress.  Committee members will have seen that the number of women in that circumstance has reduced over time.  Regrettably, part of that reduction is because women have died before gaining access to the scheme.  We highlighted this but no work had been done prior to beginning our investigation.  We have now recommended, reluctantly, that the best way to address this is to ensure those women are made wards of court.  It is not ideal &ndash; we are the first to accept that &ndash; but we can see no other way of ensuring that these women receive access to redress.  For that to happen there needs to be a proactive programme from the Department.  It is not sufficient to make telephone calls to the Office of Wards of Court.  There needs to be active engagement with the women's carers.  Where they are not in a position to move forward supports need to be put in place to ensure the ward of court process can be activated.<\/p><p> When it comes down to it, I am before the committee today in unusual circumstances.  I have been an ombudsman for ten years, four of which I have spent in Ireland and six years elsewhere previously.  During that time I have never reached the point where a Department has, prior to the publication of a report, absolutely and categorically refused to engage with the process around accepting and implementing the recommendations.  I am very disappointed by that.<\/p><p> Since the report was issued, the Minister has essentially agreed to the implementation of three of the recommendations in the D&aacute;il.  However, as I have said, in respect of the wards of court process we believe implementation is still not proceeding vigorously enough.  Nonetheless, I am pleased that the length of stay and all evidence will now be considered.  Moreover, I am pleased that Government as a whole will consider a process for designing future redress schemes to avoid the problems we encountered when we looked at the administration of this scheme.  The fact remains that, as of my appearance before the committee today, the Government has still not formally agreed to implement this recommendation.<\/p><p> I wish to make two points in that regard.  First, we have been told that &euro;25.7 million has been spent - the Minister said that.  I believe the figure has now risen to &euro;27 million.  The upper estimate for the scheme at the point it was developed was &euro;54 million.  The nature of the wrong done to these women needs to be addressed regardless of the cost.  Even at that, the issue arises.<\/p><p> My second point relates to the prohibition on dual funding inserted in the scheme.  It was not inserted to the scheme that went before Government.  It was put in as an administrative footnote.  We believe that the scheme should not have had this prohibition as the two redress arrangements were for different wrongs.  We now want to see those women receive the compensation belatedly that they should have received.<\/p><p> Women continue to contact the staff in my office.  I will summarise the point they make to us.  They say that they worked in those laundries, they washed the soiled sheets of the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison and the women who worked alongside them have received redress.  They ask why they have been excluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018013100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Tyndall.

What does Mr. Tyndall say to the suggestion that it may be appropriate to exclude persons who had already been compensated under the Residential Institutions Redress Board and then permit anyone who was in a neighbouring institution to apply?

One of them is that the Residential Institutions Redress Board, RIRB, scheme was not designed to compensate people for forced labour, and that is what we are talking about in the Magdalen laundries.  Even if people had access to the scheme, they would not be getting redress in respect of that aspect.  The second point I would make is that there are women who did not, in any event, receive redress under that scheme and who now have no prospect of receiving redress under it, and they will be permanently excluded from redress for a wrong that everyone accepts they should never have suffered.  We are talking particularly about young women who were detained for whatever reason.  Most of those young women today would be taken into care.  Instead, they were forced to work alongside older women in these laundries, and we need to compensate them for that.  I have a personal view, which is that it would be better to run the risk of double compensation than to see people excluded from access to redress that they should receive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018013100002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Tyndall satisfied that enough efforts have been made by the Department to ensure that women who worked within the laundries are aware of the scheme and have applied for the scheme or is there anything else he believes the Department could do to apprise women of their entitlements under this scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018013100002#H00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The Department did set out to publicise the scheme but the reality is that many of the highly effective non-governmental organisations, NGOs, voluntary organisations and others who have worked with the women have been more effective in getting the message across to people who were affected.

It is fair to say we are in an unprecedented situation.  To be honest, his report was scathing.  It revealed a deeply flawed administrative process which resulted in women being wrongfully denied an entitlement they had and it is clear that has deeply affected Mr. Tyndall.  I thank him for his compassion in that regard but how did we get here and what is being done to address it now?  It struck me that Mr. Tyndall stated in the report that this scheme was supposed to be brought in to deal with the hurt and pain caused and it has led to more hurt and more pain.  Basically, people were told they are liars when they outlined their experiences, and their testimony was held up against what was not even evidence by the religious institutions but the word of the religious institutions that a particular woman was not in the laundry for the time.  In his report, Mr. Tyndall stated that that was not even questioned.  The Department did not even ask for evidence to support what the congregations were saying and then dismissed the testimony of the women and disempowered them in the process.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall's report is powerful.  I have never seen the like of it, and I thank him for that, but we need to address how we got here and if the issue will be addressed.  We will make points to the Department, but in its response initially, the former Secretary General said that Mr. Tyndall had a fundamental misunderstanding of the scheme and that if more staff had been interviewed about the administration of the scheme, he might have understood it better.  If more interviews had been held with the staff, would that have made a difference to Mr. Tyndall?  Subsequent to his report, I tabled some questions and the Minister has assured us that the scheme was administered with compassion, dedication and so on.  Is there anything Mr. Tyndall can add to that because we want to put questions to the Department?  In his report Mr. Tyndall said the Department was consulted extensively so there is a discrepancy between what is being said and in terms of where we are at now.  Mr. Tyndall might deal with that issue first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018013100002#H00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":581,"content":"<p>We had good access to records and to the people administering the scheme.

Before addressing the recommendations of the report of the Ombudsman, I want to give some background.  I will start with the residential institutions redress scheme run by the Department of Education and Skills as that has a bearing on the main issue raised by the Ombudsman.  Following on from a State apology made in May 1999 for child abuse in various institutions, a statutory redress scheme was established pursuant to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  A board was established to make awards to people who suffered abuse as children in any of the institutions scheduled to that Act.  My understanding is there is no specific definition of \"abuse\" and that that was left to the redress board to decide.  There was an acceptance by the State that it was legally as well as morally responsible for these wrongs, and the 2002 Act allowed a person to pursue a claim either through the courts or through the board.  The cost of payments under this scheme alone was in the region of &euro;1.25 billion.  This does not include legal or administrative costs.  As well as the redress board, a statutory commission was established to inquire into the historical abuse of children in certain institutions.<\/p><p>The commission published its report in 2009 and concluded that physical and sexual abuse was widespread in many of the institutions.  Industrial schools were particularly prominent in the report.  The Ryan commission report was the first comprehensive and authoritative account of the abuses suffered by children in these institutions.  In the same year, the Department was approached by and met two groups, Justice for Magdalenes and Magdalene Survivors Together.  Our understanding was that they wanted the State to acknowledge responsibility for abuses in Magdalen institutions, issue an apology and provide a redress scheme similar to that provided for residents of industrial schools under the 2002 Act.  It was clear that they regarded Magdalen institutions as separate institutions from industrial schools.<br\/><br\/>In June 2011, Dr. Martin McAleese was asked to look at State involvement with the Magdalen institutions, in respect of which he was supported by an interdepartmental committee.  His report, comprising over 1,000 pages, was published in February 2013 and it is a comprehensive account of the ten Magdalen institutions that operated within the State for a period of 70 years.  Following on from this report, the Taoiseach apologised unreservedly to the women who had been admitted to Magdalen institutions.  In his apology, the Taoiseach referred in detail to the findings of the McAleese report he and announced that a High Court judge, Mr. Justice John Quirke, had been asked to devise a scheme to address the needs of the Magdalen women.  Mr. Justice Quirke produced his report in May 2013, which was published by Government in June 2013.  While all his recommendations were accepted in principle by the Government there were administrative issues to be teased out and an interdepartmental committee was tasked with examining how they could be best implemented.  On the basis of that committee&rsquo;s report, the <i>ex gratia <\/i>scheme was finalised and adopted by Government on 5 November 2013.  The scheme applied to 12 named institutions, ten of which were Magdalen institutions.  These institutions were perceived by the religious as places of refuge or asylum for women.  A proportion of the funding for their operation came from commercial laundries on site and the institutions became known to the public as Magdalen laundries.  However, the laundries were not intrinsic to the institutions.  Some had farms and in others the women engaged in lace work which was sold.  The other two named institutions, Stanhope Street, Dublin and Summerhill, Wexford were not Magdalen institutions.  Our understanding is that they were live-in training centres where young girls who had finished primary school were taught skills that would make them more employable in domestic service, hotels, etc.<br\/><br\/>I would like to make three points about the administration of the scheme.  First, we were very conscious of the advanced age of many of the women concerned and, therefore, the Department went to great lengths to make as many payments as possible as quickly as possible.  Even though the scheme was not finalised until November 2013 arrangements were put in place to start processing applications in June 2013.  As a result, just three months after finalisation of the scheme, namely, February 2014, almost 200 applicants had received their lump sum payments and a further 120 had received a formal offer.  As such, almost 40% of total applications had been processed in that period.  Second, this was not just a Department of Justice and Equality scheme.  A unit of that Department assessed applications and paid the initial lump sums but ongoing payments are made through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and health benefits are dealt with by the Health Service Executive.  For many of the women concerned the pension payments are more valuable than the lump sum payments.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of those agencies for all the work they have done in facilitating this scheme.  Third, the Department was represented at meetings in April 2010 between former residents of institutions - industrial schools, in particular - and the Taoiseach.  What was particularly striking and sad was the anger expressed by those residents towards those who were tasked with assisting them in obtaining redress under the 2002 redress Act.  A lot of dissatisfaction was aired at that meeting.  Influenced by this, we advised Mr. Justice Quirke that the scheme should operate with the least amount of work and stress imposed on applicants.  Once an application is received, the staff of the unit within the Department take on the responsibility of carrying out all the research necessary to verify that the applicant had been in one of the 12 institutions and the timeframe in that regard.  This is all that is required for a provisional offer to be made to an applicant as the scheme is based only on verified length of stay in a relevant institution.<i><\/i>As a result of the active and sensitive approach by the staff of the unit, a good rapport has generally been established with applicants and the feedback has been very positive.  As an example, I would like to read an extract from the latest expression of appreciation received from the daughter of an applicant, which is addressed to the Minister and dated 3 September 2017.<\/p><blockquote>I feel X (a Justice staff member) went above and beyond, she was so nice and always said if my mam had any questions or was unsure of anything just to pick up the phone, and my mam been 87 can sometimes be nervous of new people but with X this wasn't the case. So I would just like to let you know how professional she is at her job and how kind she has been and it didn't go unnoticed.<\/blockquote><p>This is typical of the response of most applicants.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of the current state of play under the scheme, 830 applications have been received, approximately 200 of them from abroad, one has been withdrawn and one is still being processed.  Decisions have been made in the case of the remaining 828 cases, 686 applicants have been paid a total of &euro;25.7 million in lump sum payments and a further &euro;258,000 in legal costs has been paid out.  This does not include the ongoing costs of pension payments or medical card provision, which amounts to several million euro per year.  Offers have been made but not yet paid in the case of a further 36 cases, including 17 cases where there is an issue of capacity.  Some 106 applications have been refused as not having been admitted to and worked in one of the 12 institutions.<br\/><br\/>I will now comment on the recommendations made by the Ombudsman, the first of which relates to eligibility for admission to the scheme.  The Ombudsman has taken the view that the Department of Justice and Equality has the authority to make payments under the scheme to persons who were in another institution on the same campus as one of the 12 named institutions.  When this was first raised with us in the context of one institution, An Grian&aacute;n, our response was that we would be as flexible as possible in applying the scheme but where a person had been admitted to an institution that was regarded in law as a separate institution and was covered by the residential institutions redress scheme we did not have the discretion or authority to include them in the Magdalen scheme.  We said that we would have to go back to Government to get a decision on such a matter.  The Ombudsman did not agree with that view and it was this issue that led to his investigation.  His recommendation now is that the scheme applies to all other institutions on the same campus.  In most cases, these would be industrial schools but they would include other types of institutions, such as orphanages, primary schools and so on as well.<br\/><br\/>My apologies in advance to the committee but my explanation as to why the Department does not have the authority to extend the scheme in the way suggested by the Ombudsman has to be legalistic and it does not relate to the merits or otherwise of extending the scheme, which is a policy matter for Government.  As civil servants, we are required to account to the Comptroller and Auditor General for every payment made and, if necessary, to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have to be able to show the legal basis or other authority for payments made from public funds.  The Magdalen scheme is an <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme with no statutory base as approved by Government in 2013.  It does not fall within the normal remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, which is significant in terms of our ability to pay.  The sole authority for payments under the scheme therefore is the Government decision on the matter.  The Department takes the view that the relevant Government decisions do not grant authority to make payments under the scheme to a person admitted to a legally separate institution even if it was on the same campus as one of the 12 named institutions.  The reasons for the Department taking this view are as follows.  The Government, when approving the scheme, accepted the September 2013 report of the interdepartmental group on implementation of the Quirke report, which specifically addressed the question of other institutions on the same campus and stated that it was proposed to exclude institutions such as industrial schools and primary schools to avoid double payments and this was accepted by the Government.<\/p><p>The initial assessments of numbers and costs of the scheme were calculated only on the basis of those in Magdalen institutions.  At no stage did the Government, any Government Minister or any official express a view to us that a person admitted to an institution other than the 12 listed would receive payments under the Magdalen scheme.  The scheme approved by Government is not focused on laundry work.  Women admitted to Magdalen institutions who never worked in the laundry are covered by the scheme.  The scheme was a response to the McAleese report which gives a vivid impression of those who lived in these institutions.  It refers to how most found themselves quite alone in what was, by today's standards, a harsh and physically demanding environment.  Some were poor and homeless, some were placed by their own families, some were young women over 16 who had been orphaned, some did not know why they were there and some did not know when they would get out and see their families again.  The High Court, in a judgment delivered on this issue on 1 June 2017, stated, \"It is not appropriate that any applicant under the ex gratia scheme should receive compensation, however described from the Redress Board Scheme and the ex gratia scheme covering the same wrong.\"  The Department of Justice and Equality cannot unilaterally extend a scheme that has financial implications for other Departments.<\/p><p> I mentioned the question of double payments.  There was one exception which proves the rule.  The Department of Education and Skills, in the interdepartmental committee, drew our attention to the fact that a limited cohort of women were admitted to Magdalen institutions having been transferred from industrial schools.  These were already entitled to payments under the residential institution redress scheme for the period up to the age of 18.  That covered the period in the industrial school as well as the period in the Magdalen scheme.  A concern was raised that this limited cohort could receive a double payment for the same period for the same institution.  It was this limited exception that was considered by Mr. Justice Quirke and his decision was that the scheme should not seek to investigate or consider this matter further.<\/p><p> It is this first recommendation of the Ombudsman that causes us difficulty.  It has administrative, financial and resource implications for ourselves and, more importantly, for other Departments.  At a minimum, it would at least double the number of institutions in the scheme.  We have started a process to estimate the additional numbers that would be involved.  As part of that process, we are consulting other Departments which have an interest in the running of the scheme.<\/p><p> Moving to the second recommendation, for the reasons explained earlier, our application process was designed to make payments as quickly as possible and with the minimum stress for the applicant.  To do this, we started the process before the scheme was finalised.  We deliberately processed the most straightforward applications first.  We looked for written records to support an application.  Where written records confirmed an applicant's entitlement and the applicant agreed, we made an offer almost immediately.  Where the records held by the religious bodies were not complete or were challenged by the applicant, all other sources were checked, including social insurance, school records, electoral registers etc.  At all stages, there was much informal contact with applicants.  Indeed, some of the women used to ring up regularly for a chat.<\/p><p> A formal interview was only required where there were no written records available to support an application.  These were processed later since they were the most complicated applications, with interviews starting in October 2014, by when we had built up a level of expertise that allowed a fair and decisive interview.  Only 73 cases required a formal interview and, of those, 69 were successful in their application, largely on the basis of their testimony and in the absence of supporting documentation.  This point is noteworthy in illustrating that we sought to assist rather than obstruct women in getting their entitlements.  Women regarded this formal interview as quite a harrowing experience.  They had to be reassured.  They were always allowed to bring a companion but they did not like the interview process.<\/p><p> The Ombudsman is correct that the approach of starting to process applications before the full details had been finalised by the Government has disadvantages.  We believe these were outweighed by the advantages.  The alternative, if we followed the system the Ombudsman advised, would have been to slow down the process of payments by six to 12 months.  Although we started accepting applications before the scheme was finalised, the full terms of the scheme were only made available to an applicant when a formal offer was made.  If a person was refused, an explanation of why a person was refused was given.  I accept the Ombudsman's view that it was remiss of us not to have given all applicants, including those who were refused, the full terms of the scheme at the earliest possible stage.  I would also point out that when an applicant was refused, the applicant was advised that it could be referred to the Ombudsman's office.  As recommended by the Ombudsman, we are happy to review all those cases where there was a dispute over the length of stay using all available sources of evidence.  To ensure that such reviews are seen to be objective and independent, we intend to set up a panel of people from outside to carry out these reviews.<\/p><p> I will address the matter of capacity.  The Ombudsman, in his report, explains the background to the capacity issue and why it was not considered possible to use the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke.  Following discussions with our colleagues in the Department of Health, we thought that the second best option would be to include a provision in an Act specific to the Magdalen scheme and we had a Bill ready shortly afterwards which became the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015.  However, by the time that Bill was ready for publication, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was at an advanced stage and was enacted the same year.  It is clear that the decision support service to be established under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 would be the most effective option in these cases.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the decision support service within the Mental Health Commission, a body under the Department of Health, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  A high-level steering group is overseeing the establishment of the decision support service.  A director of the service was appointed in October 2017 and &euro;3 million has been provided in the 2018 Estimates for the Department of Justice and Equality for the service's establishment.<\/p><p> Pending the establishment of the decision support service, officials have been encouraging the use of other options to allow payments to be made, and we continue to examine what other options may be available.  There are currently 17 such cases and three are in the process of making applications to be wards of court.  We are in touch with the Courts Service about facilitating such applications.  However, being made a ward of court may be viewed as inappropriate in cases and it cannot be regarded as the automatic solution.  While the Department regrets the delay in paying these women, it is also conscious that it has a duty of care to protect such vulnerable women from potential financial exploitation.  The wards of court system is regarded as being incompatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Unfortunately, it is a very black-and-white situation.  It is appropriate for a person who has absolutely no capacity but a person who has some capacity but not complete capacity loses all decision-making powers if he or she is made a ward of court.<\/p><p> The Ombudsman has made the point that the last recommendation in the report is addressed not only to the Department of Justice and Equality, and we have written to the relevant Departments to draw their attention to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018013100002#L01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jimmy Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Martin for coming in and for his presentation.

A steering group was set up in early 2016 to oversee that process, and its work is ongoing.  The process of recruiting the director is prescribed in the Act.  It has to be done by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  That person was to be appointed by the Mental Health Commission.  That process has concluded and the director took up the position at the beginning of October of 2017.  She is now in place and is working very actively towards ensuring that everything is in place for the Act to be commenced.  There is a tendering process ongoing at the moment for business process analyst and project management expertise so that we can scope out an implementation plan.  There are various components that have to be in place and regulations that have to be made, some by the Minister for Justice and Equality, some by the Minister for Health and some by the director.

The whole presentation is clouded in a defence of what has happened rather than a genuine embracing of comments made to improve the lot of people for whom we set up a scheme because the State wronged them.  That was the starting point.  At the heart of this, there are women whom the State wronged and we are trying to establish a scheme that is best to deal with them.  That was not the starting point.

At that stage we had said to the Ombudsman that it would be a matter for Government.  We had no objections to raising it with the Government at that stage but he disagreed.  He said it was not a question for Government, that it was a question for the civil servants operating the scheme.  We considered at that stage going to Government about An Grian&aacute;n, but the concern was that we were not sure how extensive his final recommendation would be.  We knew he was looking at industrial schools and we did not know the scope of his final recommendation.  In that context, we said we would wait to see what his final recommendation would be, so he would clarify exactly what the scope was.  We did not go to Government at that stage.  When his publication was finally reached, we clarified the full scope of that.  We sent an information note to the Government but, under Government procedures, we have to work out the implications of implementing that recommendation, and that is what we are doing now.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Daly's question regarding the 69 of the 73 people interviewed who got redress, it is not a black and white situation.  In some cases we gave more than was sought because when we would have checked the records, we would have found that the period involved was higher than the people recollected.  People knew they had been in an institution but they were not very clear about the exact period of time.  Regarding the 69 women of the 73 interviewed who got the award, in those cases there was absolutely no written record of any sort beginning, middle or end and, in most cases, the women did not know the exact period.

That was a rough estimate, so it depended on the number of applicants but there was no decision other than that.<\/p> <p>  On top of that it was reckoned that it would cost an extra &euro;1.7 million in weekly payments, because if one gets more than &euro;100,000, part of that is paid in weekly payments and then there is the medical card element.  The Department of Health reckoned it would cost perhaps &euro;3 million a year.  The sum of &euro;1.7 million per annum also includes Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection moneys that are paid out.  There is an ongoing cost.  There was never a definite cost.

There is no set figure.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality does not have any financial interest in restricting the scheme.

I can make a copy of the letter available to the committee, if that is helpful.  In that letter we set out our view that there was a <i>prima facie<\/i>case that there had been maladministration in the way the criteria were interpreted, and we understood that the Department took a different view.  We said, in that letter, that should the Department feel that the appropriate way forward was to go to Government to seek revisions to the scheme, whereas we did not believe those to be necessary, we would support them in going forward.  The Department, as the committee will understand, did not respond positively to that suggestion and that is why the investigation commenced.  That gives some context to some of the areas that members sought to elucidate.<br\/><br\/>The memorandum to Government, which we have seen, did not specifically include people who were beneficiaries of the residential institutions redress scheme.  The scheme was specifically intended to address injury caused by abuse in one of the listed institutions.  It was not intended to redress being resident in an institution and working in a Magdalen laundry.  Our contention remains that it was entirely possible to interpret the scheme.  The committee will have seen from the report that an administrative note was added to exclude people who had access to the residential institutions redress scheme.  That was not part of the memorandum to Government.  <br\/><br\/>The Department properly says that it does not have access to information, officially, as to which women benefitted from the scheme but I must tell the committee that the application form for the scheme asks women if they have benefitted from same.  While it does not have access to the records of the scheme, it has asked the women.  Whereas nothing that was said to the committee is incorrect, it is not the whole picture.  <br\/><br\/>We have heard An Grian&aacute;n mentioned.  An Grian&aacute;n was not a separate building until 1990.  It was separated from the rest of the institution by a stud partition.  Essentially, people were in the same building, worked in the same laundry, ate the same foods and saw the same nuns.  We simply do not accept that this was a distinct institution.  Parts of it may have had a different name but in any other ordinary human understanding of what was happening this was the same place.  There is no dispute that these women worked in the laundries that are covered by the scheme.  I have to keep coming back to that point.  This is not disputed at any stage.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, I want to come to the issue of Ri Villa.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018013100002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Tyndall"},{"type":"speech","time":1517389200,"counter":845,"content":"<p>On Sean McDermott Street in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018013100002#V00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517389200,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Yes.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Denis Leamy, chief executive officer, and Mr. Gerry Murphy, deputy chief executive officer.<\/p> <p>  This is a new committee.  We had our first meeting on 29 November 2017.  Rural development support is the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the committee is interested in several elements of the policy.  The EU plans to spend almost &euro;100 billion on rural development policy in the period 2014 to 2020 through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  In Ireland, we plan to spend &euro;4 billion of public money on our rural development programme, RDP, during this period.  The committee met members of the EU Court of Auditors recently and examined their special report: Rural Development Programming: less complexity and more focus on results needed.  I welcome its recommendations and conclusions to reduce complexity and the focus on performance and results.  However, the future is unknowable and unforeseen shocks to the system can undo the best laid plans.  We need only mention Brexit or recent threats to international trade and the effects of climate change.<\/p> <p>  The committee has an oversight role in respect of the Department of Rural and Community Development and the following bodies come under its remit: Pobal, Western Development Commission, Irish Water Safety, and the Charities Regulator.  Pobal is the first body to appear before the committee.  The organisation disbursed &euro;615 million directly to beneficiaries in 2017, up from &euro;257 million in 2011.  Given Pobal's importance, the committee is interested in hearing about its past performance, current issues and future strategies.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am joined by my colleague, Jerry Murphy, who is deputy CEO.<\/p> <p>  Pobal, formerly known as Area Development Management, was established in 1992 by the Irish Government with the European Commission to manage an EU grant for local development.  We work to support communities and local agencies towards achieving social inclusion and development.  Our activities and priorities are shaped by the context and policies laid out in several reports, including the programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work, the Action Plan for Rural Development, the framework policy for local and community development in Ireland, Putting People First, and EU 2020.  We are in the process of developing a new strategic plan for 2018 to 2021 which will form the basis of how Pobal responds to the needs of communities and our funders over the next three years.  We will ensure that our new strategy takes account of the principles contained within the national planning framework when it is finalised later this quarter.<\/p> <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s work supports the delivery of valuable services to marginalised communities in Ireland.  Some of the groups supported by Government through Pobal include the long-term unemployed, young people, farmers, fishermen, families, Travellers, older people and ex-prisoners.  We have formed alliances nationally and internationally to advance our service delivery model, including close working relationships with the OECD and ESRI.  Our day-to-day work involves assisting on programme design, assessing grant applications, proposals and plans, managing contracts, distributing funding, monitoring progress, and auditing beneficiaries.  We provide good practice case studies, evaluations, and demographic information that support Departments in making policy decisions.  We make tools such as Pobal Maps and the Pobal HP deprivation index freely available to allow policymakers and communities respond to needs identified by these sets of tools.<\/p> <p>  Through our work, Pobal supports collaborative approaches to planning and decision-making.  We work to promote good relationships between the community sector, State agencies and other stakeholders.  In keeping with our goal to operate a balanced regional approach to service delivery, we operate from office bases in Dublin, Monaghan, Sligo, Clifden, Letterkenny, Galway city, Limerick and Kilkenny.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is our lead Department and I will later discuss some of the governance and regulatory mechanisms under which we operate.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, Pobal managed 23 programmes, primarily for four Departments.  The full list of programmes is detailed in the supporting information provided to the committee.  In managing these programmes, Pobal distributed almost &euro;615 million to beneficiaries.  We had contracts with almost 5,000 groups throughout the country, channelled funding to 4,360 child care providers which support 162,848 children, and supported 24,780 people in employment and enterprise programmes in 2016, with an additional 7,960 supported into employment or self-employment through the social inclusion community activation programme, SICAP.  This activity was achieved with an average of 356 staff, 45% of whom are based outside of Dublin.<\/p> <p>  Our total administration spend for 2017 was &euro;26.4 million, or 4.1% of programme costs.  This is down from 5.68% in 2008, 4.60% in 2015 and 4.44 % in 2016.  Pobal&rsquo;s work has grown significantly in recent years, with the amount of funds disbursed rising from &euro;257 million in 2011 to the current level of &euro;615 million in 2017.  Significant amounts of that growth have taken place within the early years sector, as support to parents and child care providers has grown.<\/p> <p>  In preparing for today, we decided to focus in detail on those programmes which we administer on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Members should have a separate briefing paper detailing these programmes.  If members of the committee have any questions on other programmes, I and my team would be happy to furnish them with the details at a later stage. <\/p> <p>  Over the course of our 25 years, Pobal has evolved in response to Government priorities.  We are dedicated to supporting communities and civic society in responding to local needs.  Our board and staff are committed to supporting Government in its work to make Ireland a fairer place to live for all of our communities.  We are also aware of the need to ensure that our procedures are fair, not overly burdensome and are appropriate to the size of the funds being allocated.  This is not easy in a world where there is a need and expectation for increased governance, oversight and financial prudence.<\/p> <p>  It is company policy to identify the minimum data requirements needed for the effective administration of a given scheme.  However, issues such as European level data requirements must be factored into this design process.  Key achievements over the past 12 months have included reducing by more than one third the non-financial annual reporting requirements under the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, significantly reducing the minimum participant information required under the new SICAP programme for 2018 to 2022  as of 1 January 2018, and reducing some of the contractual obligations on seniors alert scheme community groups.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that there is significantly more work to do on this area and it will be an important element of our new strategic plan.  We are increasingly using online platforms as a measure for reducing red tape while at the same time ensuring sufficient checks, balances and audit trails are in place to protect taxpayers' money.  The seniors alert scheme is a good example of a technical solution that was delivered by Pobal and the Department to reduce administration and delays in getting personal monitored alarms fitted in vulnerable older people&rsquo;s homes.  We can turn requests for personal monitored alarms around within a 24-hour period, or shorter in the case of emergencies.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, Pobal has established a formal feedback and engagement process, which ensures that the voice of beneficiary organisations are factored into operational decision-making.  As part of this project, an independent organisation was recently commissioned to undertake a series of workshops to identify areas for improvement in Pobal&rsquo;s administration of grants on behalf of Government.  This report, currently in draft stage, has highlighted a number of successes as well as areas for development and improvement.  The report finds that among beneficiaries in the social inclusion sector, 85% believed that Pobal provides clear guidance and information on the application process, 76% reported that Pobal provides good customer service, and 78% reported that training events are useful and helpful.  The issue of the level of information required by Pobal was identified as an area for possible improvement and, as I have mentioned, a number of steps have been and continue to be implemented to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiary organisations.<\/p> <p>  A commitment to social inclusion is at the heart of Pobal.  While there have been improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic landscape, there are still a number of key issues requiring attention, funding and collaborative solutions.  A few key findings from our 2016 deprivation index are that affluence is highest in the urban peripheries and gradually declines as one moves towards rural locations.  Dublin has fared the best over the past ten years, being less impacted by the effects of the recession, as well as disproportionately benefiting from the recent years of recovery.  Small towns of 1,000 of 5,000 people have been the worst affected over the past ten years, having been disproportionately hit by the recession and benefiting less from the recovery than the most urban and the most rural areas.  We would also attest to the need for further targeted initiatives and responses for those on the margins of our society.<\/p> <p>  Pobal operates on the basis of a framework agreement with the Department of Rural and Community Development and programme-specific service level agreements with individual Departments.<\/p><p>Each year a programme of work is agreed with each Department for any work Pobal is requested to undertake.<\/p><p> Key features of Pobal's governance structures include that members of the board work on a voluntary basis and are appointed at the discretion of the Government.  The State board appointment process is utilised by the Department of Rural and Community Development for the initial selection of interested and suitable parties to be appointed to the board.  The term of office of our current chairperson, Mr. Seamus Boland, is due to conclude in 2018 and I expect a new chair-designate will be before the joint committee later this year.<\/p><p> Pobal is responsible for adhering to all relevant legislative provisions, Department circulars, guidelines and public financial procedures issued by the Government.  We are subject to the 2016 code of governance for non-commercial State bodies and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General annually.  Pobal is registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority and is fully compliant with all its obligations in that regard.  Pobal reports to Departments through regular governance meetings, and delivery of programme reports and data and is subject to regular audits by Departments.<\/p><p> Over time, Pobal has adapted its skill sets and competencies to respond to the changes and challenges in the socio-economic landscape.  We are in the process of developing a new strategic plan, while also undertaking a leadership review of the organisation.  It is hoped both processes will ensure the organisation is lean, fit for purpose and responsive to the future needs of communities and government.<\/p><p> It goes without saying that the unsung heroes of the work in which we are involved are the boards, committees and volunteers that work to make their communities better places to live.  A great strength of community development is that it emerges from communities.  The State relies heavily on community groups to deliver services.  Pobal, with 25 years of experience, supports the continued sustainability of these services in towns and villages throughout Ireland.  As the chief executive officer of the organisation, I am confident in the work Pobal delivers daily.  As the company continues to grow and adapt to the requirements of Government, we have the expertise and people needed to support communities in future.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to appear before the joint committee.  Mr. Murphy and I will be please to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Leamy and Mr. Murphy.  Having been involved in many boards and committees on a voluntary basis, I would have liked an opportunity to review the 23 programmes being rolled out by Pobal because I would be able to connect to many of them.<\/p><p>Some years ago, a new social inclusion programme was introduced which focused initially on farmers and fishermen.  It subsequently changed, however, and in west Cork it became more focused on Roma and other sections of society that have nothing to do with my area.  This was a serious blow because farmers and fishermen, especially those on low incomes, lost a great advisory service provided under the programme.  While I do not know what form the new social inclusion programme will take and I do not seek to discredit anyone, there are no Roma in Goleen, Bandon or anywhere else in west Cork.  I do not know why discussions on the ground did not filter back to the needs of the constituency I represent and, I presume, many more constituencies.  I ask the witnesses to clarify that matter.<\/p><p>Pobal probably has some connections with the Leader programme, which is basically no longer available.  With only two years left of the current programme, there has been little or no delivery to the community and voluntary sector.  This is alarming to say the least and it will be a scramble to the line to have the available moneys disbursed to community and voluntary groups.  These organisations, all of which are voluntary, receive a small amount of funding and deliver a large number of services.  The people involved do not receive any payment for the many hours of work they do.  They have been telephoning politicians trying to secure Leader funding as this used to be available to them.  The number of hoops they must now jump through means many of them have decided to forget it.<\/p><p>The West Cork Development Partnership, an excellent group that previously delivered the Leader programme, was wiped off the face of the earth for no reason.  We no longer have a programme in the area and I understand it is now delivered through the Aran Islands.  This is mind-boggling and questions need to be answered because it will probably lead to an inquiry in a few years.  While that issue may not have anything to do with the witnesses, there is no harm in letting them know how people on the ground feel.<\/p><p>Pobal delivers the community services programme.  I am often asked the same question about the schemes operated under this programme, some of which were allowed to appoint managers.  If a manager retires, can he or she seek redundancy from the community group in question?  This is a serious concern for the community and voluntary sector because many of these groups are being asked this question by managers contemplating retirement.  The programme has been in place for many years.  Who would fund redundancy payments?  Voluntary organisations are extremely worried that they may be expected to do so.<\/p><p>Payment for bank holidays and so forth is also a grey area.  Many issues arise regarding section 39 funding, which I accept is not the business of Pobal.  However, the bottom line with the community service programme is that Pobal provides funding to the voluntary organisations which must then administer the funding.  This is a significant burden and things fall between the cracks.  Some of the organisations are concerned that workers may be entitled to payment for bank holidays on which they do not work.  They fear they may end up in serious trouble.  In one case, a group was fined &euro;4,000 by Pobal, which was a scandalous decision.  The group in question bought a work unit which community service programme workers could work in.  However, it was later told it should have rented the unit and Pobal would have paid the rent.  The organisation did the honest thing by buying the work unit from its funding and applying a small charge on Pobal, which refused to pay it and asked for the money to be returned.  This is brutal for a voluntary organisation.<\/p><p>We need to consider what is happening on the ground.  When people see attractive programmes advertised, they may decide to bring them into their community on a voluntary basis.  They are then subjected to audits.  I was the chairman of one group where the treasurer nearly suffered a breakdown as a result of an audit that was carried out.  The auditor was ruthless.  I did not give a damn because the bottom line was that we were all volunteers.  I was not a politician at the time.  I told the auditor to stop being ruthless as we were all human beings and asked if there was an issue.  He replied that there were no issues and everything was fine.  It was as if he had to justify his day's work in west Cork or wherever else he visited.  This is not good enough.  When a group makes a human error, the auditor should sit down with the individuals involved and rectify the problems rather than fining the group because that could put it out of business.  The treasurers and other volunteers doing great work in their communities may decide they can no longer cope and will not want to be involved in what appears to be professional work that is way over their heads.<\/p><p>I am not arguing that Pobal's work is all bad but I need to have these issues clarified.  Where is the delivery in respect of farmers and fishermen?  Is Pobal involved in delivering the rural social scheme?  This fabulous scheme for low-income farmers and fishermen has become less attractive because payments have changed, which is a significant worry.  We fought bravely and successfully when negotiating the programme for Government to have the numbers on the scheme increased.  I notice, however, that the increase <i>per capita<\/i>in west Cork was among the lowest in the country, despite the area having large numbers of inshore fishermen and low-income farmers, primarily suckler farmers.<\/p><p>I would appreciate it if they might be able to answer some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#C00200","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins.

I will respond to some of the issues and I might call on my colleague to respond to some of the others because he is more familiar with some of the questions the Deputy raised.<\/p> <p>  I will respond on the community services programme first because the Deputy raised a number of issues in terms of the audits and the burden that is placed on voluntary committees involved in that.  On the context, there are more than 350 community service projects nationwide and the Department requires us to audit at least 5% of them on an annual basis.  A set of rules has been set up for the community services programme by the Department against which we have to audit.  Some issues that come across to the groups - I fully understand that from a local perspective, one would wonder why Pobal or the State is chasing an item of expenditure - are against the rules under which the programme was set up.  They are against the rules to which the group signed up.  We have raised this with the Department and have been working through it to try to change some of the rules to get rid of some of these anomalies over time.  I also am aware that the Minister, Deputy Ring, is planning to review the programme towards the end of the year, which might allow for some of these pieces to be looked at.  In terms of our role, our auditors go out to audit against the rules of the programme and we do not have the flexibility to move away from that.<\/p> <p>  The results of those audits come to our audit, finance and risk sub-committee and we discuss many of them in detail.  It is fair to say the percentage of groups to which we go back to recoup moneys or against which there might be negative findings is very small.  However, there might be findings that relate to governance, to how decisions were made or to how persons were accounting for the moneys.  It is about trying to improve the practice of the groups when they receive the reports or where they get some supports from us as well around these broader issues, and we use these reports to inform some of that.<\/p> <p>  On the manager piece, while I will come back to the Deputy directly later, there should be no liability on a group locally in respect of someone coming to retirement age.  As for people seeking redundancy, we take a firm view that the contract with the individual is between the local group and the individual.  The support that exists, from a community services point of view, is a subsidy to the programme.  Because they sign up to this concept of community supports, it is expected that local groups would have a level of matching funding or income they would raise from an enterprise they are running and that they themselves would then run the programme.  On the redundancy piece, if someone was looking for redundancy or if an organisation had to make people redundant, it is an issue that must be worked through the local mechanisms from a governance point of view.  All the groups must provide a three-year business plan and a big part of our testing and working through those business case studies pertains to sustainability.  We do not always get it right but we do in the vast majority of cases, in trying to ensure they will be sustainable for those three years.  In that sense, we would not foresee that there would be a need for redundancy.  It is, however, the call of the local group in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins raised issues in terms of the Leader programme.  We are all familiar with the issues that relate to the Leader programme in terms of the slow take-up and throughput of projects.  To clarify, our role in it was to assess initially the plans that were developed by each of the local action groups, LAGs.  Second, it was to develop an ICT system to support the development of the Leader programme and third, we were required by the Department to carry out Article 48 checks at a central level on the Leader plans.  The Article 48 checks are often the issue thrown up as being part of the delay and our turnaround time for any such checks that come before us is ten days.  Moreover, we have kept to that over the past couple of years.  However, I am aware that there are delays at a local level and nationally.  There have been some changes made in the past number of months that have helped to speed up the process and we have noticed a good increase in the number of Article 48 checks coming to us to be done.  In that regard, there will be a significant change over the next period but I accept there has been much difficulty and frustration in trying to roll this out on a local basis.<\/p> <p>  I might turn to my colleague on the point the Deputy raised on the fishermen and farmers with regard to the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":869,"content":"<p>It is likely that Deputy Michael Collins is referring to the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":870,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00500","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I will make two points about the targeting there.  First, there is a nationally set number of groupings that the programme is to target but each local area, through the local community development committee, LCDC, is also given authority to add a target group locally if it is appropriate.  That was open as a local opportunity.  Although I might be wrong on this, I suggest that probably the reason they felt they did not need to add fishermen and farmers was that the programme now includes a target for low-income families.  There was much discussion about farmers and fishermen.  The intention always had been that the farmers and fishermen who had been targeted in previous programmes were to be those on low income.  The idea was that targeting of low-income families should allow any low-income farmer or fisherman, in west Cork or any other area, to be a perfectly valid recipient of supports through the programmes.  There certainly should be no reason that such work cannot continue with those groups in SICAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":872,"content":"<p>On that basis, we lost a specific worker.

I certainly concur with Deputy Michael Collins that the Leader programme is posing difficulties for many community groups.  One of Pobal's roles is to protect the services and support the community groups.  Could an intervention be made to call for a review of Leader in light of all the complaints that are coming in?  We have raised this at this committee previously and a review is warranted at this point.<\/p> <p>  The T&uacute;s schemes throughout the State are doing fantastic work.  From speaking to participants in my constituency of Offaly, I am aware they are enjoying the schemes and are attaining valuable skills on them.  I could not compliment them enough.  A number of supervisors from T&uacute;s schemes have met me recently, however, and raised serious concerns about how the JobPath scheme is taking some employees from them.  People are very unhappy.  The supervisors are unhappy but the participants, who had been enjoying their T&uacute;s scheme, are suddenly being pulled away and forced into employment in which they are unhappy and are not attaining valuable skills.  This must be addressed.  I took up this issue with the Taoiseach last year when he was Minister for Social Protection.  It must be addressed because it is causing huge dissatisfaction among the participants and we want to safeguard the schemes.<\/p> <p>  The T&uacute;s schemes have been doing fantastic work.

I would like to take a step back, as this is a relatively new committee and my questions are not as specific as are some others.  What is the witnesses' definition of \"community\"?  What do community and community development mean to Pobal?  Is Pobal succeeding in the community-centred approach?<\/p> <p>  I am from Tramore, County Waterford, and always have been very active in my local community.  One issue that is repeatedly raised by members of the community is that smaller groups that are already relatively embedded in the community are buckling under the weight of administration.  Such groups are small and have ambition but they believe there is a time-consuming burden upon them and they have to go through hoops and loops to access support funding.  What can be done to support such smaller groups that are developing but are wasting too much time or missing opportunities because of the administrative burden?<\/p> <p>  Another issue which has been raised pertains to personal professional development, such as continuing professional development, CPD, in the early childhood development sector.  There is a sense that remuneration is low for what staff are putting in but that may be somewhat mitigated if there were more funding and support for professional development programmes.  Not only would such people have something more to offer to their communities but there would be an appreciation of what they do and that they are moving towards more professional academic qualifications and would then have more to offer to organisations such as Pobal.<\/p> <p>  There is a sense that the outcomes to which Pobal looks are very prescribed.  The area of climate change was mentioned by the Chair.  As a society, we will have to adapt not just to environmental but also social and cultural changes.  I wonder about the ability to have emerging, rather than prescribed, outcomes.  We will need a society that is able to adapt, emerge and be creative.  People in the community are our leaders and we should be looking to them as to how to develop our programmes.  They should not have a sense of being told what is wanted from them and that they should not exercise too much creativity because that does not work for the organisation.  I would like for there to be more development in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#E00400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Pobal sees community as every town, village and city across the country but we look at it through a lens of social inclusion, equality, where the areas of greatest disadvantage are and from where the resources to address those issues will come.  We work with the Government to target those areas through that lens.  While some programmes may have a more universal element, most have a targeted element to assist those who need supports to have a better quality of life in terms of engagements with society, while taking into account people's broader issues people.<\/p> <p>  On community development, which also relates to the Senator's latter point, it is very much a bottom-up approach.  Needs are identified at a local level and plans are then worked through to respond to those needs.  That is our definition of community development.  However, we sometimes struggle with defining or working through the programmes as to how they might match that in the most effective way because there is a clear requirement for accountability for the funding and taxpayers' money spent on each area.  Trying to get that match can be difficult.<\/p> <p>  To return to the Senator's point on people's creativity or innovation in responding to their local needs, a key challenge for us is that because an idea does not fit a particular box there may be no scope for it to be funded or worked through.  We will address that challenge over the course of our next strategic plan and the next few years in terms of matching that in a better way.  However, we are constrained in respect of data protection, public accountability for moneys spent and the various circulars on how that must be accounted for.<\/p><p>As I said in my statement, Pobal has evolved over a number of years.

As an organisation working on behalf of the Government, we are channelling many services through local communities.  If we do not actively support them, we will all lose, including communities.  The senior alert scheme is a good example of where there has been a series of changes in legislation which have lead to more onerous demands being placed on groups.  Garda vetting is one such demand.  The group is linking directly with vulnerable older people in their homes and the law now provides that the person who goes to people's homes has to be vetted.  That is a large additional burden on a group.  We have tried to put processes in place in order that we can make these arrangements for groups in order that they will not have to carry all of the bureaucracy.  We have also taken other bits of the bureaucracy off them that they had to manage in the past, in particular finding all of their own equipment and going through tendering processes.  We now control these things centrally.  We have worked with local volunteer centres to make the Garda vetting process available to them.  The feedback we are getting is that once people have been through the training process, the committees see that they have to be on board in dealing with the issues they might have viewed as a burden previously.  We are the messengers and the face of the centre for groups and making these demands.<\/p> <p>  On further professional development in the early years sector, I point to two things.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been providing money for us for a number of years for an active learner fund that offers direct funding for training for people within the early years sector.  It has been an effective fund and very useful for people within the sector.  I flag that there is work ongoing between us and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to look at the further need for professional development and how it could be delivered.  It is a need which is very much a recognised within the sector.  We are aware that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is looking at it and we will be supporting it in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>Like the rest of my colleagues around the table, I am delighted to meet the delegates.

This is seriously curtailing the benefit that can be delivered by the schemes.  It is something of which the Leader groups and those administering the rural social scheme are acutely aware.  I remember back in 2007 and 2008 that it boiled down to who prepared traffic management plans.  The Leader groups or companies trained somebody to prepare the plans which previously had been signed off on by the council engineer.  However, they were told that they could not do so.  It nullifies and negates much of the positive work that is being done and that can be done.  It may not be the role of Pobal to sort it out, but it has a responsibility, with the local authority groups and Leader companies, to put something in place quickly to prevent the demise of the schemes and their benefit to the areas in question.  That is not a criticism but a comment on something that is hitting us hard in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Last week my group in Belclare in Tuam, County Galway received its paperwork to fill in for next year's rural social scheme programme.  I compared it to what had happened in the first year the scheme was run in terms of the documentation required from the sponsoring group.  I question the need for some of it.  It has applied for so many years to seek to provide a scheme, a work schedule, in engaging with the supervisor and the Leader company.  Every year there is an additional request that something else be provided.  For instance, this year groups have to provide health and safety plans.  The sponsoring and local voluntary groups are being burdened with a huge responsibility.  It is turning people against getting involved and signing their names on a piece of paper on behalf of a sponsoring group.  Some body, be it Pobal, the Leader company or the Department, needs to play a role in taking it back.  They should be sorting out the insurance issue rather than telling us why it cannot be sorted out.  Pobal should play a role in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#F00500","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1517396400,"counter":885,"content":"<p>Deputy Joe Carey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":886,"content":"<p>Pobal oversees the spending of a lot of money.  When we undertake a project, we are asked if we delivered value for money.  If, for example, an engineer was to write a letter to say value for money had been achieved, is it the kind of thing Pobal would accept?  I know that the schemes do achieve value for money.  Any money spent on them, including the social inclusion and activation programme, SICAP, the rural social scheme or the community employment scheme, probably represents the best value for money achieved for any public money spent.  I would like to see it being proved, rather than making a bald statement they did achieve value for money.  From a political point of view, we need to see the value that can be achieved with a small amount of money.  With a little more money the schemes could achieve so much more for communities.  For the participants it is very important that this kind of stuff is being spoken about.<\/p> <p>  I find that when participants aged 55 plus are told that they have to go off a scheme, they do not find other gainful employment . Someone who is 30 years old may be brought onto the scheme who might be in a better position to find employment.  I ask Pobal to take on board the issues people who are part-time farmers face on rural social schemes.  When they reach the age of 55 years, they should be allowed to remain on the scheme until they reach pension age.  That would provide stability in the numbers of participants involved.<\/p><p>We are to increase numbers on the rural social scheme.  We are meant to double them over the next two years.  We also need to ensure we bring the threshold down to 55 or 56.  If an individual at that age does not have employment then he or she can remain on the scheme until he or she gets the pension.  They are small things that mean an awful lot to people.  I commend the witnesses on the work they do and on the profile of the work they do.

I accept his last point.  We need to be better at illustrating the impact of all these ranges of work and the value given to the people involved as well.  They need to see and hear about it from others.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the rural social scheme and the issue of insurance.  I have heard about it from a wide number of people as well.  We have a firm role in providing a help desk, a payroll service and training in the social rural scheme.  We are guided by the rules set by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  However, I undertake to ensure we raise it and try to get it addressed.  This issue has been raised with us in Pobal.  I know it is coming more and more to the fore in terms of groups taking responsibility for insurance.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the documentation that groups receive, the rural social scheme was mentioned but we could apply it to many schemes and programmes we are involved in.  We are tied again by the regulatory and legislative frameworks.  We cannot do some of these things for the groups.  Mr. Murphy gave an example of the senior alerts where we can take on some of that and take away some of the burden.  However, there are some things, especially relating to health and safety or other items that the groups themselves have to own.  What we need to look at there, and we have done it at times, is providing more comprehensive training and support to groups.  That is something we will be trying to address over the next three years as well.  I refer to Pobal being out there much more, involved in regional seminars, working with groups on particular themes and looking at templates that are there.  <\/p> <p>  We cannot work through those templates with people but at least we can hopefully provide them with the materials.  We do that on many programmes.  Doing more of that is where we need to concentrate and take away some of that burden from groups.  How we deliver value for money is my first question everyday.  The value of the work going on on the ground across the country is critical.  We are a management and administrative framework to that.  It is incumbent upon us to be as lean as possible in how we provide that service.  We measure the administration costs of the overall programme costs.  Those are declining.  <\/p> <p>  We also look at better ways of doing our work.  Technology has been extremely important to us over the last number of years.  I refer to online portals and online engagement with groups.  That throws up issues as well, especially in areas where broadband is not particularly strong or people do not have the resources to engage.  However, we have two sets of support available.  Most are online but paper versions are also available to the groups that cannot engage with that.  We ensure we are getting as much efficiency as possible through applying technology to the changes and we are continuing to do that.  There is much more technology that can make us lean into the future.<\/p> <p>  Most of our resources and staff are actually out on the ground.  The community and early years side of things involves meeting groups and involvement through regional supports.  They are one-to-one supports through the groups.  To lessen the burden on the groups is part of the critical infrastructure.  I will come to Mr. Murphy in respect of the outputs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":889,"content":"<p>We take seriously our role in trying to assist the groups on the ground in demonstrating the value of what they do.  It is all very well for a group in a local area to be doing something.  However, the message needs to get out and it needs to be joined with the messages from the other groups around what works, what does not and what they are producing for Government.  We have invested heavily in systems, support structures and in data collection to try to give those messages.  At times, it is not popular locally because we are asking them to give us information.  However, when the benefit is seen of putting that information together to demonstrate to Government the value of their programme, people then see it is all about maintaining investment.<\/p> <p>  I will use the social inclusion and community activation plan, SICAP, as an example.  That was raised earlier.  There is an information system now in SICAP that allows us not only know what each group is doing but exactly who they are doing it with and to prove that, for example, in terms of the targeting issue that was raised earlier, we know we are working with the most disadvantaged people.  We also know what services they are getting and how they have moved from unemployment to employment.  Mr Leamy mentioned earlier in his opening address that our relationship with organisations like the ESRI is important to us.  We work closely with the ESRI.  It objectively and independently looks at the figures and what is happening.  It has been able to make very strong statements that the programme is working with the most disadvantaged and that it is producing a series of outputs. <\/p> <p>  I will point members as well to one of the documents going around.  It is called \"Kickboxing kindness and going the extra mile\".  It is an example of good practice not always being about numbers and figures.  It is about dealing with people with particular types of issues, how local groups have successfully managed to do that and then drawing those lessons out to give elsewhere.

I will make a few general comments and maybe the witnesses can give me a sense of their thoughts on issues that have not been raised.<\/p> <p>  My first thought is an issue that I have raised at length with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  I refer to support for boards, voluntary bodies and voluntary people.  I am happy to hear the witnesses say they are committed to ensuring there is more comprehensive training and support for volunteers.  That is hugely important.  Volunteers and all of those involved in different boards right across the country give huge service and time.  They have to grapple with all sorts of form filling and trying to deal with a burden of responsibility as well.  It is crucial that there is enhanced training and support, as required, for those groups.<\/p> <p>  Another relevant point I have noticed in the few years I have been in this new role is that the most organised groups are able to benefit most from funding.  While that is important, we also need to look at groups that find it a little bit difficult.  Not every village and town is going to have people very organised, committed to filling out the paperwork and committed then to getting back more questions that require more paperwork.  I see it with regard to funding that has been approved.  I am thinking of Roscommon and Galway.<\/p><p>I would like to see other areas getting a fair share, but I think the issue comes back to people within those communities being organised, ready to go and having projects that are ready to be submitted.  That all fits under the community services programme etc.  That is an important point, one that I have raised at length with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring.<\/p><p> I have some experience of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in my area.  We have two rural men's groups within County Roscommon.  They are fantastic in terms of ticking the boxes for social inclusion.  The groups are made up of older men, many of whom are living on their own.  This is an important network and outlet for them on a weekly basis.  However, I am currently of the understanding that these groups do not fit under SICAP.  It goes back to the comments made by Mr. Leamy and Mr. Murphy.  They said it is a question of looking at needs within different communities and at what social inclusion means in different communities.  Certainly, in my view, social inclusion means providing funding and support for those groups.  Those groups are still operating but they are being run on a shoestring.  More individualised criteria specific to communities should fit under SICAP.<\/p><p> My third point has been stated several times.  It relates to the challenge for the rural social scheme and the T&uacute;s scheme and the importance of these schemes for the people who are participating in the communities.  There is a difficulty with people being taken off schemes and that is a major problem.  We know extra places were allocated for the rural social scheme last year.  That is great but in my area it has been difficult to recruit people.  It is fine having extra places but it is a problem if we do not have people to fill them.  It is obviously positive that we have more people back in employment.  That is great.  However, there is a gap.  Deputy Canney stated clearly that there is a gap, especially with people in their late 50s or early 60s who may find it difficult to get employment elsewhere.  That is certainly a point the Pobal representatives should take from today &ndash; I realise they are aware of it anyway.<\/p><p> I wish to comment on a more positive level about my recent experience with regard to the seniors alert scheme.  The changes made are having a real impact in terms of the people being able to access alarms more easily.  As the Pobal representatives have said, more support is being given to link people within different areas.  That is important and perhaps it is a template Pobal can use for other programmes.<\/p><p> My final question is on the presentation made.  I come from a rural area.  The Pobal representatives indicated that, based on the 2016 deprivation index, small towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 residents have been worst affected during the past ten years.  We know that.  The Pobal representatives also attested to the need for further targeted initiatives in those areas.  What future plans does Pobal have to try to target those continuing challenges in towns and villages?<\/p><p> I will go back to my first point.  I think we need to take a fresh look at how we support communities that are not as well organised as others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#G00500","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":893,"content":"<p>I will start with the last point from Senator Hopkins.  That is part of the discussion we are always having.  There is a call for applications.  We see applications coming from some of the usual groups that are well-organised.  These groups can write submissions well and can meet the criteria or examine the criteria and match it well.<\/p> <p>  That is why we are relying more on other tools that identify areas of disadvantage and the groups that are most disadvantaged.  The idea is that we are not solely relying on what is submitted to us.  We have other tests.  Senator Hopkins referred to the deprivation index.  The index is one criterion used within some programmes.  We are keen to see it used in more programmes but it is up to Departments to agree to it.  Increasingly, Departments are using the deprivation index to help identify where resources should go.  It is taken into account when examining the appraisal of some of the applications.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to some areas that may not have strong capacity.  We have capacity events to support groups.  The work includes building business plans.  For example, under the community services programme, an applicant is required to have a three-year business plan.  Sometimes we might work with a group over a year or two years to improve capacity at pre-development stage.  This can enable groups to apply for the community services programme and they can sustain themselves in the programme.  That is done over a period.  Anyway, I fully accept the Senator's point: we need to continue improving this area and looking for other ways to assess where the moneys should be going.<\/p> <p>  When we do geographical testing throughout the country there is a reasonable match.  Some areas lose out more than others but there is a reasonable match in terms of the resources matching the areas of disadvantage and where the target groups are.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the remarks of Senator Hopkins on the seniors alert scheme.  I take the point made by the Senator.  It is a consideration of ours.  We have seen how the seniors alert scheme has worked.  We have taken some lessons from it and we are learning how to apply them to other programmes we are involved in.

It was the case up to 1 January that they could not apply but now they are eligible, subject to the fact that SICAP funding overall is aimed at addressing disadvantage.  The funding would need to be for those over 65 years in a disadvantaged area.  Disadvantage is the common factor for all SICAP funding.  Anyway, those over 65 years are now included.<\/p> <p>  This is a good example of the fact that as we have left the economic crisis, the Government has had an ability to move on.  The last programme was focused on getting people into jobs.  The entire allocation was skewed towards working-age people who were unemployed.  However, as we have moved away from that, the Government has been able to broaden the categorisation.  I hope that example will be useful for Senator Hopkins.<\/p> <p>  The issue of supports for boards and volunteers was raised.  We accept absolutely that it is critical for relevant infrastructure to be supported.  Pobal tries to undertake a series of practical roles.

When we write guidance material, we try to ensure it is accessible to the groups that most need the money.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate my earlier point about the fact that so many more legislative demands arise now regarding data protection, child protection and so on and we have to face up to them.  If we do not, we could potentially be putting groups into a difficult position.  For example, let us suppose a group took on the management of money.  Then, three years later an audit is done and someone says the group did not obey the law.  We have to cover all those areas.  We try to act as a bridge so that there is at least a translation of the materials to make them as accessible as possible.<\/p> <p>  The scheme to support national organisations operates through Pobal.  It is a Government scheme organised through the Department of Rural and Community Affairs.  The scheme funds several umbrella groups.  One function of these groups is to be as supportive as possible, especially to communities of interest throughout the country that fit under particular types of headings, including headings of disability, educational or young people.<\/p><p>A range of communities are covered.  This is close to our hearts and the philosophy of what we need to be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.  I will ask a few questions, although I do not wish to repeat what has already been said.  I value Pobal's work.  Its role is critical.  Community development is close to my heart.  I have worked with communities across County Clare and tried to help them navigate their way through the various issues that arise from time to time.<\/p> <p>  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have dedicated lines to particular Departments to ask about medical cards, social welfare benefits and so on.  Would Pobal consider setting up a unit that Oireachtas Members could dial?  There are many programmes under Pobal's remit, but Members could target their queries and speak to the relevant person or section.<\/p> <p>  There are quite a few groups, including some large ones, involved in the community services programme, CSP, in Clare.  There is a cap of 315 groups.  Is that moveable?  Pobal is considering whether to have more programme groups.  The witnesses might take us through the possibility of new groups forming and applying for the programme in their villages of communities.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the comments on volunteers, voluntary boards and committees and their community development work, which is significant.  Without their input, we would not have the communities that we do today.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Hopkins about the burdens that have been placed on community groups in terms of filling out forms.  One community could be far ahead because of its people, so I would welcome more training sessions, information evenings and the like to upskill volunteers so that they might get the best out of the system.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hopkins also asked about the 2016 deprivation index and highlighted small towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 people.  The witnesses stated that further targeted initiatives were needed.  What targeted initiatives have worked to date, could they be expanded or are new ones required?  What should the Department be considering and how could improvements be made?<\/p> <p>  Has Pobal received contact from the men's shed movement?  It is widespread and large.  The witnesses referred to social inclusion, interaction, mental health and so on, and the men's shed movement encapsulates a great deal of positivity in that respect.

I will need to check, but my understanding is that Oireachtas queries come through that line as well.  We will get the number for the Chairman before the meeting finishes and email it to him.  We deal with many queries on an ongoing basis as well as representations from Members of the Oireachtas.  It can sometimes be difficult for Members to raise individual sensitive issues, so we tend to deal with many queries on that basis.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the Senator for not reverting to her regarding initiatives in respect of towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 people.  It may be time to consider more targeted initiatives.  When I was writing my presentation, I was thinking of how we used to be involved in a number of dedicated programmes to small towns or areas within cities or some rural areas, for example, RAPID.  A new RAPID programme is being directly managed by the Department through local authorities.  Our experience of RAPID, especially in provincial towns, was positive.  It was not just about the money.  While money helped, of more importance was the agencies, each of which had a budget head, working together on the issues that pertained to the areas in question.  They were instructed to share resources and focus on the key targets in each town.  They then had to account to an implementation body in the town itself, which in turn had to report to a national monitoring committee comprising all Departments.<\/p> <p>  I am not saying that we need to replicate them exactly, but these were the types of targeted initiative that worked, especially in smaller areas.  Many areas identified different issues to be addressed, so this model allowed for a bit of innovation and creativity.  There was a small amount of funding to animate that or match-fund something that an agency or community representatives might have devised.  I neglected to mention that a good number of community representatives also sat around that table.  They were informing the process and challenging what they were hearing around the table.<\/p> <p>  These are the types of targeted initiative that we had in mind, but there could be others relating to, for example, people with disabilities.  We are involved in one under the Ability programme through the Department of Employment and Social Protection.  We were also involved in the Equality for Women Measure, EWM.  That programme tended to be extremely bureaucratic because of the EU dimension, but if there was one without the bureaucratic dimension that focused on gender-specific issues, it would be useful and appropriate at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":898,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked a specific question about the CSP and its entry points.  There have been no such opportunities in recent years because there has been no money, but an additional budget was identified by the Department during 2017.  The process is ongoing.  Thirty-three applications have reached the final stage and the Department is making a final decision.  My understanding is that announcements will be made on new entries in February.  There is no new set of money to follow that up of which we are aware, but we hope that the new entries will bring new thoughts, ideas and blood to the programme.<\/p> <p>  A number of men's sheds are funded through programmes that are ultimately administered by Pobal.  That it has taken off as a national movement is amazing, as are the supports it offers.  I will focus on the local issue, though, as it may be something that we have not got across enough at this meeting even though it is an important part of our ethos.  Of the moneys that Pobal is involved in designing schemes around or overseeing, a large amount ends up within local umbrella structures that make allocations to groups like men's sheds.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, was referenced as an example.  On average, each local community development committee is allocated approximately &euro;1 million.  All of the roll-outs are handled through local development companies.  While we work with the Department to set the national structure, targets and planning processes and set up the ICT element, decisions are made locally about which groups they want to work with.  A significant number are deciding that they want to work with groups like men's sheds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":899,"content":"<p>Are committee members satisfied with all of that?

I am the chief executive of Bord Scann&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, the Irish Film Board.  Anyone who has stayed in a cinema after a film is over to watch the credits will know how many people it takes to make a film.  People working on films include writers, directors, producers, actors, camera operators, set designers, costume designers, hair and make-up, electricians, set construction supervisors and crews, location managers, editors, post production supervisors, music composers and performers, animators and visual effects artists, equipment hire, transport and a range of specialist services depending on the particular needs of each feature film, television drama or television animation project.  These teams are assembled for each project and then work for varying lengths of time on the project, both because of the particular needs of each project - for example, an actor with a small part is only needed for a day or two - and because of the overall scale of the project.  A lower budget feature film produced for &euro;1.5 million and supported with IFB funding will have a four to six week pre-production period, a four week shoot and eight to 12 weeks post production.  A ten by one hour television series made for more than $2 million an episode will have months of pre-production and a shooting period of at least six months, if not considerably more, and further months of post-production.  A television animation series can take two years to make.  Each time the creative and technical team is assembled and then each member of the team goes his or her separate ways when his or her particular part of the work is done and-or the overall project is completed.<\/p> <p>  Film studios do not employ on a full-time long-term basis all the creative and technical personnel needed for the production of films and television dramas.  In most places, including Hollywood, film studios operate on the basis that a small team of staff manage the infrastructure of the studio and rent out the premises to production companies which then organise their creative and technical teams for the project which is using the studios.  Sometimes service companies are based in the studios but they too are renters of the space.  This is the case with all the studio space in the EU, including the UK and Ireland.  As demand for screen content has increased, there is a more regular, if not a constant, flow of production through the studios - this is particularly true most recently in Ireland - which results in regular work for many of those involved.<\/p> <p>  The competition in getting productions to locate in a particular territory is intense.  As a result only those territories with strong skills bases, suitable infrastructure and competitive financial incentives are able to attract that work.  Ireland has been very successful in this area in recent years.  As well as a vibrant film production sector made primarily on location and indigenously driven.  It also has three major television series currently operating in Ireland, one each in Ardmore Studios and Ashford Studios both in Wicklow, and Troy Studios in Limerick.  The feature film, television drama and television animation sector alone has an estimated annual spend in Ireland on personnel working in Ireland and goods and services sourced in Ireland of approximately &euro;250 million.  This is on top of what broadcasters, including RT&Eacute;, and other producers of screen content spend on the programmes they make largely for the local audience.<\/p><p>It is estimated there are more than 17,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the sector and the gross value added of the sector exceeds &euro;1 billion annually.  Detailed figures are expected to be published shortly in the Department-commissioned Olsberg SPI report.  It is understood the report will make recommendations for the sector to promote its growth and development over the next five years.  Also recently published is the BAI-IFB Crowe Horwath report on a strategy for the development of skills for the audiovisual sector.  This report, a copy of which has been circulated to the members of the committee, has a number of recommendations on training and education which are being worked on by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p> The Irish Film Board has a dual remit of supporting the culture of film and screen content production and the promotion of an industry for making film and screen content in Ireland.  Last week we launched our production catalogue for 2018 and we provided the committee with a link to it.  It has details of the following levels of production.  In 2017, the Irish Film Board provided funding for the production of 16 feature films, five creative co-production feature films, 13 feature documentaries, five animation TV projects, 21 short films and the cinema release of 27 feature films in Irish cinemas.  The IFB also provides development funding for all these forms of production and is the largest public funder of creative development, which is the equivalent of research and development funding, for the feature film, TV drama and TV animation sector.  In addition, there has been a particular focus on production in the regions, with film and TV dramas shooting in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Roscommon as well as in the Dublin-Wicklow region.<\/p><p> The Irish Film Board also includes Screen Training Ireland which undertakes a range of activities in training in the audiovisual production sector.  In light of the Crowe Horwath report, Screen Training Ireland is working on plans for the development of training across the audiovisual production sector and is engaging with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the development of its training services.  The IFB has published a report, Screen Training Ireland &ndash; A Year in Review 2017, and a link to it has been provided to the committee.  In the report, under the heading &ldquo;Looking Ahead: 2018 and Beyond&rdquo;, Screen Training Ireland sets out its work plan for 2018.<\/p><p> There are huge opportunities given the greatly increased demand for screen content worldwide.  There was a report today in the newspapers that Netflix, Hulu and Amazon will spend $10 billion a year on screen content TV series production in each of the next five years.  This is an enormous opportunity for Ireland.  As a central part of the creative industries, the sector can create a strong developmental environment for growth and job creation in Ireland.  In the five years from 2011 to 2016, employment at least doubled in film, television and animation production and it is anticipated that in the next five years it could, with the proper supports, double again.<\/p><p> The IFB hopes that with the publication of the two reports referred to earlier and the implementation of the strategies set out in them, the sector will continue to deliver on pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme promoted by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht of making Ireland a centre of excellence for media production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Hickey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I am employed by SIPTU as the divisional organiser for the services division.  Irish Equity and the film and entertainment section of the union sit under the umbrella of the services division and the arts and culture sector within that.  Today I will present on behalf of Irish Equity and my colleague, Mr. Graham Macken, will present on behalf of the film and entertainment section of SIPTU.  I will be happy to take questions on either presentation if the committee desires.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Equity group was established in 1949 to organise and represent actors in the Republic of Ireland with the objective of securing decent working conditions for actors.  On 9 September 1979, the Irish Equity group merged with the then ITGWU, which is now SIPTU, and became the cultural division of the ITGWU.  Currently, Irish Equity sits within the arts and culture sector of the services division of SIPTU and the day-to-day work is overseen by an executive committee of Irish Equity made up of members of Irish Equity who are elected annually at the AGM of Irish Equity.<\/p> <p>  Irish Equity has presented previously to the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the previous occasion being November 2017 to discuss bullying and harassment in the live performance sector of the arts.  At that time the union made a number of recommendations to ensure that culture change is achievable and sustainable, including that there should be direct co-operation and engagement between Irish Equity, arts organisations and training bodies to develop and monitor best practice in the industry; that the Minister should encourage theatre organisations to establish a representative umbrella body that can engage with stakeholders collectively on industry matters; extending the cover of the protected disclosures legislation to cover reporting of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment; that drama schools and arts colleges should develop at least one module on dignity in the workplace and creating a positive workplace culture; and that all applicants for public funding should have to have good practice and policy in place as a prerequisite for access to such funding.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the film and TV sector, I will outline the main issues affecting performers.  On the issue of bullying and harassment, it is interesting to note that the recent sexual harassment allegations in Ireland to date have related to the live performance sector with no evidence or allegations of sexual harassment having arisen from the film or TV sector here in the Republic.  That does not mean that bullying and harassment issues do not exist within the sector which is why Irish Equity invited line managers, producers, directors etc. from the audiovisual sector to attend an industry seminar at the end of 2017 on bullying in the industry.  The objective was to assist them with developing good practices and procedures in this regard.  The seminar was jointly held with Screen Training Ireland, SPI, and the Irish Film Board, as previously discussed at this committee.<\/p> <p>  Sustaining careers and living conditions is the most difficult part for performers.  The outstanding issues for actors in the industry relate strongly to their capacity to maintain themselves as performers and to have any kind of longevity in the industry.  The barriers to this are mainly structural and the Government certainly has the capacity to deal with it.  It is notable that these barriers also have a more significant effect on women performers.<\/p> <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Culture 2025 framework policy document published in 2016 identifies seven pillars for priority, one of which is to foster creativity by examining existing systems and supports with a view to helping more people pursue sustainable careers in the cultural and heritage sectors.  It is our considered opinion that achieving this objective means demonstrating meaningful commitment to the value of the arts in society and, consequently, the status of the artist.<\/p> <p>  In October 1980, the general conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, otherwise known as UNESCO, made a recommendation concerning the status of the artist which needs to be recognised.  The recommendation specifically invites member states to promote and protect the status of artists by considering artistic activity, including innovation and research, as a service to the community.  Member states should make it possible for them to enjoy the esteem necessary for the full development of their work and provide the economic safeguards to which artists are entitled as people actively engaged in cultural work.  This includes the need to improve the social recognition of artists by according them the moral and material support required to remedy their difficulties.  In practical terms, this means taking the necessary steps to see that artists enjoy the same rights as are conferred on others by national and international legislation in respect of employment and living and working conditions, and should see that self-employed artists enjoy protection as regards income and social security.  For this to be meaningful, there would have to be special provision and recognition for artists at the level of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Revenue.<\/p> <p>  Performers are one of the hardest working groups when it comes to seeking work as it is in their nature to be constantly seeking to create and perform.  They seek work themselves, have agents seeking work on their behalf and create work through all manner of profit share and low-budget initiatives, but when it comes to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection they are treated poorly and disrespectfully and when it comes to Revenue they are treated harshly.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not take the acting profession seriously and frequently tries to force performers into non-artistic work.  Even where performers undertake training to increase their suitability for various types of engagement, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection considers that they are not actively seeking work during this period and withdraws or refuses to pay jobseeker's benefit or protection.<\/p><p>Revenue consistently fails to acknowledge the genuine costs of staying in the profession when it comes to assessing genuinely incurred expenses.  We need to develop some clear parameters around this to support and assist artists in pursuing sustainable careers in the cultural and heritage sectors as per priority No. 7 in the framework policy document.<\/p><p> The freelance nature of the work of actors also needs to be recognised so as to extend to them the same protections given to persons engaged on a contract of service.  This is why Irish Equity has advocated and continues to advocate for the need to change the definition of to whom the employment legislation applies so as to say \"worker\", as it does in the Industrial Relations Acts, and not \"employee\", as it does in other workplace legislation.<\/p><p> Screen Training Ireland operates under the auspices of the Film Board and offers a comprehensive range of training courses for the industry.  However, we would like to see these courses expanded to include training or upskilling for performers.<\/p><p> There exists a film and TV sector stakeholder forum that operates largely within the control of the Irish Film Board.  This forum is not effectively used, however, and we would like to change this in favour of a jointly-led union and industry forum.  This highlights the general global issues of concern of Irish Equity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karan O'Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":915,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it and speak with it about working conditions and the development of the Irish film industry.  I am the chief executive of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, which is the national representative organisation of independent film, television and animation production companies.  As employers in the Irish creative industries, our members comprise a range of production companies from young first-time producers to producers of large-scale high-end film and TV drama.  Productions include work such as \"Vikings\", \"Ripper Street\", \"Penny Dreadful\", \"Room to Improve\", \"Red Rock\", \"Ros na R&uacute;n\" and \"Nowhere Fast\", as well as Oscar nominated films such as \"Room\" and \"Brooklyn\".  We hope the report conducted by Olsberg SPI Limited - no relation - on the economic analysis of our screen-based creative industries will be published soon.  In its absence, to give the committee a sense of scale of the industry, \"Penny Dreadful\" alone employed 1,200 cast and crew over the course of production.  This is a similar number to that currently employed by Diageo in Ireland.  In addition, the combined expenditure of \"Penny Dreadful\" and \"Ripper Street\" in Ireland in the period during production was more than &euro;50 million.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has a long history of supporting its film and television industry through fiscal incentives.  The section 481 tax incentive is essential in supporting Ireland's production landscape.  It has a positive impact on both indigenously produced content and attracting incoming productions, resulting in the creation of high-end jobs and contributing to Ireland's reputation as a global, high-tech, digital and creative content hub.<\/p> <p>  In 2016 Irish productions committed to spend &euro;265 million in the Irish economy as a direct result of section 481-certified projects.  This was the highest level ever achieved since the incentive commenced and demonstrates the amount of inward investment the independent production sector can attract into Ireland.  Incoming high-end TV drama remains the biggest contributor to this activity.  It increased from &euro;28 million in 2011 to &euro;161 million in 2016.  This year, SPI calls on the Government to extend section 481 in its current form beyond 2020.  The extension and continuation of the section 481 incentive is even more important when considering the limited sources of other national funding and the support required, in particular, for indigenous productions.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Film Board plays an integral role in the success of the local economy, providing funding and support for indigenous productions, as well as some incoming ones.  Between 2008 and 2015, capital funding for the Irish Film Board decreased by more than 40% and the Oireachtas grant for 2016 was &euro;11.7 million.  By comparison, Northern Ireland Screen's annual investment in production is budgeted at &euro;16.3 million, and this in a market significantly smaller than that of the Republic of Ireland.  We seek the reinstatement of that funding to 2008 levels of &euro;20 million.<\/p> <p>  As mentioned earlier, incoming high-end TV drama contributes significantly to the industry but the industry comprises a range of production companies, with budgets ranging from less than &euro;1 million to producers of large-scale high-end TV drama with budgets of over &euro;20 million.  Production activity is made up of a small number of large productions and a large number of small to medium-budget productions.  The pipeline of productions required to ensure growth and sustainability of the industry ideally should consist of incoming high-end TV drama and film along with indigenous Irish productions.  This balance would ensure a consistent pipeline of projects for a range of company sizes and employee skill sets.<\/p> <p>  An Irish producer company employs core full-time staff who work in the areas of production, development, administration, sales and marketing.  They develop original projects and go to markets to secure the finance required to make the production.  The core staff are involved at all stages of the production, a process that can often take up to three or four years.  Crew are hired at the production stage.  Crew recruitment levels and type are dependent on the available budget and, of course, genre of project.  For example, a large-scale period drama would require a large crew with a particular skill set for this genre and the crew could be hired for six months at a time, while a medium budget film would employ a much smaller number of crew members for a shorter duration, possibly eight to ten weeks.<\/p> <p>  A production company could have several projects in development at any one time over the course of a year but it is possible that only one or two of the projects actually get to production stage.  The timing for production of the project is dependent on available national and international funding.  Due to the project-based nature of our industry, a single production company cannot provide full-time employment for 52 weeks of the year to production crew.  However, the combined total of independent production companies can and do provide significant employment.<\/p> <p>  The employment status of those working in the industry comprises a mix of PAYE and self-employed.  Rates of pay and general terms of conditions of employment have been collectively negotiated between SPI and the ICTU-recognised film group of unions.  The minimum rates of pay listed in these agreements for the industry are well above the average industrial wage.  The majority of people working in the industry are, in fact, paid in excess of the agreed minimum rates.  Construction crew rates are above the most recent sectoral employment order, which is new legislation from October 2017, for the construction industry and the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, electrical minimum rates are above the TEEU industry rates for many sectors.  Production companies must, and do, adhere to the legislation that is in place to protect employees, as well as to the negotiated collective agreements.  This ensures that employees are provided with the best possible conditions while work is available.<\/p> <p>  The provision of training is essential and a priority to enable the industry to grow and develop new talent.  The provision of training is also a key deliverable under section 481.  The film industry is vibrant and has international accolades.  It reflects the quality of training and the trained crew Ireland has to offer.  While we do need a framework for national training, the reality is that most senior people in the film industry, for example heads of departments, started as trainees in the industry.<\/p> <p>  Screen Training Ireland is the national training and development agency for professionals working in the sector.  The agency is working well but requires additional resources and support to enable it to implement the recommendations of the Crowe Horwarth report.  One of the recommendations is a requirement to develop a national strategy for the screen industry to provide the strategic foundation for the ongoing development of policies and plans in respect of the audiovisual sector skills and the development of clear frameworks for the valuation and accreditation of training.  Screen Training Ireland, in its 2017 annual review, stated it will undertake a review of the report and seek to implement the major recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Screen Producers Ireland considers itself to be a leader in good employment policy and practice.  The #metoo and other campaigns brought the issue of sexual harassment into the spotlight.  These have empowered victims to speak up by providing a platform as millions of women around the world share their stories.  I am pleased to say that SPI and our members' approach to this issue has always been proactive.  In 2017 we collaborated with our industry partners, Screen Training Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, SIPTU, the Irish Film Board and others, including Equity, in providing a half-day workshop on dignity in the workplace, where we continued to communicate the absolute importance of a safe and respectful working environment and ensuring that individuals are protected in the workplace.  Following the workshop, SPI issued a suite of resources, including policy documents and promotional materials for display in offices and on sets.  We were also proud to partner with Amplify Women Collective when it published its excellent harassment and bullying practical toolkit.<\/p> <p>  The creative industries are one of Ireland's great strengths.<\/p><p>Irish-made productions are enjoyed by audiences around the world.  They enhance our reputation and provide high-value employment.<\/p><p> Individuals who work within this industry enjoy working in it because it is unique, creative and dynamic and provides the opportunity to work in a growing global industry.  Irish crew members are valued and highly skilled.  Their talents are visible on-screen and recognised by local and international awards.<\/p><p> To ensure the long-term sustainability and development of our sector, we require Government understanding of the cultural and economic value of the independent production sector.  It is vitally important that Ireland continues its long history of maintaining a tax incentive for production.  Without it, Ireland&rsquo;s production sector simply would not exist.  We call on the Government for an immediate commitment to extend the incentive in its current form beyond 2020.<\/p><p> I hope this very brief presentation gives the committee some helpful insights into the shape of the Irish film and TV drama sector and I will be happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Geraghty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir as an bhfianaise a thug siad inniu.

SIPTU was established in 1990 with the merger of the country&rsquo;s two largest unions, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and the Federated Workers Union of Ireland.  SIPTU currently represents more than 180,000 workers from virtually every category of employment across almost every sector of the Irish economy.  SIPTU provides the expertise, experience and back-up services necessary to assist workers in their dealings with employers, Government and industrial relations institutions.<\/p> <p>  The film and TV industry section of the union falls within the arts and culture sector of the services division of SIPTU.  SIPTU represents some construction grades, namely, stagehands and riggers while other unions, including the Building and Allied Trades' Union, BATU, and the Operative Plasterers and Allied Trades Society of Ireland, OPATSI represent the other grades in the construction area, namely, carpenters, plasterers and painters.  This group is formally known as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions construction group of unions and has the sole negotiating rights for the construction disciplines in the film and TV industry in the Republic of Ireland.  The Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, now known as CONNECT, also represents electricians in the industry.  SIPTU also holds the sole negotiating rights for the shooting crew grades.<\/p> <p>  I will now address working conditions and developments in the film industry, beginning with the topics of bullying and harassment.  The recent sexual harassment allegations in Ireland to date only relate to the theatre sector.  No evidence or allegations of sexual harassment have arisen from the film or TV sector in the Republic.  There is anecdotal evidence of a problem on the ground in the construction industry, but no specific complaints have been brought to the attention of the union for action.  The information to date suggests the possibility of an issue between workers rather than a structural problem.<\/p> <p>  Within the industry there is a genuine debate about continuity of employment for those workers who are categorised as employees when they are between jobs on film and TV productions.  The establishing of a special purpose vehicle, SPV, for each production means that a new company is formed every time a production is made, even when the primary production company is the same.  This creates a situation whereby the production company take no responsibility for workers after each production, even when there is little or no gap between productions.  It is a new, separate employment each time, so service does not accrue for the workers with any employer.  This is an unsatisfactory situation in any terms and the nature of the industry is not a plausible reason for this type of engagement.  The general construction industry operates in a similar project-to-project manner and has no issues with continuity of service.<\/p> <p>  In regard to employment status, there has been some general chatter about the widespread growth of what is referred to as \"bogus\" self-employment in the film and TV sector.  There has certainly been a rise in self-employment, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is bogus, as many workers involved in cameras, sound, and other disciplines insist they are choosing the self-employed route.  As a trade union, our preferred position is one of employment and not self-employment, which is why we view it as necessary to narrow the difference between these two types of employment.  To achieve this, we need to change the definition of persons to whom the employment legislation applies.  The legislation should refer to \"workers\", as is the case with the Industrial Relations Acts, and not \"employees\" as in many pieces of employment legislation.<\/p> <p>  On collective bargaining, pay and general working conditions are negotiated collectively between Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, and the ICTU construction group of unions for construction, and by SIPTU and SPI for the shooting crew grades.  We are currently making progress with SPI on an industry pension.<\/p> <p>  There is a definite gap in the industry when it comes to upskilling, training and development structures for the sector.  This has been a matter of discussion with Screen Training Ireland, SPI and SIPTU for some time.  It is our view that structures need to be agreed and implemented jointly to create sustainable and quality employment in the industry.  There are currently no controls on managing trainees in the industry and SIPTU suggests that a certified log book system be put in place for this purpose.  This would prevent trainees being abused by being kept as trainees for far too many years.  It also would ensure that all trainee roles are taken up by trainees, rather than by experienced people being used as cheap labour.  There must also be a structured development system for all grades so that there is room for progression.<\/p> <p>  With regard to stakeholder engagement, a film and TV sector stakeholder forum currently exists but it controlled by the Irish Film Board and is not utilised effectively.  We are therefore calling for the replacement of this forum with a jointly-led union and industry forum.<\/p> <p>  The continued funding of this industry is crucial to its growth and development.  However, there must be transparency and accountability for compliance with the funding terms, in particular where funding under section 481 is concerned.  In order to ensure value for taxpayers' money and to ensure that funding delivers quality and sustainable employment within the industry, we believe there should be annual published audits on compliance in respect of the numbers employed, numbers self-employed and the progression of trainees.<\/p> <p>  I hope this gives the committee a flavour of the current situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Macken"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":919,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  Obviously this is a very important sector for a number of reasons.  The first of these is the artistic expression it allows.  Second, it allows our country to tell our story.  To a certain extent, it is very easy for us to become a satellite of Anglo-American culture, and that is not a good thing.  Third, the sector adds a lot to the Irish economy.  Another important issue here, which is one of the issues on which we are focusing, is that so many individuals rely on the industry to survive for their bread and butter.  I believe that it is important that the State funds this sector but it is also important that the State analyses its funding to make sure it achieves the best output it can get.  Furthermore, because the State is funding the industry, it also has a special responsibility, a duty of care, to those who are working in the sector.<\/p> <p>  There undoubtedly are problems in the sector.  Anybody I have spoken to in the sector agrees on some of them.  The first problem I have noticed is the precarious nature of the employment.  As Mr. Macken has said, there is a debate concerning what is forced self-employment and what is chosen self-employment.  In my experience, in working conditions where there is even power between the worker and the employer, there is usually a better relationship between the two.  However, when the power is uneven it can sometimes lead to exploitation within a sector.<\/p> <p>  This industry seems to be structured so that much of the production happens by the use of special purpose vehicles.  They are designed for accounting purposes and to reflect international practice.  Those special purpose vehicles lead to short-term contracts, which lead to problems with continuity of contracts.  When continuity of contracts is lacking, workers can feel that they cannot access normal employee law or regulations.  There is the Workplace Relations Commission and employment legislation but if one's employment only lasts until the end of the month and one needs to stay in the good books until then in order that one can be employed on another special purpose vehicle, there is a danger that one will not access one's rights through that employment legislation.  There is a danger that if a person puts up his or her hand, he or she could be blackballed.  Such individuals could be seen as troublemakers.  In the experience of the three organisations represented here, is that a problem in the industry?  I ask the Irish Film Board to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#E00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":920,"content":"<p>The first challenge here is that the special purpose vehicles are specifically required as part of the section 481 tax incentive.

Special purpose vehicles for the making of feature films and TV drama series have been in place.  This is not something recent and it goes back 30, 40 and 50 years.  It has been standard practice for a long time not just in Ireland, but throughout the rest of the world.<\/p><p> There are two separate issues.  There are the employment arrangement issues on the one hand and the structures of the special purpose vehicle situation on the other.

I refer to the funding of the industry, how often productions are made and how long a time it takes to finance them.  We are not special children or a special case, but by its nature it is how the industry works.  There could be huge gaps.<\/p> <p>  There are also different genres of film and productions made by the same companies which require different skill sets.  I alluded to this earlier.  There could be a big build, a construction build and a period piece, a long running or short running one that requires a certain set of skills, yet something completely different.  In terms of moving from one production to another, it is driven by the genre, the skill set required and the number, because there are different types.

A person could work in the industry for 30 years and still have no form of security or continuity of employment and everything that comes with that.  No rights are built up and there are zero protections.  There is an easy answer to it.  There is an accepted wisdom in the industry that this is the way it is globally.  Many things were accepted globally as the right thing for a long time but they are no longer accepted practices now.<\/p> <p>  The nearest comparative industry to the film industry has to be the construction industry.  It goes from project to project and builders can be involved in several projects at the same time.  There can be overlap in all of those projects.  They do not have the same problem.  The construction industry in general, when building houses, hotels, schools or whatever, has long periods of employment and short periods of employment.  However, between those periods of employment, if the builder does not have another project, the employees are put on lay-off.  They can take up other work or not.  When the next project comes along, the builder recalls those people back to work.  If the break is not over six months long, then it is all reckonable service for employment purposes, if the committee understands what I mean by that.<\/p> <p>  There is a very easy answer to this.  The special purpose vehicle is the small vehicle but the production company is the main gig and it should be the main employer.  If I am the production company and I have a special purpose vehicle and I want a person in that as an employee for that time, there is no reason I cannot be the main employer.  The person is then put on that production.  I do not see that as rocket science.  The situation makes people incredibly vulnerable in the industry.  People have to be compliant and not complain about anything for the reasons mentioned.  Individuals cannot stand up for anything because disagreeing too strongly might mean he or she may not get the next gig.  I am not accusing anybody of doing that in this room.  I am saying it is a fact of life as the committee has identified.  Where there is a power imbalance and a person feels vulnerable, then he or she is more likely to be compliant in the way that he or she works rather than assert rights to good terms and conditions, etc.  I do not believe rocket science is needed to overcome this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Karan O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":928,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Collins have a comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#F00800","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Yes, from a slightly different perspective perhaps.

I not saying that is an excuse for employers to exploit mobility or flexibility, but in return for flexibility and mobility, individuals rise from trainee right up through the ranks to become a designer who will end up working not just in Ireland, but abroad developing their skills.

This is a major gripe within the sector as far as I can see because the training seems to have no beginning, no middle and no end.  It has no accreditation.  If a person looks to go into any sector, what he or she will seek is to know how long it is going to take, know what their output has to be and know the accreditation.  Once they have achieved that accreditation, he or she does not participate in that space again.  They move on.  However, that does not seem to be the case in the film industry.<\/p> <p>  Many people come to me and say they are being forced back into the same training spots repeatedly.

Would it be a good idea to initiate that forum and give workers in the industry a right to initiate that in the future?  Different sectors would have a right to initiate a forum.   Would it also be a good idea for the Irish Film Board to have a representative of the crew workers?  The Irish Board would then have a broader more insightful view into the experiences of the different people it takes to make a film.  I know that is not the Irish Film Board's choice.  It is the Minister's choice but it is something that could be suggested.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of films, what is the break down between indigenous films and international films funded in the State at the moment?

It is fantastic to see the mid-west region in production now.  They had two training course for set building and production trainees.  Five of the 19 production trainees are now gainfully employed on the production and nine of the 34 on the set building course are also working.<\/p> <p>  \"Vikings\" is being filmed in Ashford Studios, 40% of the official trainees were promoted, 50% were re-employed.  \"Into the Badlands\" is being shot in Ardmore Studios and 40% of the official trainees were promoted and 90% of the trainees were re-employed.  <\/p> <p>  I really think that not enough people know that we need to monitor and measure training.  I completely agree that we need a framework whereby training is structures and certified where appropriate and where possible, because that could look different for different grades.  There is lots of training happening and my biggest gripe is that people do not know about it and we are not able to capture what is happening.

I am here as Screen Training Ireland but I work in the Irish Film Board and am deputy chief executive officer.  A number of years ago when F&Aacute;S was being dissolved and being folded into the ETBs, with SOLAS being the policy body, F&Aacute;S came to us and asked whether we would take over the training element of the unit that had been sitting within F&Aacute;S.  We were very happy to do that.  That is a very small unit.  This is a major piece of work that needs to be done and this is a small unit of three people.  We structure our training across production and technical, which is the subject of what we are talking about today, business and enterprise and creativity and creative collaboration.<\/p> <p>  What we recognised when we got into Screen Training Ireland is that we really needed to move the agenda forward.  We started the process of commissioning a report to get a national conversation on where skills were going in the screen sector.<\/p> <p>  Screen Training Ireland also covers live action, film and TV drama, animation, games, visual effects, new emerging technologies in VR and it covers television broadcasts, so it is a very wide remit.  It is a far wider remit than the funding of the Film Board of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We finished the report last year and we published it in September.  I would say it took us longer to complete and when one has co-agencies it takes a while when they are on different slip streams.  Let me bring the members through a number of the ideas we are developing, which will be an active part of the work plan for the Irish Film Board in 2018.<\/p> <p>  In the booklet we published, we set out all the training we have been doing in 2017.  In 2017, the Irish Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, published the AV skills strategy report.  In 2018, Screen Training Ireland, STI will undertake a review of the report and seek to implement the major recommendations and these will include an advisory board for Screen Training Ireland, the appointment of a training manager, the engagement with the sector on the recommendations, a skills gap audit across live action, animation and television production sectors and consideration of accreditation models.  <\/p> <p>  In 2017 major advances were made in developing apprenticeships, however we recognise the scale of the work that still needs to be done in developing more work-based learning opportunities.  Many challenges still exist.  Diversity, inclusion, paths for new entrants and the ongoing issue of bridging the gap between third level and industry.  We also recognise that we need more hard data in terms of measuring the workforce.  Therefore in 2018, we will roll out an extensive careers portal in live action, animation and the effects in television production which will map careers in these areas.  We will launch that portal imminently.  We need to establish an industry education forum, carry out detailed research on the scale and the breakdown of the workforce; develop more traineeships and partnerships with SOLAS, the local education and training boards and third level; develop a trainee tool kit; and work closely with industry on partnership initiatives, especially around animation and increase mentoring, especially for female talent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#G01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa McGrane"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I would have had people come to me who have degrees, years of experience working in a particular sector within the industry who told me that they  get repeated requests to become part of a production as a trainee.  I do not know how that facilitates productions.  One of the important things is that we leave capacity in the sector.  If the Government is spending money there needs to be a capacity in the film industry that grows and grows.  Training is a great way to do that, but if we are saying to the same individuals that we want them to come back on to the next production as a trainee and they are coming to the end of their time as a trainee, with no piece of paper that is QQI accredited to say they have achieved that level, is that a weakness?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#G01500","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":946,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

I have watched the university system over 30 years and it grew into a place that one would go to university to learn how to make a film.  A person went to learn the sociology, the philosophy or the psychology of film or the brilliance of film and learn about the literature and writing of film, but to make a film takes an awful lot of ability.  Students came out from university thinking they were going to make films when they were nowhere near the concept of visualising a world for screen.  This is why I use the word \"apprenticeships\", which I say in the context of the glory of the great mosaics of years ago, great artists of the stained glass windows, writers and dramatists.  This is why I suggest that the Department of Education and Skills is looking for validation and QQI awards within that.  The Departments do not, however, communicate with each other here, which I have learnt as an innocent.  One nearly has to go in and say \"This is the route you could take and this is the conduit where people could have exactly that\".  They could continue to be trained until they become mentors or artists of the construction, as well as writers.  I hear the problem but having said that, the film industry in Ireland is a credit to all the representatives sitting before the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#J00400","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":982,"content":"<p>There is a lot covered there.  When we talk about parent companies, we must keep in mind that most production companies and producers are actually quite small.  There are a few that are very large.  It is rare but welcome that there are back-to-back series producers.  I have had family in the industry for years and years.  It is highly unusual that this happens but it is welcome that there are back-to-back series.  To put it in context, parent companies could be two or three-person operations and beyond the office, we must consider how training can take place.  It is also complex because there are different grades.  Reference was made to craft.  There are examples everywhere of people who started as runners in an art department and they worked their way through.  That is great but it requires a particular environment.  In respect of craft, I am all for measuring training, monitoring and certification of some kind and it only takes conversations around these tables to understand how this industry works.  We should not, however, be afraid of that.  Within the electricians in a crew, it is rare to see a trainee electrician on a production because they are all trained within the union and we are rarely given trainees.  With regard to apprenticeships, it is great if they work.  Screen Producers Ireland has supported a successful apprenticeship programme for the animation sector.  Another programme was unsuccessful.  Any solutions should be looked at but one should remember it is not that we are such a complex industry, it is just there are a lot of grades, a lot of crafts and training will look different from grade to grade and from skill set to skill set.  We need to get around a table and to find solutions.  These solutions will look different, in that workplace training will look different to training in between productions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Geraghty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":983,"content":"<p>I will confirm a point on apprenticeships and traineeships.

The amount of money a company gets from the State for that might amount to one third of the budget or perhaps slightly more than that.

If a person is working sporadically, it is possible to end up as a trainee for many years.  Sometimes, when work is scarce, it is hard for trainees to take up trainee positions because experienced people will be out of work and a production company will decide that it does not need another prop person but will offer qualified people the trainee position.  Qualified, experienced people end up working for trainee money.  It is a problem, and with the best will in the world, if we wait around for all of the reports to finish and then for another period for funding, the problem will never be dealt with.  Trainees need to be registered.  There needs to be a pool of trainees to run through the industry.  Collectively the industry needs to decide every year how many trainees it wants at the other end.

Ms O'Loughlin referenced a camera operator.  A director of photography hires the camera operator.  Let us say one had an in-house camera operator for a feature film.  The chances of the director of photography, who the funders want for their film, hiring the camera operator is probably very small.  Therefore, one would build up an overhead but have no work for that person and also tying up that person who then would not be free to earn money elsewhere.  I am not quite sure if the big building analogy is appropriate.  We should explore sustainability with SIPTU in a serious way.  In principle, the goal of sustainability is a really good one but we must parse and analyse the position regarding shooting crews.  I think the industry works on meritocracy.  If one is a good camera operator, one has no trouble getting work.  It is not about prejudice, it is about a creative choice that is made.  These people, at that level, can command sufficient funds that if they work for six months they can take six months off, if they so wish.  It is a lifestyle choice that is hard-earned and hard-won.  In the film industry there may be pockets of labour that would appreciate sustainability.  However, there may be other pockets of labour that would rise to the challenge of a meritocracy.  We need an industry that encompasses both of those objectives.

As Ms O'Loughlin indicated, there may be people at a very high and specific skill level who can pick and choose.  Let us call it what it is.  In the same way, a few A-list stars can pick and choose their movies.  However, that is not the situation for the majority of people, and it is them whom we must discuss.  I accept that there may be genuine breaks and so on, but I can see nothing from what has been described of the <i>status quo<\/i>that would prevent companies from deciding not to re-employ certain people because they did not like them.  Some of the witnesses may say that is not going on, it rarely goes on or whatever, but we have workers who are saying that it is going on.  It is not necessarily up to us to judge who is telling the truth, but there has to be a structure that prevents it from happening, links public funding to guarantees that it will not happen and ensures that there is enforcement and monitoring.  If money is going into the film industry through tax reliefs or whatever and certificates are being given to people about quality employment and so on, there has to be monitoring and enforcement.  We have to know that quality employment is being provided and that there is fairness in the treatment of the workers.<\/p><p>Obviously, there is a pool of workers in the industry.  Step 1 is that, after two, three or four years, a person is qualified, is in the pool and cannot be discriminated against within that pool on the arbitrary basis of someone liking or disliking him or her.  That last aspect is what we must prevent in order to achieve fairness.  People might respond to this comment, but we must reach that point.  It is only fair to those who work in the industry.<\/p><p>If there is this level of money going into the industry, and I would like to see more, there should be more permanent employment than is the case.  I get the point about not wanting to employ someone for six months doing nothing but, on the other hand, the level of permanent employment &ndash; we cannot even get a figure on it &ndash; seems to be low compared with the amount of Government money.  That needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>There is something called the working time directive, which, if I remember correctly, allows someone to work 39 hours plus a certain amount of overtime under EU law.  Is this being flagrantly disregarded in the film industry when it comes to many of the industry's workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#M02500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>One need only look at the results of the survey that Equity published at the end of 2016 regarding the issues of bullying and harassment to see that what the Deputy is referring to is true.<\/p><p>People are terrified of rocking the boat in any way, shape or form when they are in a precarious situation in work.

I am in a dilemma here, because sometimes the precarious nature of a job is its creativity.  Within the arts, people like to move, change or travel, to get different experiences, work with different directors or writers and so on.  That applies whether they are people doing hair or the main director.  The witnesses are right that precarious nature is sometimes taken for granted.  Nobody wants to consider the implications of this for an actor who is 50 or 60 years old and there are no more parts for him or her.  The same phenomenon of holding people in esteem exists in theatre.<\/p> <p>  This goes back to how we look at the arts and culture.  In politics, we are afraid even to say the words \"arts\", \"film\" \"dance\" or \"drama\".  We do not refer to them.  We include them in something else.  On the leaving certificate, there are 25 points for maths but not for music.  We will not say that we believe in this as a proper career where people could be precarious and permanent when necessary.  It is coming up here.  People want to be creative and imaginative.  They want to live in the world of the original, of beauty and that which is sacred and cultural.  It is hard for them to do it, whether they are construction workers, writers or actors because it is precarious.  Mr. Murray is right about the bullying, because it is free.  The wonderful words about the caged bird being free apply in the arts.  There are a lot of problems with that.<\/p> <p>  We have to get classrooms, universities and colleges out of our heads when we think of training in the arts, because mentorship plays a huge part in this.  I started as a radio actress, and I was around Daphne Carroll and Sean Ford.  I used to sit in the studio when I might have three lines on page 39 of the script and those actors were playing the main part.  I would sit in awe of these great actors with voices and experience, and that is when one begins to learn.  When I talk about training, I mean mentorship.  I mean exactly what the witnesses have said.  One does not have to go into a college and sit there, because that is not how it is done.  It is done with greats, be they photographic greats or director greats.  If I gave the wrong impression there, I just wanted to pull that back.  The witnesses' industry is wonderful and it does give great employment, but because it is creative, it does not have the boundaries into which we can nicely put other areas of employment.  Politics is very interesting because if they do not like us in politics, we will not come back the following day either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>We will finish on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00300","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>May I respond to Senator O'Donnell's point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karan O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Very quickly, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00500","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>It is important that we address the issue of precarity and the working time directive.

In regard to the working time directive, how it operates in the film industry needs to be understood.  The working time directive sets a maximum of 48 working hours in any week, but that is calculated as an average over 17 weeks.  Within the film industry, unless a person is in a long-running production, of which there are not many, the chances of working more than 17 weeks are slim.  A person could be within the parameters of the working time Act while working 55 or 60 hours a week for 10 or 12 weeks.  That is still within the parameters of the working time Act because it is averaged out over 17 weeks.  That is the law, that is the way it is written, and that is the way it is interpreted.  I am not saying it is right, but that is the way it is.<\/p> <p>  That 17 week rolling average can be expanded by agreement.  Agreements can be made to work out that average over a 12 month period.  That is done in other industries where work is cyclical, where people would work six months of the year, for example, picking mushrooms.  They would work intensively for a period of time and then stop.  The problem with the film industry and the working time directive is that if I work 60 hours a week for ten weeks on a production, that is not outside the working time directive.  If I move to another production straight away and work another 60 hours a week for another ten weeks, I am outside the working time directive in the hours I have worked over the 20 weeks, but each of those production companies, considered separately, is not.  That is a problem.  That is the way the legislation is written.  The Government would need to address that in some way to make the industry more compatible with the law.  That is the factually correct answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Karan O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>We will finish on that.

The NDA was established to provide independent and evidence-informed advice for the Minister on matters of policy and practice relevant to the lives of people with disabilities.  We were given additional functions to operate the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design from 2007.  Our role means that we cover a very wide range of policy areas, Departments and public sector remits.  The statutory Centre for Excellence in Universal Design promotes the universal design of the built environment, products, services and information and communications technology in order that they can be accessed, understood and used independently to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their age, size, ability or disability.  The NDA&rsquo;s view is that a universal design approach to transport would benefit everyone, particularly those with disabilities and older people, especially as it could maximise their participation in society and control over their own lives.<\/p> <p>  Since the NDA was established, transport has been one of the key priority areas identified for attention and focus in our work, with other areas such as employment, for example.  In particular, we have consistently advised that an integrated, planned approach would be required to successfully implement universal access to transport for all.  This would entail joined-up working, involving the different Departments, related agencies and stakeholders working together to provide a co-ordinated policy approach that worked nationally and at local level.  The focus is on the customer&rsquo;s end to end journey.  It requires mainstream policies and services that have been designed to include the needs of persons with disabilities and that have been disability-proofed in line with the Government's commitment to disability mainstreaming.  Our advice is informed by research, learning from good practice and the experiences and views of people with disabilities which we capture in surveys, studies and our consultation exercises.  <\/p> <p>  The NDA has also advised on the broader policy areas of which transport is part which include the built environment, education, employment, health and disability supports.  We advise that there be a focus on accessible transport actions in the strategic plans of Departments and agencies, as well as national strategies and programmes, for example, the current national disability inclusion strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  The NDA produced a code of practice on the accessibility of public services and information.  It has also produced a range of free guidance materials on how to achieve integrated universally designed services.  It has held various seminars and workshops on transport issues that have facilitated discussion and shared learning on how transport services can be more integrated and universally designed for all.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the developments advanced by the Department, the NTA and various agencies and the commitment to continued progress in their strategic plans and national strategies.  The positive developments include increased investment and established plans to address inaccessible transport; an expanded fleet of accessible buses, with a figure of 100% reached in some areas; work being advanced by the NTA to source accessible buses and coaches to address existing challenges for passengers with disabilities; increased investment and an increase in the number of wheelchair accessible vans, WAVs, in the taxi fleet and efforts to continue to expand; rural transport programme developments to support connection with transport solutions; work on a community car scheme to bring customers to transport service locations; continuing work to address the issue of advance notice requirements for services, including rail, even though we appreciate further work is required to address issues in that regard; the roll-out of audiovisual announcements; the development of information solutions for customers; the operation of user groups by transport service providers which should assist in identifying practical solutions to accessibility issues on the ground; and the roll-out of disability awareness training for staff.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, despite positive developments, there are still many people with disabilities who are experiencing barriers in accessing transport.  This needs to be seen as a quality customer service issue rather than as an add-on solution to the problem of disability access.  That entails applying the principles of universal design.  The issues that still need to be addressed include but are not limited to the fact that accessible taxis are not readily available, even in cities where numbers have increased.  Even where accessibility has been advanced, it can break down, unless it is maintained and resourced by trained staff.  Challenges remain in accessing information, as not everyone has a smartphone.  Data systems for each service need to be consistent and inter-operable.<\/p> <p>  Health and safety need to be key considerations.  There is little or no support at stations or on trains, particularly where emergency evacuation is required.  The requirement for advance notice limits people with disabilities in their right to get around.  There are issues with any notice period exceeding 36 hours with reference to EU regulations for coaches.  The reasons there is a need to give notice in advance in some cases we understand arise from technical challenges.  We are pleased that the NTA is working to identify some solutions in that regard.<\/p> <p>  It is crucial that all staff across all public transport services are trained to build awareness and competence.  It should be easier for persons with disabilities to communicate with service providers and easily access complaints procedures.  We note the work to be advanced at bus stops throughout the country.  Some private bus and taxi operators are not providing the same level of accessible transport as their public transport service counterparts.  While audiovisual announcements have improved, they need to be available in all areas.  There is a need for a more robust system to measure and track how accessible public transport services are operating on the ground.<\/p><p>There are safety issues for transport that are also relevant for pedestrians and cyclists, such as challenges navigating Luas tracks.  There is a need for an integrated and accessible ticketing system across services and systems and there are issues concerning the availability of transport for those in disability services.  We welcome the work by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to look at that along with engaging with the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p><p> A key issue is the fact that transport supports are operated by and come within the policies of various Departments and agencies.  There is a need for a more joined-up policy approach to achieve integrated transport services.<\/p><p> The National Disability Authority, NDA, will continue to provide advice to the Department, the NTA and other Departments on the various issues that need to be addressed to ensure the development and operation of an integrated, universally designed public transport service that is responsive to the needs of its customers, including people with disabilities.<\/p><p> We advise cross-departmental working in order to develop a national transport strategy that details how the different Departments and related agencies will work together to deliver an effective, universally designed, integrated public transport service.  We advise the continued and full implementation of actions already committed to in national strategies and that further actions be committed and set out in those strategies which are, in effect, living documents whose implementation is regularly monitored.  It is important that there is buy-in and accountability for those actions throughout the Departments, agencies and service providing bodies within mainstream policy and services and that a universal design approach is adopted, as well as ensuring adherence to new and existing European directives and legislation on accessibility.<\/p><p> The NDA is advancing work to monitor the accessibility of transport services further to research we conducted and a pilot we engaged in recently with the Department, the NTA, service providers and disability stakeholders.  The intention of that project was to identify mechanisms for robust data and a rounded picture on what is happening in services.  We will commence the next stage in monitoring specific transport services this year.  Transport needs to be viewed as a service from the widest perspective, recognising the newer transport solutions emerging, for example, GoCar, and considering how these will be factored into an integrated, universally designed transport service that serves everybody in society and does not reduce mobility for some.  The NDA welcomes the possibility of continued exploration in that regard, being led by the NTA, to identify practical solutions to some of the challenging access issues regarding the overall transport system.  We will continue to play our part in supporting progress through research, advice and guidance.<\/p><p> The NDA considers that accessible transport is key to ensuring equal participation for people with disabilities.  The NDA acknowledges many positive developments but the reality is that many people with disabilities still face barriers on a daily basis.  The NDA recommends that the committed actions detailed in this presentation need to be implemented and, in particular, the action on all key agencies working together to deliver an integrated, universally designed transport system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Barron for a comprehensive and constructive analysis.

The remit of the NTA is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State to encourage the development and implementation of an integrated accessible transport system within the greater Dublin area and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  This includes the assignment to the authority of the management of the public transport accessibility investment programme.<\/p> <p>  In terms of accessibility of public transport services, they are largely determined by when particular services or infrastructure came into existence.  Accordingly, older public transport infrastructure is largely not accessible or has limited accessibility features. However, more recent infrastructure is designed and built with the needs of disabled users in mind.  The NTA is actively committed to ensuring that new public transport services and infrastructure are fully accessible.  We are committed to securing the retrofitting of all older public transport infrastructure as quickly as resources will allow.<\/p> <p>  As for the current public transport infrastructure, the city bus fleet is now 100% low floor wheelchair accessible and will be maintained so by means of the infrastructure investment programme, with boarding arrangements, seating and internal layout addressing the needs of all passengers.  The fleet purchased in recent years in Dublin has a wheelchair space, as well as a buggy space.  The difficulty on some city services is the availability of the wheelchair space.  The NTA is supporting a multi-agency initiative, launched in October 2017, of a new awareness campaign which highlights the importance of the dedicated wheelchair zone on every Dublin Bus.  The initiative aims to demonstrate the negative consequences that can affect a wheelchair user if they are unable to access the wheelchair zone on Dublin Bus services and encourages commuters to leave the wheelchair zone vacant for those who need it most.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the regional bus fleet, regional bus services are primarily delivered by single-deck or double-deck coaches.  The double-deck coaches are accessible by ramp but require the removal of seats to provide the wheelchair space and the required restraint.  The remaining coach fleet that is accessible uses an external wheelchair lift to lift the passenger onto the high floor of the coach.  Approximately 86% of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s coach fleet is wheelchair accessible.  That percentage will increase as the coach fleet is replaced.  As this fleet requires the removal of seats, 24-hour notice of travel is required.  With regard to bus stops, all city bus stops are fully accessible as they can be served by wheelchair ramp and kneeling suspension on buses.  In regional cities they are wheelchair accessible where there is a hard standing at the stop.  A bus stop that can facilitate the operation of a wheelchair lift from a high-floor coach requires a minimum of 3 m space to the back of the footpath.  Currently, very few bus stops that receive coach services have this space.<\/p> <p>  A number of bus stations are currently accessible but more work is required on some of the key bus stations.  Real-time arrival information is available for each stop on bus and rail services on the web, the smart phone app and SMS messaging service.  Currently, visual and audible next stop announcements are not available on all bus services other than Dublin Bus services.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 10% of public transport services are delivered by commercial operators licensed by the NTA.  In the annual returns we have received from those operators for 2016 services, 16% of the services had low-floor wheelchair accessible vehicles while a further 28% had vehicles with lifts suitable for wheelchair access.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rural transport programme, those services are operated and managed by the NTA and the 17 LocalLink offices and are largely wheelchair accessible.  LocalLink now provides demand-responsive services under the rural transport programme, which provides a high level of support to the public.  These are door-to-door services that are suitable for those who have a disability and may also have passenger assistance on board.  The NTA has invested in improving the wheelchair lifts on the fleet owned by the rural transport companies.  The current services are being retendered in 2017 and 2018 with a provision that all services must be fully wheelchair-accessible within two years of contract award.<\/p> <p>  All the Luas services have been designed to be fully accessible.<\/p> <p>  As for heavy rail services, all of the fleet operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is fully accessible internally.  The main issue with accessibility for wheelchairs is that a ramp is required between the platform and the carriage and not all rail stations are accessible.  Accordingly, 24 hours' notice of travel must be given currently to ensure access for wheelchair users on all rail services.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has recently introduced a pilot scheme, which results in the notice being reduced to four hours, and a review will be undertaken following the pilot to see how it was received by customers.<\/p> <p>  Of the 144 stations on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network, 118 have received accessibility upgrades or were constructed new to full accessibility standards such that all platforms are accessible, with the remaining 26 stations having one platform accessible.<\/p> <p>  An accessibility audit carried out in 2014 identified 54 stations across the network that require accessibility enhancements.  Since 2015, a number of stations had accessibility enhancement works completed, including Kilcock, Enfield and Maynooth.  Improvements include signage, new footpaths and elimination of steps.  Further works commenced in 2017 on a number of other stations.<\/p> <p>  Installation of a fully accessible lift and associated works at platform 6-7 in Connolly Station, which was identified as one of the major accessibility issues on the rail network, were completed in 2016 and the lift has been fully operational since then.<\/p> <p>  Next stop announcements, both visual and audible, are available on all intercity and commuter rail services.  However, the next stop announcements on the DART service is not up to the required standard and needs replacement.<\/p> <p>  The National Transport Authority continues to support the travel assistance scheme, which is managed by Dublin Bus.<\/p><p>The scheme aims to give people with disabilities confidence to use public transport.  Under the scheme, an assistant can accompany people who need help using public transport and to plan a journey on Dublin Bus, Luas and DART.  Over 1,000 individuals availed of the scheme in 2016 and a total of &euro;200,000 was allocated to the scheme in 2017.<br\/><br\/>The availability of a wheelchair-accessible taxi fleet has been falling in line with the decline in numbers of licensed vehicles and licensed drivers in the industry.  A number of measures have been introduced to increase the number of wheelchair accessible vehicles in the fleet.  Since 2010, the only new vehicle licences issued are for wheelchair-accessible vehicles; new regulations were introduced in 2014 to allow smaller and less-expensive wheelchair-accessible vehicles to operate as taxis and hackneys; and a grant system for wheelchair-accessible vehicles was put in place offering grants of up to &euro;10,000 for the purchase of or conversion to a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, WAV.  The WAV grant scheme has operated from 2014 and the success of the grant scheme is demonstrated by an increase in the number of WAVs in the small public service vehicle fleet from 860 in June 2014 to 1,555 in December 2017, which now represents 7.6% of the total fleet.  One of the conditions attaching to the scheme is that all recipients of the grant must successfully complete a disability awareness training programme, which is provided free of charge by the Irish Wheelchair Association on behalf of the NTA.  There are strict terms and conditions attaching to the WAV grant scheme to ensure that accessible vehicles are used for the intended purpose.  Disability awareness training is provided by all transport operators and disability user groups have been established by all public transport providers.  An accessibility officer has also been appointed across all operators.<br\/><br\/>As that is the current status, what needs to be done?<b><font color=\"#4181C0\"> <\/font><\/b>The funding available in recent years has been considerably constrained, which resulted in difficult choices and prioritisation of projects.  However, the four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost &euro;28 million for the accessibility retrofit programme for the period 2018 to 2021.  This funding is a trebling of the previous allocation for accessibility under the capital plan.  This will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, the upgrading of train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and the grant scheme to support the introduction of more wheelchair-accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet and many of the projects I intend to outline.<br\/><br\/>As for the bus fleet, the high-floor coaches currently available do not offer a good customer experience to wheelchair users.  There does not seem to be many alternatives to this type of fleet for long distance inter-urban services.  Together with Bus &Eacute;ireann, we propose a change in our fleet strategy for shorter regional commuter services of less than 50 km.  In future, these services could be operated by low-floor single-deck vehicles, rather than high-floor coaches.  We are in the process of procuring the first of these vehicles with a low-floor ramp entry suitable for the mobility impaired with a dedicated wheelchair space and we expect them to be in service from 2019.  With regard to commercial public transport services, now that the NTA has more knowledge of the fleet available to the Irish market,<b><font color=\"#424282\"><\/font><\/b>the authority will move to regulate the accessibility of the public transport services operated by commercial operators.  The authority will publish its proposals in this area later this year, which will set out minimum accessibility standards for fleets operating public transport services for new licences and on renewal of existing licences.<br\/><br\/>The authority is looking at ways to improve the journey information available to disabled users.  The national journey planner features a wheelchair symbol for transport services that are known to be accessible.  The authority is also looking into providing information on options for a step-free journey on the journey planner.  This requires an audit of bus stops and other public transport infrastructure to determine their level of accessibility and this work is under way.  The authority is in the process of standardising names of stops, which will be disseminated across all bus services.  This will allow next-stop announcements to be made where the facility is available on the bus.  Retrofitting of visual screens will be undertaken as required for the visual next-stop announcements.<br\/><br\/>In 2013, a comprehensive estimate of the cost of addressing accessibility issues at the various Bus &Eacute;ireann bus stations was prepared.  Excluding three particular stations - Bus&aacute;ras, Ceannt Station, Galway and Colbert Station, Limerick - the cost of addressing accessibility issues at the other bus stations was estimated at &euro;11.5 million.  Separate larger redevelopment plans have been prepared for Colbert Station, Limerick and Ceannt Station, Galway, both of which are shared bus and rail stations and these will include compliance with all accessibility standards as part of those redevelopments.  The authority will work with Bus &Eacute;ireann and CI&Eacute; to ensure that a comprehensive programme of upgrading bus stations continues.  Access to railway station buildings and platforms remains challenging at some locations.  The authority will continue to fund accessibility upgrades at stations as funding allows.<br\/><br\/>With respect to bus stops for high-floor coach services, as I indicated, the wheelchair arrangements for high-floor vehicles require a large area of adjacent footpath to operate, typically between 3 m and 3.5 m in width.  In many towns and villages, it is extremely challenging to achieve the necessary footpath width for the vehicle lift to function.  Solutions such as relocating the bus stop to an alternative location may be necessary but this can give rise to additional problems, in that the alternative stop location may not suit other users.  In other cases land or property acquisition may be required to obtain the necessary space, potentially requiring the exercise of compulsory acquisition powers to acquire the relevant lands.  As a result of the complexity of determining the solution in each case and the need for extensive consultation with various parties, we do not have a singular figure for making all coach stops capable of accommodating wheelchair lifts on coaches.  However, we will continue to upgrade the bus stops, where possible, to ensure that all main towns have at least one wheelchair lift-accessible bus stop in each direction.<br\/><br\/>With regard to taxis and hackneys, the NTA will continue to offer a WAV grant as long as funding is available to achieve a minimum of 10% of WAVs in the fleet by 2020.  The DART fleet requires an upgrade of its next-stop announcements.  In general, the communications to passengers on board the trains and particularly in stations needs to be improved.  An upgrade of the on-board and at-station communications systems is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;30 million.  Work will commence shortly on scoping this project.<br\/><br\/>The authority is looking at the legislative changes required to allow the operators' by-laws to be changed to allow enforcement of priority for wheelchair users.  Whereas much has been done to raise the level of accessibility across our public transport services, I acknowledge there is still work to do.  Some of that work is challenging but the NTA is committed to meeting that challenge in partnership with our operating companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham for that comprehensive address to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#F00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>I thank both groups for their informative submissions.

It is a policy advisory body but we do have functions and roles in monitoring programmes.  We do not have powers of enforcement or inspection.  We monitor compliance with accessibility requirements by all public sector bodies and Departments.  We are also monitored.  We have a code of practice on accessible public services and information.  We consider the transport service in that context.  As part of that we are researching a monitoring mechanism to roll out the focus for a detailed analysis of what is happening in the transport area.  We started that with research on the kind of tools and mechanisms that would be effective for measuring accessibility.  Other jurisdictions struggle with how to ensure strong, clear, concrete standards to measure accessibility.  There is very poor quality data, and differing data from service providers.  We considered trialling a system and self-assessment questionnaires, we did mystery shopping and customer satisfaction surveys and we analysed performance measurement systems.<\/p> <p>  We worked very closely with the NTA, the Department and the public service providers and disability stakeholders to try to devise something that would be workable and would give the quality information required.  We intend to roll that out later this year.  There will be roles for us and for the NTA in monitoring that transport.  The NTA has responsibility for receiving quarterly performance reports from public service providers.  There is potential to focus on accessibility within that and we would work to give guidance on how that might be measured and reported consistently.  In addition, we would consider the areas of the roles of access officers in transport services, monitoring how that is working on the ground, the accessible information.  We would produce an independent assessment and report for the Minister on that with recommendations on what needs to be addressed.

There is no budget set aside specifically for disability services because the challenge is to make all the public transport services fully accessible.  Our regional cities are very much there.  Some aspects need to be improved such as next stop announcements and screens but overall the level of accessibility in the cities is quite high.  The challenge is outside the cities and we have an issue with the fleet and bus stop infrastructure and information.  There is a very low level of accessibility outside the city areas.<\/p> <p>  We receive a separate budget of &euro;28 million for the next four years from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the disability programme to improve and retrofit the infrastructure.  That will go into the type of works I indicated earlier.  I could not give a timeframe for getting all our services 100% accessible.  It depends on the level of funding available, on some changes we hope to see in the fleet, and working together with our agencies and operators to deliver the infrastructure on the ground.  There are definitely challenges in all that and I would not be able to give a timeframe.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked about the bus fleet.  Before now all the services outside Dublin were operated by a coach fleet, which is a high floor coach.  We have moved and changed our strategy so that the shorter journeys outside our cities will be operated by low floor vehicles, with a dedicated wheelchair space.  That is a change in approach to the fleet.  There would be no requirement for notice in respect of the fleet but we have to make sure there are accessible bus stops to serve that type of fleet.  The challenge is the inter-city, the longer journey fleet which usually operates with a higher floor because that level of comfort is needed for the long distance journeys.  We want to move away from the 24-hour notice.  We would like to have no notice period associated with public transport services.  We are moving incrementally by considering the short journeys initially, removing the requirement for notice on the basis that we have a low floor fleet available with the right bus stop infrastructure.  <\/p> <p>  We are undertaking the audit of bus stops.  We had done a lower level audit.  Using much of the framework from the NTA we are assessing those in much more detail to see what level of accessibility we can give to the infrastructure we have.  That will identify the work that needs to be done to have them considered 100% accessible, which feeds into the information we give on the journeys that can be made, through our journey planner.  That work is under way and we expect to complete it in the next few months, which will also help our work programme on bus stops in particular.<\/p><p> The information that I gave on the private operators - the licensed commercial operators - refers to the services that are operated privately.  That is the public transport services that are licensed by us, not tendered by us.  When we go to tender services, and we do use commercial operators to provide services for us, we have moved and are moving towards requiring that the fleet they operate is wheelchair accessible, and preferably low-floor wheelchair accessible, particularly for the shorter journeys.  <\/p><p> In terms of rural transport services, we allowed a short lead-in term of two years for those services.  That means if the service is not wheelchair accessible, now that we have awarded them the contract, they have two years to get their fleet in place to offer wheelchair access.  If they do not comply then we re-tender the service and remove the service from them.  We are moving slowing to improve and move as much as possible towards a low-floor accessible fleet that does not require notice, and that does not require the removal of seats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>I would like a clarification.

I am concerned about the suggestion that there should be buy-in by various Departments.  I wish to make the point that they should automatically do so.<\/p> <p>  I want to refer to wheelchair accessible taxis.  I received a reply from the National Transport Authority in the past few weeks.  I accept that there is a grant scheme.  The grant and the changes made in 2014 have been helpful.  The number of such taxis per head of population varies very significantly.  For example, Tipperary is the worst with just one wheelchair accessible taxi for every 28,000 people.  By contrast, Dublin has one wheelchair accessible taxi for every 2,000 people.<\/p> <p>  In terms of growing the fleet by 10%, it matters where the 10% is located because disability is not something that is unique to one location.  Has a more targeted approach been proposed for areas where very significant deficiencies in the service has shown up?  How can one ensure there is a universal spread in terms of a service if one does not implement a targeted approach, as well as grow the number?  I presume the 10% is a target.  It would be nice if that target was exceeded. <\/p> <p>  I would like to hear more about the measurement of outcomes.  If one does not have a plan there will be no outcomes and one cannot see if progress has been made.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Graham mentioned that providers are given two years to move towards providing an accessible service.  Are there situations where there is an accessible service but when the NTA moved to a tender process the service disimproved only to improve again in two years' time?  Would that be something the NTA would not permit?  We do not want the service to go backwards and forwards.  If there is a fully accessible fleet then there should be a comparable competitive tender.  I mean the competitive tender should be like with like.<\/p><p>Could the witness give an indication of the costs for retrofitting older public transport or if any work has been done on that?  It would be useful for us to have that in our report.  For example, is it possible to retrofit the rail services with automatic ramps?  With regard to bus stops, does the National Transport Authority have a plan and then require the local authorities, if the local authorities are involved at all, to implement the plan?  How is that carried out?  What we do not want is a very enthusiastic local authority using all the money and it not being in the worst part of the country.  It should have a reasonable spread.  There is a &euro;30 million scoping project relating to DART for the announcements and the visual upgrades.  Is there a timeline for it being implemented?  Does it all have to be implemented at the same time or does Ms Graham have information on that?<\/p><p> Ms Graham referred to compulsory acquisition powers with regard to bus stops.  How advanced is the authority on being clear about what it is seeking, and is there buy-in from the Department to include that in legislation?  Where is the engagement on that?  In terms of the legislative changes regarding the use of the section on the bus, what is the position with that?  When might we see that appearing in either primary or secondary legislation, if that is necessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#H01900","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for giving me the opportunity to speak.  He is under pressure too.  I was a member of the board of the National Disability Authority for a number of years.  We received welcome news from the Government yesterday on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I draw people's attention to Article 9 on accessibility to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, including information and communication technologies, and so forth.  It refers to both urban and rural.  The rural conundrum has been mentioned already.  We will ratify the convention in a month or two.  I believe the work the committee has been doing already in the space around accessibility puts one in a good place to drive and keep that theme.  We have had meetings with people with disabilities as witnesses and participants.  It gives an edge to the proceedings.  It is a different environment from the one we are in today, but we are all committed to the same thing.  Getting things moved forward means nothing to somebody with a disability who cannot depend on a service today.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ms Barron's presentation, it is unfair but I will try to distil it down to where we are and what needs to happen.  She made a few key statements.  She referred to the various Departments and agencies involved.  This theme is in the remit of the National Transport Authority as well.  She said the NDA advises cross-departmental working and she referred to the importance of getting full implementation of all the actions already agreed.  There is a gap between action and moving it to execution.  How big a boost would it be to this project if the various Departments and entities, and this encompasses local authorities, transport, private operators and others, were to work together in a more coherent and determined way?  With ratification of the convention approaching, getting folk together in a determined way across the different silos in which they normally work would be important.  Transport accessibility is key to a range of other things.  We do not need to labour that other than to mention training, employment and other services.  Does she have a view on that?<\/p> <p>  Due to the time constraints I will move to Ms Graham's presentation.  I thank her for it and for the work the authority is doing.  She said when replying to a question that we have a low level of accessibility outside the cities.  It is helpful to say that in simple language.  That is the case not just for people with disabilities but also for older people and people who live outside the big cities.  We should remember that.  Giving 24 hours notice does not mean that it works.  Two of the five wheelchair users who turned up for the pilot presentation about the four hour scheme for the DART on Monday could not get there or could not get home.<\/p> <p>  There is another question.  It is not a tricky question but it is not a two plus two equals four question.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked how long more it will take and Ms Graham said that depends on how much comes out of the State's pocket.  Ms Graham might not be able to answer this question but it would be useful if she could advise the committee on it.  Given the trend that has been in place over the last number of years and the amount of money that has been available to deal with the accessibility project, how long would it take if that was the continuing trend?  She might have footnotes to that because she might say there is an indication that it will be improved or whatever, but taking the baseline that we keep going at the current level, in what year and century will this be sorted?  That would be useful for us.<\/p> <p>  I have a similar question for the NTA to the one I put to the NDA.  The NTA has a remit to develop the provision of integrated public transport services and integrated accessible transport systems within the Dublin area.  What are the different stakeholders that have to be involved, such as local authorities and so forth?  Again, could we pump up the work by the different agencies?  I have a range of other questions but I will not ask them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#J00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will thank you for not asking them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#J00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>We can return to them.

For me and all members of the committee this is one of the most important, if not the most important, pieces of work to which we can contribute.  Our guests' contribution is very important for us.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make some fundamental points.  First, I tried to imagine myself in a wheelchair.  Can people try to do that?  I live in Connemara.  It is not a matter of me simply sitting into the car, driving to Dublin, going to meetings, staying in a hotel and so forth.  I am not able to imagine it.  I do not thing any of us can put ourselves in that situation.  It is not anybody's intention but I believe we are treating part of our community as second class citizens.  We should start from there.<\/p> <p>  I have a little involvement in this area.<\/p><p>I am a patron of Ability West and the Irish Association of Supported Employment, IASE.  The term \"disability\" does not sit right with me because I know several people to whom it is applied who have significantly more ability than I and many others do.  They are incredibly talented individuals with many abilities.  If we accept that as a framework and try to put ourselves into the shoes of such people, we might be able to begin to imagine some of the challenges they face.<\/p><p> What the committee is trying to do in this regard is probably the most important thing it might achieve and it needs a clear structure, strategy and key performance indicators, KPIs.  What are the witnesses' organisations hoping to achieve?  I am very respectful of them and appreciate that they are doing their best.  What are they trying to achieve, by what time, how much will it cost and what are the challenges?  I found the presentations very useful and perhaps they had to be somewhat general.  Towards the end of her presentation, Ms Graham began to get more specific, which I appreciate.  Perhaps it is because I come from a business background but I wish to know what is to be done, when, by whom and what the key deliverables and challenges are.  If those facts are available for the committee to study, interrogate in a positive way and begin using in our deliberations it will give significant meat to what we are trying to achieve.  We need the witnesses' help in that regard.<\/p><p> The issue regarding urban and rural as raised by other members is very important.  We must do our best to have balance.  Imagine if one were trying to go from A to B and had to give 24 hours' notice before travelling.  It would not be easy.  I appreciate that the witnesses are doing their best.  This issue must be pushed as a very high priority.  It is very important to have KPIs and a business plan and to know what is to be delivered, when, by whom, how much it will cost and what the challenges are.  I would value the witnesses' comments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#J00500","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>I was in Cuba a few years ago and everybody had to give 24 hours' notice to use public transport.

Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh fairly summed the issue up a moment ago.  At our first meeting on this issue, witnesses with limited mobility appeared before the committee to share their experiences of using public transport.  Those experiences were less than flattering in some cases, although some positive experiences were also shared.  However, the positive experiences shared were the result of the goodwill of key people working on behalf of the transport companies.  That should not be the case.  It should not be about who one meets when one turns up at a DART, train or bus station.<\/p> <p>  We must set key targets for what we want to achieve, by when and how that will be done.  Without knowing exactly where one wants to go and the timeframe for getting there, one is unable to put a plan in place.  The reduction to four hours of the notice required for usage of the DART by persons with limited mobility has recently been rolled out.  Although a reduction from 24 to four hours' notice would normally be welcome, the service users were far from complimentary of the measure.  We need to accelerate our efforts to ensure we make public transport accessible for all.

On an advocate for change, many people come to me with issues relating to disability and I often think there is an absence of an advocate to carry the flag for them.  Do we need a better advocacy service?  Do we need more transparency regarding people who are refused or cannot get to transport?  The more information that can be put in the public domain in respect of that matter without compromising people's personal details, the better.

On outcomes and outcome indicators, a large part of our role in the National Disability Authority is to measure the outcomes and impacts of policies as well as their outputs.  Strategies such as the national disability strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy factor in specific timeframes, targets and responsibilities.  They are sometimes a little loose in terms of an exact timeframe and an activity may be described as ongoing but even in such a case we measure it against what is happening.  The National Disability Authority produces an assessment report, usually on an annual basis, for the relevant monitoring committees for the national disability strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy.  We recently submitted an analysis to the latter committee.  That is one form of analysis but it can tend to measure outputs.<\/p> <p>  Overall outcomes involve measuring the difference an action has made in the lives of those with disabilities.  One can provide more accessible buses on a route but if people do not use them to travel, it does not make much of a difference in their lives.  Our role is also to consider how that can be monitored at the higher level of outcomes.  We often have to rely on data reported overall from the Central Statistics Office because such data is robust and collected at frequent intervals, which means it can be measured over a period of time.  However, that can also impact the frequency at which one can measure such outcomes.<\/p> <p>  Along with the HSE, we have devised a monitoring framework specific to disability services and the supports in that regard.  It is built on an area of nine outcomes and the impact on people's lives in terms of living in the community, friendships, being able to get out and about and how one measures that at a personal level as well as overall.  That is a work in progress in terms of how it will be implemented and transport will be a key aspect thereof.<\/p> <p>  There is a challenge in terms of the quality of data when measuring outcomes at the highest level because people measure and report different things.  Different organisations are measuring apples and oranges.  One is very reliant on a very good data source, which is dependent on the questions asked, what is recorded and how the information is categorised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Barron"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>It would be useful to know, in the context of the committee's report, whether there is a way to get a similarity in approach such that people are talking about the same things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#K00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>There is such a way in regard to transport.  One of the issues we considered as part of monitoring the transport service was looking at getting information from a range of sources but founded on very clear criteria.  We will be working with the National Transport Authority on devising those criteria for measuring accessibility.  That information will also come from how complaints are recorded.  There was mention of transparency, which will help identify issues and the number of incidents.  There is no reason for service providers not to undertake regular customer surveys because customer service is the issue for everybody, including those with disabilities.<\/p><p>The findings on that could be published and could inform further improvements.  There is further work to be done in the context of indicators.  In looking internationally at what might constitute effective measurement tools, it is something that is quite challenging.  We are working with DIT and engaging with Trinity College in respect of data analytics and good systems for improving that.  We are continuing to bring that to bear in terms of monitoring transport and other policy areas.  I hope that is okay.<\/p><p> I will now address the questions from Senator Dolan regarding what needed to happen overall in terms of getting bodies to work together.  One of the challenges is that there are lots of good initiatives but they are happening in isolation.  They are being funded by different Departments and agencies.  They are not connected.  There is an issue around someone's journey from A to B.  People may have to use different transport means.  They need lots of information about that, reliability of timetables and certainty that there will be a connection between that and that they can easily access it in a most convenient way.  It is not just about getting out to a social life.  It is obviously critical to employment, education and other things people want to do.  While we welcome the fact that transport is a core element of strategies like the comprehensive employment strategy and the national disability strategy, there is a need to look at transport in the round in the context of all those different Departments and how that all joins up and works together, how funding can be more effectively used and how those services can be better linked.<\/p><p> Going back to the question about outcome indicators, there are lots of data.  It is a matter of bringing all of that together and using it to better effect.  Bringing all of that together and capturing it in some kind of overall strategy with timeframes and indicators would lend itself to measuring this more easily over time but, in particular, to measuring our report to the UN committee in terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and how we are advancing the issues relating to that.  Many of those issues are captured in the national disability strategy and other frameworks to a degree but a lot more can be done to achieve a joined-up approach across agencies and in respect of sharing of data.  There is the question of rural-urban issues, the taxi service and the standards that can apply.  It also means that they would all be measured in the same way as well.  We feel there is a need to bring Departments and agencies together to create some kind of transport for all plan and looking at it from a universal design approach so it is not, as I said earlier, about an add-on service.  It is about a service for everybody, including people with disabilities, and a good customer service from which everybody benefits.<\/p><p> I think a lot of the points were made equally about clear structures and strategies and indicators, which would be part of that; a better way of monitoring accessibility, going back to the points made earlier about a similar way of reporting; the criteria people are measuring against; the different means of gathering data from sources, particularly from customers themselves; and who is charge of that.  We have a key role in monitoring the success of policies, programmes and strategies so one could say we are guiding on the monitoring systems and devising that.  We are monitoring what is there in a sense but it is very much built on the information that is available to us and our awareness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>In respect of driving that change, there could be a website or somewhere people could go to make complaints if they wanted to do so.

Obviously, it would not be our intention for the service to disimprove.  The tender process is not based on price alone, but we also look at quality, and one of the quality elements is the accessibility which is offered.  I am not aware of any disimprovements in the service level and it would not be our intention that this would happen.  Even if it occurred as a result of a pricing issue, because a tender process is being undertaken, we would try to recover that as quickly as possible, with the two years requirement to have a wheelchair accessible vehicle on the service.  As I said, I am not aware of anything that has happened in that case.<\/p> <p>  On the next stop announcements on the DART, we had some indication and there has been some scoping work done with an initial costing of &euro;30 million put on that.  We need to re-examine it.  We are only at the very early stages of that, working with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to develop that project.  We would like to commence that project this year.  We do not know at this point, but it could take a year or two years to implement because we are talking about the whole communications system, both visual and audible, across the DART system.  It definitely needs a good investment.<\/p> <p>  On powers and legislation, while we have some compulsory acquisition powers, if compulsory acquisition is required to do bus stop works, we would ask the local authorities to use their powers in that area.  If we need to step in, we have the facility to do that.  When we did the work with the Irish Wheelchair Association on access to the wheelchair space on Dublin Bus, one issue that Dublin Bus raised with us is that its drivers cannot force people out of the space.  They can only encourage them.  Its by-laws and the primary legislation does not allow them to enforce a movement.  It is another matter whether we wish to take that route but we want to examine, along with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, whether there should be a change in legislation.  No decision has been made on that but we are working through the Department on the matter.<\/p> <p>  Responding to Senator Dolan who raised the matter of the 24 hour notice, we are concerned that even when it is given, it is not working.  We know there are issues on this as a service provider, but also the requirement to have the notice at all.  We want to work with the operators, as I have indicated, to try to remove the notice.  Our target is to have 100% universally accessible public transport without notice periods.  As to how long that would take, at current funding levels it would be very many years.  We will give the committee a note of what would be required for the areas that we would target and the type of infrastructure that we would prioritise to make significant steps towards that target.  We supplied the committee with information which gives an indication of the cost relating to railway stations, where the improvements would cost around &euro;80 million.  Regarding bus stations, Bus &Eacute;ireann wants to revisit the cost associated with it, but in that case improving the infrastructure would also be in the tens of millions.  Our key target is to have 100% universally accessible public transport.  Many elements must be targeted to deliver that, and funding is required to help us do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#M01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1517405400,"counter":1186,"content":"<p>Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>I apologise that our Chairman had to leave.

I picked up on something in the NTA's opening statement where it refers to Cobh, which is a good example of what I am thinking of.  Accessibility has been put in place but it has lost a stationmaster.  People feel aggrieved that there is no person at the end of their journey.  There might be only one person disembarking from a train and there is no one there for the purposes of safety and security.  Is it the case that now all the disability issues are covered, we can just dismantle the manpower?

We know that as a result of that, there are issues when someone who needs assistance wants to travel.  That is why the 24 hour notice is required.  There is a trade-off between notice required and the level of service that is available and the cost associated with the level of service of having a manned station.
