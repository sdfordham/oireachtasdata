I am accompanied today by colleagues from the Department who have been involved in developing the range of options as set out in the rainy day fund consultation paper.<\/p><p>I begin by providing some background and context to the proposal on the setting up of a rainy day fund.  The concept was originally mooted by my predecessor as part of the Summer Economic Statement, SES, in 2016.  It was announced that once the medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, of a balanced budget was achieved, a rainy day fund would be set up.  The establishment of the fund forms part of a wider policy commitment to sound and sensible public finances.  It will play an important role in creating a budgetary safety buffer to help absorb inevitable future shocks to our economy, while at the same time ensuring the long-term health of Ireland&rsquo;s public finances.  In the 2017 Summer Economic Statement, the Government committed to consulting the Oireachtas before bringing forward detailed proposals.<\/p><p>The initial proposal for a rainy day fund envisaged an annual contribution of &euro;1 billion per annum to commence post-achievement of the medium-term objective.  Subsequently, the Government reduced the planned contribution to &euro;500 million per annum for the years 2019 to 2021 in order to fund capital expenditure over the same period.  The level of contributions thereafter was left as an open question and it is one of the many topics on which I welcome the committee's views today.  <\/p><p>In budget 2018, I announced that the Government had decided to transfer &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to the rainy day fund when it is established.  I published the consultation paper, on which the Chairman has commented.  I welcome the paper I have received from Fianna F&aacute;il along with the papers from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Before I form any particular view on the specific details of the fund, I hope today to get some initial views from the committee on the outstanding questions I have set out in the consultation paper.  These matters relate to the design, operation and purpose of the fund; as well as the issues of how it is resourced; withdrawal triggers; and its governance.<\/p><p>Broadly speaking, the current proposal is to design a rainy day fund that will primarily meet budgetary demands which may arise from a specific, one-off shock.  As set out in the third section of the consultation paper, a natural question arises as to whether the rainy day fund should be used in the first instance as a contingency reserve.  It would be necessary to clearly define the circumstances under which such reserve funds could be deployed in order to ensure it is used only during a time of crisis.  <i>Force majeure<\/i>events which might necessitate access to the contingency fund may include a natural disaster or a public emergency.<\/p><p>Expenditure based on a withdrawal from a contingency reserve fund would be permissible within the parameters of the fiscal rules.  If at the end of a given budgetary year, the funds within the contingency reserve remained unused, they could then be transferred to a separate rainy day fund, the establishment of which would require primary legislation.  <\/p><p>These are just some of the issues outlined in the consultation paper which require further consultation on this reserve fund.  Other matters to be discussed include: whether such a contingency reserve should be held within the Exchequer account or within a rainy day fund; how the withdrawal triggers should be determined; and what kinds of shocks or events should be considered as triggers.  As I mentioned at the outset, I am keen to hear the views of the members of the committee today on these and other questions that I put forward in the consultation paper.  <\/p><p>Sections 4 and 5 of the paper raise questions on operational and administrative matters associated with the overall rainy day fund.<\/p><p>These design and operational issues relate to the deposit mechanism, the withdrawal mechanism, the size at which the fund should be capped and the replenishment methodology.  Other practicalities to be considered include how the fund might be invested, what governance structures would be most appropriate and who should administer and manage the fund.  <\/p><p> I will identify some of the key design concepts of the fund about which the views of the committee will be important.  The first is the deposit mechanism.  The proposal as currently drafted envisages a deposit mechanism whereby, aside from the &euro;1.5 billion seed funding from ISIF, there will be an annual contribution of &euro;500 million from the Exchequer until 2021.  Clearly, it would be my intention that the annual contribution would continue beyond that point.  Is this a sufficient level of contribution?  Should we be looking to bring additional seed funding into the rainy day fund?  How will name and determine the size of annual contributions after that?  Many options spring to mind.  One would be to have a fixed contribution key in either nominal or as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, or gross national income, GNI, terms.  An alternative could be to lodge windfall tax revenue on the basis of revenues above target in general terms or with regard to specific taxes.  I am sure that members will have other options as well.<\/p><p> In respect of the withdrawal mechanism, clear and defined rules will be required in respect of the events and conditions which could trigger a withdrawal proposal and the process by which such a proposal would be progressed by the various State actors.  International evidence shows that these triggers tend to comprise economic and fiscal triggers such as the level unemployment and revenue and expenditure levels, as well as democratic triggers relating to approval by the Executive and Parliament.  The design of these triggers will be a critical task in developing the fund.  They should be appropriate and relevant as well as being based on data which is timely and transparent.  There is a need to also strike a balance between sufficient checks and balances and a process that allows the speedy utilisation of the funds given they will be needed in a crisis.  <\/p><p> Associated with the interplay between deposits into and withdrawals out of the fund are the issues of the overall fund size and the process by which it should be replenished if it used.  The optimum size must be determined so that we have sufficient capacity to address challenges emerging but also while avoiding the carry costs of a cash or near-cash fund which could become too large.  Given the State's debt levels are consistently identified as one of the State's top risks, the State should always be seeking to pay down debt except where there is a better return for the State.  In this case, the rainy day fund provides resources to mitigate tail-risk events that would have a significant impact on the Irish economy and public finances thus justifying the additional interest costs on the debt that could be paid down by the rainy day fund.  <\/p><p> Once the maximum size is achieved, should annual contributions continue for the purposes of budgetary discipline or cease?  If they continue, should the surplus in the fund be used to pay down our debt?  I consider that the rainy day fund should be of a sufficient size to act as a fiscal buffer.  The rainy day fund should give the economy and public finances time to make the longer term adjustments to re-establish debt market access at normalised levels.  This is connected to the paying down of debt as the lower the State's existing debt level, the more sustainable the cost of debt from markets.<\/p><p> Subsequent to any withdrawal and determined by the target fund size, the fund will need to be replenished to rebuild the fiscal buffer.  Clearly, replenishment will also be influenced by the prevailing economic and fiscal conditions, which might impact on the timing of the Exchequer's capacity to recommence contributions to the fund.  Should the provisions for the replenishment of the rainy day fund be determined now or should they be determined post the withdrawal of the funds? <\/p><p> It is also important to note that everything we do must be must be compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as the Fiscal Compact.  The fiscal rules dictate that use of funds from a contingency reserve or payments into the rainy day fund would be treated as expenditure by the Exchequer.  Payments made to the fund are deemed a financial transaction within general Government but not counted as part of the general Government deficit.  Therefore, any withdrawals from the fund will result in expenditure that worsens the general Government balance.  In addition to all of these issues, the consultation paper outlines some options on the governance structure for the fund and how it might be managed with the NTMA indicated as a clear, and in my view, very good, possibility. <\/p><p>  I look forward to a constructive engagement with the committee now and in the coming months as we pull together the proposal and the legislation relating to this matter.  It is my objective to be in a position that allows us later this year to complete all the work that is necessary to draft this legislation to present it to the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, I welcome the views of the committee on the consultation paper and the different ssues to which I have referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#D00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

With respect to the Minister's predecessor, I think it is Deputy Michael McGrath who has been the champion of the rainy day fund for some years.  I will start where the Minister finished, which is around European fiscal rules.  In its submission, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, is of the view that the current exemptions are unlikely to provide the kind of flexibility the Minister seems to be seeking in terms of the rainy day fund and avoiding a breach of domestic and EU rules.  Has the Minister had any engagement around the design of the rainy day fund to provide it with the flexibility it needs to and to ensure that we are still in compliance with all the various rules?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about international evidence.  The Parliamentary Budget Office has shown us the Estonian example but it did say that there are a few other examples.  Has the Minister unearthed other examples at which the committee could look and make a call in terms of the flexibilities?  <\/p> <p>  I think there are possibly two different roles for a contingency reserve fund and a rainy day fund.  I think they are probably two different animals.  A contingency reserve fund might be something that should be there on an annual basis in the event, which the Minister mentioned in his speech, of some sort of one-off event.  An example would be the flooding two years ago.  In such a case, money could come from a contingency reserve fund.  If that is not needed in a year, the balance left in that fund can go to a rainy day fund, which is much more medium and long term.  Is there not an argument to be made in terms of good prudence for two separate funds - a contingency reserve fund and a rainy day fund, which is a much more long-term fund?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Does the Chairman want me to speak on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Just to brief the Minister, we have looked at having three areas of questioning per member as a first round and then coming back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00500","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will deal with each of them in turn.  With regard to whether there are any other examples of countries that are well advanced in doing this kind of work with a European setting, the answer is \"No\".  When we commence this work in terms of putting together a fund, we will be in the first wave of countries that are looking to carry out this work well.  In terms of compliance with fiscal rules, where there is an intersection with current EU fiscal rules, under the current fiscal rules, there is provision for expenditure to be used in response to so-called exceptional circumstances.  Given that I would only be proposing to use the rainy day fund in light of exceptional circumstances, there is some fit there but once we are clearer in how we want to structure the rainy day fund and how it will operate, we will have to engage further with the Commission with regard to that.  I am optimistic about such discussions.<\/p><p>The European Commission understands the distinction between the day-to-day challenges, the expenditure consequences of the day-to-day management of the State, and exceptional events that require a response from the State.  Given that we are only talking about setting up this fund, once we have achieved our budgetary objectives I am optimistic that we will be able to make this work within the existing rules and with the support of the Commission.<\/p><p> Regarding the Deputy's third question, I agree with what he said.  There are two different ideas: one is a contingency reserve and the other is a rainy day fund.  That is something I have introduced in my discussions with my Department in recent months.  I well remember, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, dealing with the flooding the Deputy referred to towards the end of 2015.  Something that struck me at the time was that when we are dealing with an event in our country that, for example, stretches beyond a county or even a number of counties but affects many regions and, therefore, has a high cost across a number of Departments, inevitably it involves, in the middle of the year or whenever it happens, having to open discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments on how we can respond quickly to something like that.  I believe there should be a better way of doing that.  That is the reason I am interested in the idea of this reserve fund.  In terms of where it would sit, I have an open mind regarding it.  I believe we could do it two ways.  It could be a separate fund to the rainy day fund or, alternatively, it could be a certain level or parcel of funding within the rainy day fund that would have different access criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#E00600","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

In its paper provided to us, the Parliamentary Budget Office pointed out what it referred to as mitigating risks.  In other words, having the cash on hand to react to events such as flooding would improve the State's capacity to deal with that after the event.  It also refers to immediate investment in preventing those events such as flood defences.  How do we achieve that balancing act?  Has the Minister given any consideration to that?  That would also question the need for a contingency fund.  Would the Minister see the need for the contingency fund but also the investment?  Last week, the Minister of State in charge of flooding stated that approximately &euro;1 billion would be needed to complete all the current flood defences and those proposed for the future.<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to the withdrawal criteria for a rainy day fund.  One aspect the briefing paper highlights is the way the criteria would be written into legislation.  The Minister said in his contribution that for a longer or medium-term rainy day fund, he might have to consider primary legislation in terms of the criteria and how we would access it.

Following on from the crash in 2008, the fund is envisaged to be counter-cyclical, in that we would address cases of deep recession and we should also have the ability, when the economy is overheating, to withdraw funds from the economy and try to stabilise it.<\/p> <p>  We had an interesting discussion last week with the Parliamentary Budget Office.

There is an opportunity cost when we save money, such as the &euro;500 million proposed for the rainy day fund, so if there is no real benefit in terms of counteracting a recession, is there really a purpose to a contingency reserve fund?  Using it in a counter-cyclical way is probably the intention and we are all of the view that we are trying to avoid what happened ten years ago from happening again.  A contingency reserve probably would not stop that happening.<\/p> <p>  The figure put to us last week from the parliamentary budget office was that we would probably need in the region of &euro;20 billion to put a counter-cyclical fund in place.  With &euro;1.5 billion going in initially and &euro;500 million going in thereafter up to 2021, it would take us nearly 40 years to put the fund in place with such a level of contribution.  Is that sufficient or if it is not possible between now and 2021, will the Minister would ask for feedback on the contribution post-2021?  If we are serious about putting in a counter-cyclical fund to deal with times of recession, the amount being put in must be greater.  The Minister's Department and this committee would need to investigate the opportunity cost to the State were we to go that far.<\/p> <p>  On the design, operation and purpose of the fund, I agree that we have far too much in the Constitution as it is and there is no place in it for such matters.  It is for the Parliament of the day to decide on this.  The Minister is also correct in saying there should be defined criteria.  I also suggest there should be parliamentary control and this should not just be down to the Department of Finance to decide when cases meet the criteria.  I am not suggesting we need 100% agreement, as we will never have that, but some sort of parliamentary control would be desirable.  I suggest a built-in review, perhaps every three or five years, to assess whether it is working and the ongoing opportunity cost to the country of putting aside substantial amounts of money on an annual basis.  It should also assess whether the amount decided to be put aside would continue to be sufficient.  Were that amount to be insufficient, we obviously would need to address that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister wanted feedback on the purpose of the fund and I believe its purpose must be counter-cyclical or else there is no point to it.  I would welcome the Minister's view on that.  I would also welcome his view on how we can go about assessing the opportunity cost and dealing with an ongoing review within the Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#G00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's first point that it must be counter-cyclical.

Perhaps it will not be all the Opposition, although I suspect it will be.  They will argue there is a better use for the money now.

When we have it up and running, it should be a minimum of &euro;500 million.

The more easily measurable one, therefore, will be whether we pay down debt or put the money into the fund.

Has the UK Government's budgets always included a contingency amount, going back several centuries?  The Minister is speaking about contingencies such as an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  He is presiding over a homelessness and housing crisis.  Every Deputy receives messages hour in, hour out from people who are in desperate situations.  This morning I raised with the Minister's colleague, the Taoiseach the issue of the health budget and whether the Government had made a grave error in the health Estimates for 2018.  I cited one specific waiting list for children on the autistic spectrum who needed early intervention assessments.  The Minister may know because it is also his district that the waiting list is well over 300 children, 150 of whom have been waiting for more than a year and some for almost two years.  These are contingencies for which he should have provided in normal budgeting.<\/p> <p>  I remember that the Minister said about something else that it was bonkers.  That seems to be a favourite word of his, but is it not bonkers to be thinking in these terms when the Government is not meeting the essential needs of the people?  Clearly it has not met them in the areas of health and housing this year and perhaps in education and others also.  If it cannot meet them, why are we talking in a nonsensical way about setting up a rainy day fund?  I look back at the record of the Minister's predecessor as Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, about which people will be incredibly critical in the future but not the media that tends to puff up Fine Gael.  However, others will look back at it and see the real austerity and setbacks people had to endure during the period, which we need not have had to endure because the Minister and others voted in favour of a blanket bank guarantee.  At this stage of our development, I look back on it as being bonkersand cannot see any basis for it.  The country has a debt of &euro;42,000 per citizen, one of the highest national debt figures anywhere and still greater than 100% GNI.  Why would we let it sit there?  If the position will be better in 2019, 2020 or 2021, why would we not use the resources to try to get back to where we were before the Government made the errors it made and the errors made by the previous Government in 2011?  At this stage in our history, the basis seems to be incredibly flawed.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about deposit mechanisms.  Has he given any consideration to hypothecation?  If he were to do this in the future and we were running significant surpluses, perhaps we might look at a surtax on very wealthy earners which might be hypothecated into a fund.  We had a pension fund which was our wealth fund.  We were not in the league of the Norwegians or the Saudi Arabians, but we had a significant wealth fund which the Minister's predecessor and former Deputy Brian Cowen totally got rid of, diminished and blew away.  The NTMA is holding a net &euro;14 billion, but it has to engage in significant refinancing in 2018 and 2019.  As the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Finance know, the situation is still dodgy enough in refinancing the national debt.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about emergencies.  I will take flooding as an example.  We have always known it.  It dates back to the time of the de Valera Governments in the 1930s and was something the State did not address.  To be fair to some of the Minister's colleagues, we are beginning to address it, but we always knew about it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Estonia.  There is a group of Deputies who interact with others in some of the Baltic countries.  Estonia suffers from grave infrastructural deficits and has a very small population.  I do not know, therefore, whether it should be used as a model.  By the way, Finland has a countercyclical fund, as we are told in the report of the Minister's Department.  Again, one wonders as the Finnish experience is different from ours.  There is no point in comparing Ireland to the United States because it cannot run a deficit or borrow.  I do not know whether this is fantasy or, to use the Minister's own words, just bonkers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00200","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>When historians look back at the verdict on the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, they will see that he was a Minister who, despite the profound crisis facing the country, made choices that enabled the country and our society get to a point the Deputy said we would never reach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>We took a different approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00400","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Deputy is someone who for many years-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>We had a different policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00600","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Deputy is someone who for many years said-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Luckily the Greeks carried him through one of the crises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00800","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>-----the recovery that is now happening would not happen and that the economic resources now in place would never be available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#H01000","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>On his contribution and all of the contributions he makes, I agree with him on the level of need and the many challenges we face in public services, whether it be health or housing, and I am committed to addressing them.

The Deputy's overall contribution proves the point Deputy Lisa Chambers put to me, that it is a matter of an opportunity cost.

In terms of the language used by the Minister, it almost feels we are in a \"Back to the Future\" moment, with extremely Bertie Ahernesque language being used in referring to there being more people at work then ever before, things being better than ever and so forth.  I sat in these and similar rooms ten years ago when I was very sceptical about that type of language.  At the time I warned about some of the inherent dangers.  I can understand the reason the Minister is delighted that more people are back at work because I am delighted too.  I doubt that anybody in the room is not delighted.  However, the tone of the language of quasi-celebration, with fist pumping almost taking place, except that we do not do that in the D&aacute;il, is strange.<\/p> <p>  The crash happened from 2008 onwards because as the economy collapsed we could not borrow internationally.  Around September 2010 the markets rated Ireland's debt costs as extremely high, to the point where we could no longer afford it.  Once the debt interest rate went over 7% - John Palmer knows these figures - we were basically out of the game.  There were many discussions about when the IMF would arrive with a package and the model it had adopted at the time.  Incidentally, it subsequently did not adopt that model for France, Italy and Spain because they were bigger EU countries.  <\/p> <p>  What I am hearing from the Minister is both intriguing and confusing.  At the time we had the National Pensions Reserve Fund which, if memory serves, was up to &euro;18 billion.  It was certainly over &euro;17 billion.  It was nabbed by the troika as our first payment under its package.  The money had been set aside, not in law but in general indicative commitments similar to the ones the Minister is indicating today, to pay for Civil Service pensions in the era after 2025 and potentially, although it was never clarified, retirement pensions paid by the Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I was never clear on the second point, but they were the indications.  I see Mr. Palmer nodding; therefore, my recollection is right.<\/p> <p>  We face the very same challenge on pensions, except that it is closer and higher.  If the Minister said he was going to set aside funding to pay for the demographic changes occurring in the country, for example, I would understand it.  However, the last such fund was taken in its entirety by the troika.  I stood in a room with a tall Hungarian - I was in opposition at the time - who asked me if we were prepared to give everything up.  The troika specifically had in its sights on all public utilities, led by the ESB.  The Government of which I was a member held it off and there was a difference of views on what should happen in that Government.<\/p> <p>  I am really confused.  Technically, I do not understand the status of the rainy day fund in respect of our debt level.  I agree that the current level of debt is a negative in the assessment of Ireland.  There is a profound argument that if surplus funds are available, they should be used, as has been done by the Department, something on which I have supported the Minister 100%, to recycle debt to cheaper debt at lower rates of interest or to pay down debt when it becomes opportune and advisable to do so.  Even in the scenario outlined by the Minister today, that would be the most sensible argument.  We would then have an enhanced or enlarging capacity to meet at cheaper debt rates in the current markets.<\/p> <p>  I realise it was the Minister's predecessor who came up with this idea and that the Minister inherited this horse, camel or giraffe - to be honest, I do not know what it is.  I also understand and accept his comments on the contingency reserve fund.  I was Minister in a Department which every year had to expend millions to deal with flooding, including in the Chairman's constituency.  A couple of months after we took office there were extensive flood waters coming down from the Dublin Mountains into various rivers; therefore, I accept the remarks made on the contingency reserve fund.  There is also the pensions issue.  Dealing with all of these issues would make much more sense.<\/p><p>The Minister has not yet said what the rules for this fund will be in the context of withdrawals, except to indicate that it will come out of public expenditure.

The objective is that if the economy gets into difficulty in the future, money will be available to us which we can invest in the economy to offset that difficulty.  I am struck by the fact that some of the countries that have been most successful in doing this, although they are asset rich, are those of a socially-democratic persuasion politically.  When they get into difficulty at a point in the future, they will be able to invest in capital programmes in order to employ people at a time at which unemployment would otherwise be rising.  For me, it is as simple as that.  It operates on a countercyclical basis.<\/p> <p>  On the other questions the Deputy has put to me, her description of the bind is correct.  If we put money in, it will reduce our net debt, although it will not affect our gross debt, as the Deputy well knows.  She is also correct that when the funds are used, it will count as expenditure.  However, we could get to a point at which we would have a choice between borrowing to fund expenditure or having access to a bank account in order to fund that expenditure ourselves without having to incur high interest payments.  Amid all of the complexity, which the Deputy was right to raise, that is the simple insight on which I am trying to hone in.

I was simply making the point that, in contrast with what Deputy Bruton said, there are some good things happening in our country and the economy.

The Minister can tell them that we have a given number of billions stashed away but unless he were to use the model of wealth fund Norway or some states in the Middle East and the Far East use, it would not count because it would be, in a certain sense, relatively small potatoes.  That is why the National Pensions Reserve Fund just got chopped at the time.  The Minister is talking of markets.  The markets are very tough.  I just do not get the technical explanation.  Although I am not putting this forward as a proposition, it would seem that if the Minister's objective is to improve the country's debt position, there is an argument for improving the country's gross debt situation because, in the long run, that will stand to us more in the context of the markets because they will see that debt is on the decline.

I am not putting this proposition forward with the direct objective of reducing our gross national debt.  I never presented this proposition in such a way.  As I have said on a number of occasions, this is about creating the capacity for the State to deal with an external shock in a way that avoids the need to borrow in the future at what would be a higher interest rate.  That is the policy objective I am trying to address.  A consequence of setting up such a fund is that it would reduce our net debt level, but not our gross debt level.  However, I am not proposing that we set up a fund to affect our debt metrics because, as the Deputy is correct to say, if that was my objective, the simpler way to do it would be to reduce the national debt in the first instance and pay it off.<\/p> <p>  On the view of the rating agencies in this regard, one of the interesting things is that the external rating agencies, which made grave mistakes in the run-up to the financial crisis, were actually more alert to the difference between Ireland's gross debt position and our net debt position than many of the analysts and opponents at home who were predicting imminent default at every point as the country worked its way through grave difficulty.  The other choices which the Deputy has outlined illustrate the scale of the choice involved in this because, if we decide to put money into the rainy day fund, it means that we are deciding not to put it into health expenditure.  The Deputy is correct on that.  That is why, before I move this into the legislative arena at all, I thought it valuable to have a discussion about the costs and benefits of the policy I am proposing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#K01200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair, I have the joy of being last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#K01300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>There will be a second round for anyone who wishes to speak.

I am mindful of the fact that a number of my colleagues on this committee from Opposition parties have highlighted the fact that they have been calling for this measure for some time.  If one was to be cynical, one could argue that members of the largest Opposition parties would be very keen to see the Government and Minister for Finance lock away much of the money we are earning from our prudent fiscal approach and save it for them to spend when they get into power.  Perhaps that is what they are thinking.  However, it makes sense to have a contingency reserve.  Really what we are talking about here is the process - what it would look like and how it would play out.  Will the Minister outline the kind of events he could see triggering the use of a rainy day fund in practical terms?  I know there has been upset at some of the examples which have been given.  How would this look to people?<\/p> <p>  On the funding beyond 2021, it obviously becomes harder to predict what these things will look like the further into the future one looks.  This is a medium-term approach, however, so I presume that the Department would have a view on how it could continue.  Would it continue at the same rate or does the Minister believe it would need to be ramped up in the future as budgets allow?  That would be my main point.  The Minister has already outlined that the purpose of this proposal is to provide a bit of extra security and a buffer for things as they arise.  It is hard to plan for every eventuality but I would like to get a clear idea of the type of circumstances in which he sees the need for this arising and the type of circumstances for which he would not see this fund being used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#K01500","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>The kind of things I see it being used for include global recession, which has a significant effect on a very small and open economy; a natural disaster of some kind; some event happening in the financial markets; or as a result of policy choices made here at home that lock us out of access to the financial markets again.  I used the example earlier of a disease that affected our economy and has grave consequences for it.  I was simply making the point that a Government can invest a lot of money in trying to prevent particular phenomena from happening but those or other phenomena can still happen and there has to be a response.  From my experience of being involved in trying to do that, particularly regarding extreme weather events, I think it is a good idea to have a way to access funding like that in a more predictable way than at present.  This would help a number of Departments, particularly the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government, to maintain their day-to-day commitments while dealing with the kinds of events that happen every few years to a country despite the best efforts of everybody most of the time.  I absolutely envisage contributions extending beyond 2021, otherwise, as Deputy Burton touched on, we would not get the fund up to the critical scale that would enable it to deal with the kind of events to which countries need to respond.  As a result, it will need to continue beyond 2021.  I do not see us being in a position to take billions of euro out of day-to-day expenditure and put it into this fund because of the pressures the Government faces each day in using tax receipts to fund public services.  The more likely sources of that money are one-off gains to the Exchequer, particular tax headings doing exceptionally well for a period, and putting in place an amount of money each year that is genuinely sustainable and which we are confident we can maintain for a number of years.  To approach it in any other way would set up expectations that no Government would be able to meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018013100002#L00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I agree with that approach.

Is there a risk that something which might not be seen as a big emergency in some years, a year out from an election, for example, could be used by a Minister to free up &euro;500 million for a slush fund to splash around the economy?

I go back to the point I made earlier.  Traditionally, when economies such as our own have had to deal with global events or the kind of phenomena I outlined a moment ago, the way they do it is by borrowing more.  That is a perfectly legitimate policy choice to make.  It is perfectly legitimate to borrow more and to respond to difficulty.  There are many levels of borrowing that can develop which act as automatic stabilisers that an economy triggers as it goes into difficulty.  One of the challenges of that is that normally when a Government needs to do that, it ends up paying a higher rate of interest on the borrowing because rates of interest tend to be the lowest when one needs to borrow the least.  The core of the idea is whether it is worth trying to set aside an amount of money to offset the effects in our society of tough external circumstances instead of borrowing the money at interest rates that will be far higher than is currently the case.  I am trying to portray the idea simply.  I am not running away from the inherent difficulties.  The moment we set it up and the moment the money starts being put in, people will ask why we are not using the money to invest in dealing with the difficulties of today.

The Minister touched on the European view on this matter.  It is very early stages.  I would have thought our European partners' view would be that budgetary issues are managed within the fiscal rules.  If there is no willingness to move from that then expenditure coming out of the fund would have to count as expenditure.  We would get no benefit from looking at expenditure going into it.  Could there be a European view not in favour of states establishing funds of this sort?  Would they prefer to see the budgetary process managed primarily through the current and existing fiscal rules set-up rather than states engaging in this process?  If we were to establish a fund - I cannot see how we ever would - that was of sufficient size and scale to deal with a countercyclical issue, the deployment of the fund would probably be in breach of the fiscal rules.

That is why we have so much focus on something that is simple in concept but very difficult to measure, which is the structural performance of an economy.  That is an ongoing spread of all EU economic policy at the moment.<\/p> <p>  On the Chairman's final question about whether the use of such expenditure would breach existing fiscal rules, my view is it would not but clearly we would have to work it all out with the Commission.

I think this has a great bearing on the country's capacity to invest in key areas such as housing, health and so on, which we referenced.  It might be helpful to this discussion to have a note about the off-balance sheet rules.  They have become much more Germanic.

I am developing a bit of understanding from the meeting that we are probably looking at two separate issues.  The Minister said that his preference would be a countercyclical approach.  The language is important because if we are looking at approximately &euro;500 million, that is not really countercyclical.  The Minister would agree with that.  We are looking at two separate issues.  If that is the case, we will need two separate types of withdrawal criteria.  If there is a countercyclical rainy day fund and withdrawal criteria set out in primary legislation, then will annual events such as flooding - which is becoming an annual event - be suitable for a rainy day fund or for the emergency contingency fund?  I know the Minister is open to all this at the moment.  Is he looking at two different funds right now?  Would that be the preference of the Department?  I think he has already said that primary legislation would be needed for a counter-cyclical rainy day fund, but I would see difficulty in putting a contingency fund into primary legislation because one would want to access it quickly if it was something like foot and mouth disease or a flooding event.  One would not want to spend three weeks trying to get permission through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will the Minister make that clear?  On the actual funding of the rainy day fund, if there are two separate issues, the &euro;500 million would, to me, be the short-term immediate contingency fund.  How will we fund the longer-term model?  I know the Minister said that one might be looking at such things as once-off gains to the Exchequer, maybe tax surpluses.  In that case, is it not very hard to define how quickly we could actually establish a rainy day fund of &euro;20 billion?  We do not know what once-off gains to the Exchequer could be coming down the road or what tax surpluses may or may not happen.

He summarised my own thinking on the matter, which is that we would look at putting together a fund which would have a countercyclical effect on the economy.  I will make one point.  Let us say we were to set up the fund as I am describing and stop contributions in 2021, for the sake of argument.  We would end up with a fund of approximately &euro;3 billion, which could make a difference to the lives of many people in our country if we were to get into difficulty.  An unfortunate effect of the awful difficulty we have gone through and are currently trying to get out of is that we have become a little anaesthetised to large amounts of money.  A Government dealing with a slowdown in global economic growth or a global recession that had &euro;3 billion or &euro;3.5 billion available to it over a couple of years could make a difference through, for example, putting in place capital programmes or providing additional work to people if they lost their jobs because of what was happening in export markets.  Amid all the debate regarding what I am seeking to do, that is the simple idea here and it could make a big difference.  The Deputy is correct to say that my current direction of travel is to have a particular fund that would deal with that kind of cyclical experience.<\/p> <p>  Second, I am putting forward for evaluation by the committee the idea that, either within that or separately, or even held within Departments, we should be looking at the idea of whether we can better plan for when events are more predictable in the future but will have a lower effect rather than being a crisis for the entire country.  Much of this is influenced by my time as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, when I had to deal with a series of flooding events.  If those flooding events happened towards the end of the year, at which point most capital expenditure had already been committed and most current money was gone, responding at the speed at which communities want could be difficult.  That is why I am presenting this idea for discussion.  I will see what the committee has to say about it when it gives its own views back to me.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has outlined the different ways in which it could be funded.  I have outlined them myself.  He is right.  It could mean that it could take quite a while to get up to a fund that would be of significant critical mass, possibly tens of billions.  I think we still lose sight of the fact, in that debate, that billions of euro spent over 12, 18 or 24 months could have a significant effect on people's lives if we were facing into difficulty.  The most recent crisis we went through absorbed &euro;120 billion of the State's money on the fiscal side to deal with the difficulty that we were in.  I hope we never go through an experience like that again but we will go through different difficulties.

Does it have anything to teach us?  Is the Minister exploring other options to PPPs that might free up capital or take advantage of capital in respect of investment in infrastructural projects?<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question on the HSE.  We have a note here that the HSE is potentially facing a financial shortfall in 2018.  Has that been accounted for in the baseline budget figures for 2018?  I will relate that to a specific example in my constituency where Tallaght hospital has two or three major projects, one being an intensive care unit that is at design stage.  The other project is a renal unit that had been approved for funding by the HSE.  Tender documents issued for it in December with the intention of awarding that contract in March.  The HSE has now extended the tender process until October with the hope that it can award the contract in early 2019 when funding may be available.  My understanding is that the problem lies with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform side of the Minister's area of responsibility.  The HSE formally confirmed funds last June but it is now citing an unanticipated deficit in the capital budget for 2018 arising from cutbacks applied by the Department in October.  That has now caused the delay not just of this project, which is not just a once-off project but is part of a jigsaw of projects about which Tallaght hospital management have been pretty keen and excited.  I would welcome the Minister's comments in that regard.<\/p> <p>  If there is a deficit in the capital budget, could the Minister confirm that funding is available for the national maternity hospital and where will it come from?

The benefit they have for the State is that we do not make any payments for a project until it is either open or finished.  That is why PPPs play a valuable role but I continue to take a careful approach to them in that we must decide on a project-by-project basis whether they are the right thing to do.<\/p> <p>  I hope and expect that the difficulties regarding the schools that are being built by Carillion will be resolved.

We had our first meeting on 29 November 2017.  Rural development support is the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the committee is interested in several elements of the policy.  The EU plans to spend almost &euro;100 billion on rural development policy in the period 2014 to 2020 through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  In Ireland, we plan to spend &euro;4 billion of public money on our rural development programme, RDP, during this period.  The committee met members of the EU Court of Auditors recently and examined their special report: Rural Development Programming: less complexity and more focus on results needed.  I welcome its recommendations and conclusions to reduce complexity and the focus on performance and results.  However, the future is unknowable and unforeseen shocks to the system can undo the best laid plans.  We need only mention Brexit or recent threats to international trade and the effects of climate change.<\/p> <p>  The committee has an oversight role in respect of the Department of Rural and Community Development and the following bodies come under its remit: Pobal, Western Development Commission, Irish Water Safety, and the Charities Regulator.  Pobal is the first body to appear before the committee.  The organisation disbursed &euro;615 million directly to beneficiaries in 2017, up from &euro;257 million in 2011.  Given Pobal's importance, the committee is interested in hearing about its past performance, current issues and future strategies.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am joined by my colleague, Jerry Murphy, who is deputy CEO.<\/p> <p>  Pobal, formerly known as Area Development Management, was established in 1992 by the Irish Government with the European Commission to manage an EU grant for local development.  We work to support communities and local agencies towards achieving social inclusion and development.  Our activities and priorities are shaped by the context and policies laid out in several reports, including the programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work, the Action Plan for Rural Development, the framework policy for local and community development in Ireland, Putting People First, and EU 2020.  We are in the process of developing a new strategic plan for 2018 to 2021 which will form the basis of how Pobal responds to the needs of communities and our funders over the next three years.  We will ensure that our new strategy takes account of the principles contained within the national planning framework when it is finalised later this quarter.<\/p> <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s work supports the delivery of valuable services to marginalised communities in Ireland.  Some of the groups supported by Government through Pobal include the long-term unemployed, young people, farmers, fishermen, families, Travellers, older people and ex-prisoners.  We have formed alliances nationally and internationally to advance our service delivery model, including close working relationships with the OECD and ESRI.  Our day-to-day work involves assisting on programme design, assessing grant applications, proposals and plans, managing contracts, distributing funding, monitoring progress, and auditing beneficiaries.  We provide good practice case studies, evaluations, and demographic information that support Departments in making policy decisions.  We make tools such as Pobal Maps and the Pobal HP deprivation index freely available to allow policymakers and communities respond to needs identified by these sets of tools.<\/p> <p>  Through our work, Pobal supports collaborative approaches to planning and decision-making.  We work to promote good relationships between the community sector, State agencies and other stakeholders.  In keeping with our goal to operate a balanced regional approach to service delivery, we operate from office bases in Dublin, Monaghan, Sligo, Clifden, Letterkenny, Galway city, Limerick and Kilkenny.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is our lead Department and I will later discuss some of the governance and regulatory mechanisms under which we operate.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, Pobal managed 23 programmes, primarily for four Departments.  The full list of programmes is detailed in the supporting information provided to the committee.  In managing these programmes, Pobal distributed almost &euro;615 million to beneficiaries.  We had contracts with almost 5,000 groups throughout the country, channelled funding to 4,360 child care providers which support 162,848 children, and supported 24,780 people in employment and enterprise programmes in 2016, with an additional 7,960 supported into employment or self-employment through the social inclusion community activation programme, SICAP.  This activity was achieved with an average of 356 staff, 45% of whom are based outside of Dublin.<\/p> <p>  Our total administration spend for 2017 was &euro;26.4 million, or 4.1% of programme costs.  This is down from 5.68% in 2008, 4.60% in 2015 and 4.44 % in 2016.  Pobal&rsquo;s work has grown significantly in recent years, with the amount of funds disbursed rising from &euro;257 million in 2011 to the current level of &euro;615 million in 2017.  Significant amounts of that growth have taken place within the early years sector, as support to parents and child care providers has grown.<\/p> <p>  In preparing for today, we decided to focus in detail on those programmes which we administer on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Members should have a separate briefing paper detailing these programmes.  If members of the committee have any questions on other programmes, I and my team would be happy to furnish them with the details at a later stage. <\/p> <p>  Over the course of our 25 years, Pobal has evolved in response to Government priorities.  We are dedicated to supporting communities and civic society in responding to local needs.  Our board and staff are committed to supporting Government in its work to make Ireland a fairer place to live for all of our communities.  We are also aware of the need to ensure that our procedures are fair, not overly burdensome and are appropriate to the size of the funds being allocated.  This is not easy in a world where there is a need and expectation for increased governance, oversight and financial prudence.<\/p> <p>  It is company policy to identify the minimum data requirements needed for the effective administration of a given scheme.  However, issues such as European level data requirements must be factored into this design process.  Key achievements over the past 12 months have included reducing by more than one third the non-financial annual reporting requirements under the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, significantly reducing the minimum participant information required under the new SICAP programme for 2018 to 2022  as of 1 January 2018, and reducing some of the contractual obligations on seniors alert scheme community groups.<\/p> <p>  We recognise that there is significantly more work to do on this area and it will be an important element of our new strategic plan.  We are increasingly using online platforms as a measure for reducing red tape while at the same time ensuring sufficient checks, balances and audit trails are in place to protect taxpayers' money.  The seniors alert scheme is a good example of a technical solution that was delivered by Pobal and the Department to reduce administration and delays in getting personal monitored alarms fitted in vulnerable older people&rsquo;s homes.  We can turn requests for personal monitored alarms around within a 24-hour period, or shorter in the case of emergencies.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, Pobal has established a formal feedback and engagement process, which ensures that the voice of beneficiary organisations are factored into operational decision-making.  As part of this project, an independent organisation was recently commissioned to undertake a series of workshops to identify areas for improvement in Pobal&rsquo;s administration of grants on behalf of Government.  This report, currently in draft stage, has highlighted a number of successes as well as areas for development and improvement.  The report finds that among beneficiaries in the social inclusion sector, 85% believed that Pobal provides clear guidance and information on the application process, 76% reported that Pobal provides good customer service, and 78% reported that training events are useful and helpful.  The issue of the level of information required by Pobal was identified as an area for possible improvement and, as I have mentioned, a number of steps have been and continue to be implemented to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiary organisations.<\/p> <p>  A commitment to social inclusion is at the heart of Pobal.  While there have been improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic landscape, there are still a number of key issues requiring attention, funding and collaborative solutions.  A few key findings from our 2016 deprivation index are that affluence is highest in the urban peripheries and gradually declines as one moves towards rural locations.  Dublin has fared the best over the past ten years, being less impacted by the effects of the recession, as well as disproportionately benefiting from the recent years of recovery.  Small towns of 1,000 of 5,000 people have been the worst affected over the past ten years, having been disproportionately hit by the recession and benefiting less from the recovery than the most urban and the most rural areas.  We would also attest to the need for further targeted initiatives and responses for those on the margins of our society.<\/p> <p>  Pobal operates on the basis of a framework agreement with the Department of Rural and Community Development and programme-specific service level agreements with individual Departments.<\/p><p>Each year a programme of work is agreed with each Department for any work Pobal is requested to undertake.<\/p><p> Key features of Pobal's governance structures include that members of the board work on a voluntary basis and are appointed at the discretion of the Government.  The State board appointment process is utilised by the Department of Rural and Community Development for the initial selection of interested and suitable parties to be appointed to the board.  The term of office of our current chairperson, Mr. Seamus Boland, is due to conclude in 2018 and I expect a new chair-designate will be before the joint committee later this year.<\/p><p> Pobal is responsible for adhering to all relevant legislative provisions, Department circulars, guidelines and public financial procedures issued by the Government.  We are subject to the 2016 code of governance for non-commercial State bodies and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General annually.  Pobal is registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority and is fully compliant with all its obligations in that regard.  Pobal reports to Departments through regular governance meetings, and delivery of programme reports and data and is subject to regular audits by Departments.<\/p><p> Over time, Pobal has adapted its skill sets and competencies to respond to the changes and challenges in the socio-economic landscape.  We are in the process of developing a new strategic plan, while also undertaking a leadership review of the organisation.  It is hoped both processes will ensure the organisation is lean, fit for purpose and responsive to the future needs of communities and government.<\/p><p> It goes without saying that the unsung heroes of the work in which we are involved are the boards, committees and volunteers that work to make their communities better places to live.  A great strength of community development is that it emerges from communities.  The State relies heavily on community groups to deliver services.  Pobal, with 25 years of experience, supports the continued sustainability of these services in towns and villages throughout Ireland.  As the chief executive officer of the organisation, I am confident in the work Pobal delivers daily.  As the company continues to grow and adapt to the requirements of Government, we have the expertise and people needed to support communities in future.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to appear before the joint committee.

Having been involved in many boards and committees on a voluntary basis, I would have liked an opportunity to review the 23 programmes being rolled out by Pobal because I would be able to connect to many of them.<\/p><p>Some years ago, a new social inclusion programme was introduced which focused initially on farmers and fishermen.  It subsequently changed, however, and in west Cork it became more focused on Roma and other sections of society that have nothing to do with my area.  This was a serious blow because farmers and fishermen, especially those on low incomes, lost a great advisory service provided under the programme.  While I do not know what form the new social inclusion programme will take and I do not seek to discredit anyone, there are no Roma in Goleen, Bandon or anywhere else in west Cork.  I do not know why discussions on the ground did not filter back to the needs of the constituency I represent and, I presume, many more constituencies.  I ask the witnesses to clarify that matter.<\/p><p>Pobal probably has some connections with the Leader programme, which is basically no longer available.  With only two years left of the current programme, there has been little or no delivery to the community and voluntary sector.  This is alarming to say the least and it will be a scramble to the line to have the available moneys disbursed to community and voluntary groups.  These organisations, all of which are voluntary, receive a small amount of funding and deliver a large number of services.  The people involved do not receive any payment for the many hours of work they do.  They have been telephoning politicians trying to secure Leader funding as this used to be available to them.  The number of hoops they must now jump through means many of them have decided to forget it.<\/p><p>The West Cork Development Partnership, an excellent group that previously delivered the Leader programme, was wiped off the face of the earth for no reason.  We no longer have a programme in the area and I understand it is now delivered through the Aran Islands.  This is mind-boggling and questions need to be answered because it will probably lead to an inquiry in a few years.  While that issue may not have anything to do with the witnesses, there is no harm in letting them know how people on the ground feel.<\/p><p>Pobal delivers the community services programme.  I am often asked the same question about the schemes operated under this programme, some of which were allowed to appoint managers.  If a manager retires, can he or she seek redundancy from the community group in question?  This is a serious concern for the community and voluntary sector because many of these groups are being asked this question by managers contemplating retirement.  The programme has been in place for many years.  Who would fund redundancy payments?  Voluntary organisations are extremely worried that they may be expected to do so.<\/p><p>Payment for bank holidays and so forth is also a grey area.  Many issues arise regarding section 39 funding, which I accept is not the business of Pobal.  However, the bottom line with the community service programme is that Pobal provides funding to the voluntary organisations which must then administer the funding.  This is a significant burden and things fall between the cracks.  Some of the organisations are concerned that workers may be entitled to payment for bank holidays on which they do not work.  They fear they may end up in serious trouble.  In one case, a group was fined &euro;4,000 by Pobal, which was a scandalous decision.  The group in question bought a work unit which community service programme workers could work in.  However, it was later told it should have rented the unit and Pobal would have paid the rent.  The organisation did the honest thing by buying the work unit from its funding and applying a small charge on Pobal, which refused to pay it and asked for the money to be returned.  This is brutal for a voluntary organisation.<\/p><p>We need to consider what is happening on the ground.  When people see attractive programmes advertised, they may decide to bring them into their community on a voluntary basis.  They are then subjected to audits.  I was the chairman of one group where the treasurer nearly suffered a breakdown as a result of an audit that was carried out.  The auditor was ruthless.  I did not give a damn because the bottom line was that we were all volunteers.  I was not a politician at the time.  I told the auditor to stop being ruthless as we were all human beings and asked if there was an issue.  He replied that there were no issues and everything was fine.  It was as if he had to justify his day's work in west Cork or wherever else he visited.  This is not good enough.  When a group makes a human error, the auditor should sit down with the individuals involved and rectify the problems rather than fining the group because that could put it out of business.  The treasurers and other volunteers doing great work in their communities may decide they can no longer cope and will not want to be involved in what appears to be professional work that is way over their heads.<\/p><p>I am not arguing that Pobal's work is all bad but I need to have these issues clarified.  Where is the delivery in respect of farmers and fishermen?  Is Pobal involved in delivering the rural social scheme?  This fabulous scheme for low-income farmers and fishermen has become less attractive because payments have changed, which is a significant worry.  We fought bravely and successfully when negotiating the programme for Government to have the numbers on the scheme increased.  I notice, however, that the increase <i>per capita<\/i>in west Cork was among the lowest in the country, despite the area having large numbers of inshore fishermen and low-income farmers, primarily suckler farmers.<\/p><p>I would appreciate it if they might be able to answer some of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#C00200","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins.

I will respond to some of the issues and I might call on my colleague to respond to some of the others because he is more familiar with some of the questions the Deputy raised.<\/p> <p>  I will respond on the community services programme first because the Deputy raised a number of issues in terms of the audits and the burden that is placed on voluntary committees involved in that.  On the context, there are more than 350 community service projects nationwide and the Department requires us to audit at least 5% of them on an annual basis.  A set of rules has been set up for the community services programme by the Department against which we have to audit.  Some issues that come across to the groups - I fully understand that from a local perspective, one would wonder why Pobal or the State is chasing an item of expenditure - are against the rules under which the programme was set up.  They are against the rules to which the group signed up.  We have raised this with the Department and have been working through it to try to change some of the rules to get rid of some of these anomalies over time.  I also am aware that the Minister, Deputy Ring, is planning to review the programme towards the end of the year, which might allow for some of these pieces to be looked at.  In terms of our role, our auditors go out to audit against the rules of the programme and we do not have the flexibility to move away from that.<\/p> <p>  The results of those audits come to our audit, finance and risk sub-committee and we discuss many of them in detail.  It is fair to say the percentage of groups to which we go back to recoup moneys or against which there might be negative findings is very small.  However, there might be findings that relate to governance, to how decisions were made or to how persons were accounting for the moneys.  It is about trying to improve the practice of the groups when they receive the reports or where they get some supports from us as well around these broader issues, and we use these reports to inform some of that.<\/p> <p>  On the manager piece, while I will come back to the Deputy directly later, there should be no liability on a group locally in respect of someone coming to retirement age.  As for people seeking redundancy, we take a firm view that the contract with the individual is between the local group and the individual.  The support that exists, from a community services point of view, is a subsidy to the programme.  Because they sign up to this concept of community supports, it is expected that local groups would have a level of matching funding or income they would raise from an enterprise they are running and that they themselves would then run the programme.  On the redundancy piece, if someone was looking for redundancy or if an organisation had to make people redundant, it is an issue that must be worked through the local mechanisms from a governance point of view.  All the groups must provide a three-year business plan and a big part of our testing and working through those business case studies pertains to sustainability.  We do not always get it right but we do in the vast majority of cases, in trying to ensure they will be sustainable for those three years.  In that sense, we would not foresee that there would be a need for redundancy.  It is, however, the call of the local group in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins raised issues in terms of the Leader programme.  We are all familiar with the issues that relate to the Leader programme in terms of the slow take-up and throughput of projects.  To clarify, our role in it was to assess initially the plans that were developed by each of the local action groups, LAGs.  Second, it was to develop an ICT system to support the development of the Leader programme and third, we were required by the Department to carry out Article 48 checks at a central level on the Leader plans.  The Article 48 checks are often the issue thrown up as being part of the delay and our turnaround time for any such checks that come before us is ten days.  Moreover, we have kept to that over the past couple of years.  However, I am aware that there are delays at a local level and nationally.  There have been some changes made in the past number of months that have helped to speed up the process and we have noticed a good increase in the number of Article 48 checks coming to us to be done.  In that regard, there will be a significant change over the next period but I accept there has been much difficulty and frustration in trying to roll this out on a local basis.<\/p> <p>  I might turn to my colleague on the point the Deputy raised on the fishermen and farmers with regard to the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>It is likely that Deputy Michael Collins is referring to the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00500","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I will make two points about the targeting there.

That was open as a local opportunity.  Although I might be wrong on this, I suggest that probably the reason they felt they did not need to add fishermen and farmers was that the programme now includes a target for low-income families.  There was much discussion about farmers and fishermen.  The intention always had been that the farmers and fishermen who had been targeted in previous programmes were to be those on low income.  The idea was that targeting of low-income families should allow any low-income farmer or fisherman, in west Cork or any other area, to be a perfectly valid recipient of supports through the programmes.  There certainly should be no reason that such work cannot continue with those groups in SICAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1517396400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>On that basis, we lost a specific worker.

One of Pobal's roles is to protect the services and support the community groups.  Could an intervention be made to call for a review of Leader in light of all the complaints that are coming in?  We have raised this at this committee previously and a review is warranted at this point.<\/p> <p>  The T&uacute;s schemes throughout the State are doing fantastic work.  From speaking to participants in my constituency of Offaly, I am aware they are enjoying the schemes and are attaining valuable skills on them.  I could not compliment them enough.  A number of supervisors from T&uacute;s schemes have met me recently, however, and raised serious concerns about how the JobPath scheme is taking some employees from them.  People are very unhappy.  The supervisors are unhappy but the participants, who had been enjoying their T&uacute;s scheme, are suddenly being pulled away and forced into employment in which they are unhappy and are not attaining valuable skills.  This must be addressed.  I took up this issue with the Taoiseach last year when he was Minister for Social Protection.  It must be addressed because it is causing huge dissatisfaction among the participants and we want to safeguard the schemes.<\/p> <p>  The T&uacute;s schemes have been doing fantastic work.  In many cases, they filled the void when we lost our town councils.  They give participants an valuable opportunity that they would not otherwise get in marginalised communities.

I would like to take a step back, as this is a relatively new committee and my questions are not as specific as are some others.  What is the witnesses' definition of \"community\"?  What do community and community development mean to Pobal?  Is Pobal succeeding in the community-centred approach?<\/p> <p>  I am from Tramore, County Waterford, and always have been very active in my local community.  One issue that is repeatedly raised by members of the community is that smaller groups that are already relatively embedded in the community are buckling under the weight of administration.  Such groups are small and have ambition but they believe there is a time-consuming burden upon them and they have to go through hoops and loops to access support funding.  What can be done to support such smaller groups that are developing but are wasting too much time or missing opportunities because of the administrative burden?<\/p> <p>  Another issue which has been raised pertains to personal professional development, such as continuing professional development, CPD, in the early childhood development sector.  There is a sense that remuneration is low for what staff are putting in but that may be somewhat mitigated if there were more funding and support for professional development programmes.  Not only would such people have something more to offer to their communities but there would be an appreciation of what they do and that they are moving towards more professional academic qualifications and would then have more to offer to organisations such as Pobal.<\/p> <p>  There is a sense that the outcomes to which Pobal looks are very prescribed.  The area of climate change was mentioned by the Chair.  As a society, we will have to adapt not just to environmental but also social and cultural changes.  I wonder about the ability to have emerging, rather than prescribed, outcomes.  We will need a society that is able to adapt, emerge and be creative.  People in the community are our leaders and we should be looking to them as to how to develop our programmes.  They should not have a sense of being told what is wanted from them and that they should not exercise too much creativity because that does not work for the organisation.  I would like for there to be more development in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#E00400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Pobal sees community as every town, village and city across the country but we look at it through a lens of social inclusion, equality, where the areas of greatest disadvantage are and from where the resources to address those issues will come.  We work with the Government to target those areas through that lens.  While some programmes may have a more universal element, most have a targeted element to assist those who need supports to have a better quality of life in terms of engagements with society, while taking into account people's broader issues people.<\/p> <p>  On community development, which also relates to the Senator's latter point, it is very much a bottom-up approach.  Needs are identified at a local level and plans are then worked through to respond to those needs.  That is our definition of community development.  However, we sometimes struggle with defining or working through the programmes as to how they might match that in the most effective way because there is a clear requirement for accountability for the funding and taxpayers' money spent on each area.  Trying to get that match can be difficult.<\/p> <p>  To return to the Senator's point on people's creativity or innovation in responding to their local needs, a key challenge for us is that because an idea does not fit a particular box there may be no scope for it to be funded or worked through.  We will address that challenge over the course of our next strategic plan and the next few years in terms of matching that in a better way.

As an organisation working on behalf of the Government, we are channelling many services through local communities.  If we do not actively support them, we will all lose, including communities.  The senior alert scheme is a good example of where there has been a series of changes in legislation which have lead to more onerous demands being placed on groups.  Garda vetting is one such demand.  The group is linking directly with vulnerable older people in their homes and the law now provides that the person who goes to people's homes has to be vetted.  That is a large additional burden on a group.  We have tried to put processes in place in order that we can make these arrangements for groups in order that they will not have to carry all of the bureaucracy.  We have also taken other bits of the bureaucracy off them that they had to manage in the past, in particular finding all of their own equipment and going through tendering processes.  We now control these things centrally.  We have worked with local volunteer centres to make the Garda vetting process available to them.  The feedback we are getting is that once people have been through the training process, the committees see that they have to be on board in dealing with the issues they might have viewed as a burden previously.  We are the messengers and the face of the centre for groups and making these demands.<\/p> <p>  On further professional development in the early years sector, I point to two things.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been providing money for us for a number of years for an active learner fund that offers direct funding for training for people within the early years sector.  It has been an effective fund and very useful for people within the sector.  I flag that there is work ongoing between us and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to look at the further need for professional development and how it could be delivered.  It is a need which is very much a recognised within the sector.

This is seriously curtailing the benefit that can be delivered by the schemes.  It is something of which the Leader groups and those administering the rural social scheme are acutely aware.  I remember back in 2007 and 2008 that it boiled down to who prepared traffic management plans.  The Leader groups or companies trained somebody to prepare the plans which previously had been signed off on by the council engineer.  However, they were told that they could not do so.  It nullifies and negates much of the positive work that is being done and that can be done.  It may not be the role of Pobal to sort it out, but it has a responsibility, with the local authority groups and Leader companies, to put something in place quickly to prevent the demise of the schemes and their benefit to the areas in question.  That is not a criticism but a comment on something that is hitting us hard in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Last week my group in Belclare in Tuam, County Galway received its paperwork to fill in for next year's rural social scheme programme.  I compared it to what had happened in the first year the scheme was run in terms of the documentation required from the sponsoring group.  I question the need for some of it.  It has applied for so many years to seek to provide a scheme, a work schedule, in engaging with the supervisor and the Leader company.  Every year there is an additional request that something else be provided.  For instance, this year groups have to provide health and safety plans.  The sponsoring and local voluntary groups are being burdened with a huge responsibility.  It is turning people against getting involved and signing their names on a piece of paper on behalf of a sponsoring group.  Some body, be it Pobal, the Leader company or the Department, needs to play a role in taking it back.

Any money spent on them, including the social inclusion and activation programme, SICAP, the rural social scheme or the community employment scheme, probably represents the best value for money achieved for any public money spent.  I would like to see it being proved, rather than making a bald statement they did achieve value for money.  From a political point of view, we need to see the value that can be achieved with a small amount of money.  With a little more money the schemes could achieve so much more for communities.

However, there are some things, especially relating to health and safety or other items that the groups themselves have to own.  What we need to look at there, and we have done it at times, is providing more comprehensive training and support to groups.  That is something we will be trying to address over the next three years as well.  I refer to Pobal being out there much more, involved in regional seminars, working with groups on particular themes and looking at templates that are there.  <\/p> <p>  We cannot work through those templates with people but at least we can hopefully provide them with the materials.  We do that on many programmes.  Doing more of that is where we need to concentrate and take away some of that burden from groups.  How we deliver value for money is my first question everyday.  The value of the work going on on the ground across the country is critical.  We are a management and administrative framework to that.  It is incumbent upon us to be as lean as possible in how we provide that service.  We measure the administration costs of the overall programme costs.  Those are declining.  <\/p> <p>  We also look at better ways of doing our work.  Technology has been extremely important to us over the last number of years.  I refer to online portals and online engagement with groups.  That throws up issues as well, especially in areas where broadband is not particularly strong or people do not have the resources to engage.  However, we have two sets of support available.  Most are online but paper versions are also available to the groups that cannot engage with that.  We ensure we are getting as much efficiency as possible through applying technology to the changes and we are continuing to do that.  There is much more technology that can make us lean into the future.<\/p> <p>  Most of our resources and staff are actually out on the ground.  The community and early years side of things involves meeting groups and involvement through regional supports.  They are one-to-one supports through the groups.  To lessen the burden on the groups is part of the critical infrastructure.  I will come to Mr. Murphy in respect of the outputs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>We take seriously our role in trying to assist the groups on the ground in demonstrating the value of what they do.  It is all very well for a group in a local area to be doing something.  However, the message needs to get out and it needs to be joined with the messages from the other groups around what works, what does not and what they are producing for Government.  We have invested heavily in systems, support structures and in data collection to try to give those messages.  At times, it is not popular locally because we are asking them to give us information.  However, when the benefit is seen of putting that information together to demonstrate to Government the value of their programme, people then see it is all about maintaining investment.<\/p> <p>  I will use the social inclusion and community activation plan, SICAP, as an example.  That was raised earlier.  There is an information system now in SICAP that allows us not only know what each group is doing but exactly who they are doing it with and to prove that, for example, in terms of the targeting issue that was raised earlier, we know we are working with the most disadvantaged people.  We also know what services they are getting and how they have moved from unemployment to employment.  Mr Leamy mentioned earlier in his opening address that our relationship with organisations like the ESRI is important to us.  We work closely with the ESRI.  It objectively and independently looks at the figures and what is happening.  It has been able to make very strong statements that the programme is working with the most disadvantaged and that it is producing a series of outputs. <\/p> <p>  I will point members as well to one of the documents going around.  It is called \"Kickboxing kindness and going the extra mile\".  It is an example of good practice not always being about numbers and figures.  It is about dealing with people with particular types of issues, how local groups have successfully managed to do that and then drawing those lessons out to give elsewhere.  We see that as an important part of our role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Deputy Canney also asked about people aged 55 years being asked to leave the scheme to be replaced by someone younger.

Part of our informing of policy and Government Departments will be about the focus that needs to be put there.  The recovery will allow us to be far more focused on those who need it most.

I will make a few general comments and maybe the witnesses can give me a sense of their thoughts on issues that have not been raised.<\/p> <p>  My first thought is an issue that I have raised at length with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  I refer to support for boards, voluntary bodies and voluntary people.  I am happy to hear the witnesses say they are committed to ensuring there is more comprehensive training and support for volunteers.  That is hugely important.  Volunteers and all of those involved in different boards right across the country give huge service and time.  They have to grapple with all sorts of form filling and trying to deal with a burden of responsibility as well.  It is crucial that there is enhanced training and support, as required, for those groups.<\/p> <p>  Another relevant point I have noticed in the few years I have been in this new role is that the most organised groups are able to benefit most from funding.  While that is important, we also need to look at groups that find it a little bit difficult.  Not every village and town is going to have people very organised, committed to filling out the paperwork and committed then to getting back more questions that require more paperwork.  I see it with regard to funding that has been approved.  I am thinking of Roscommon and Galway.<\/p><p>I would like to see other areas getting a fair share, but I think the issue comes back to people within those communities being organised, ready to go and having projects that are ready to be submitted.  That all fits under the community services programme etc.  That is an important point, one that I have raised at length with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring.<\/p><p> I have some experience of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in my area.  We have two rural men's groups within County Roscommon.  They are fantastic in terms of ticking the boxes for social inclusion.  The groups are made up of older men, many of whom are living on their own.  This is an important network and outlet for them on a weekly basis.  However, I am currently of the understanding that these groups do not fit under SICAP.  It goes back to the comments made by Mr. Leamy and Mr. Murphy.  They said it is a question of looking at needs within different communities and at what social inclusion means in different communities.  Certainly, in my view, social inclusion means providing funding and support for those groups.  Those groups are still operating but they are being run on a shoestring.  More individualised criteria specific to communities should fit under SICAP.<\/p><p> My third point has been stated several times.  It relates to the challenge for the rural social scheme and the T&uacute;s scheme and the importance of these schemes for the people who are participating in the communities.  There is a difficulty with people being taken off schemes and that is a major problem.  We know extra places were allocated for the rural social scheme last year.  That is great but in my area it has been difficult to recruit people.  It is fine having extra places but it is a problem if we do not have people to fill them.  It is obviously positive that we have more people back in employment.  That is great.  However, there is a gap.  Deputy Canney stated clearly that there is a gap, especially with people in their late 50s or early 60s who may find it difficult to get employment elsewhere.  That is certainly a point the Pobal representatives should take from today &ndash; I realise they are aware of it anyway.<\/p><p> I wish to comment on a more positive level about my recent experience with regard to the seniors alert scheme.  The changes made are having a real impact in terms of the people being able to access alarms more easily.  As the Pobal representatives have said, more support is being given to link people within different areas.  That is important and perhaps it is a template Pobal can use for other programmes.<\/p><p> My final question is on the presentation made.  I come from a rural area.  The Pobal representatives indicated that, based on the 2016 deprivation index, small towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 residents have been worst affected during the past ten years.  We know that.  The Pobal representatives also attested to the need for further targeted initiatives in those areas.  What future plans does Pobal have to try to target those continuing challenges in towns and villages?<\/p><p> I will go back to my first point.  I think we need to take a fresh look at how we support communities that are not as well organised as others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#G00500","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I will start with the last point from Senator Hopkins.  That is part of the discussion we are always having.  There is a call for applications.  We see applications coming from some of the usual groups that are well-organised.  These groups can write submissions well and can meet the criteria or examine the criteria and match it well.<\/p> <p>  That is why we are relying more on other tools that identify areas of disadvantage and the groups that are most disadvantaged.  The idea is that we are not solely relying on what is submitted to us.  We have other tests.  Senator Hopkins referred to the deprivation index.  The index is one criterion used within some programmes.  We are keen to see it used in more programmes but it is up to Departments to agree to it.  Increasingly, Departments are using the deprivation index to help identify where resources should go.  It is taken into account when examining the appraisal of some of the applications.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to some areas that may not have strong capacity.  We have capacity events to support groups.  The work includes building business plans.  For example, under the community services programme, an applicant is required to have a three-year business plan.  Sometimes we might work with a group over a year or two years to improve capacity at pre-development stage.  This can enable groups to apply for the community services programme and they can sustain themselves in the programme.  That is done over a period.  Anyway, I fully accept the Senator's point: we need to continue improving this area and looking for other ways to assess where the moneys should be going.<\/p> <p>  When we do geographical testing throughout the country there is a reasonable match.  Some areas lose out more than others but there is a reasonable match in terms of the resources matching the areas of disadvantage and where the target groups are.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the remarks of Senator Hopkins on the seniors alert scheme.  I take the point made by the Senator.  It is a consideration of ours.  We have seen how the seniors alert scheme has worked.  We have taken some lessons from it and we are learning how to apply them to other programmes we are involved in.  We are in the process of doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Deputy Hopkins specifically raised a point about men's clubs for those over 65 years in the area.  It was the case up to 1 January that they could not apply but now they are eligible, subject to the fact that SICAP funding overall is aimed at addressing disadvantage.  The funding would need to be for those over 65 years in a disadvantaged area.  Disadvantage is the common factor for all SICAP funding.  Anyway, those over 65 years are now included.<\/p> <p>  This is a good example of the fact that as we have left the economic crisis, the Government has had an ability to move on.  The last programme was focused on getting people into jobs.  The entire allocation was skewed towards working-age people who were unemployed.  However, as we have moved away from that, the Government has been able to broaden the categorisation.  I hope that example will be useful for Senator Hopkins.<\/p> <p>  The issue of supports for boards and volunteers was raised.  We accept absolutely that it is critical for relevant infrastructure to be supported.  Pobal tries to undertake a series of practical roles.  We produce sets of materials under a general heading of managing better.  They give guidance for voluntary boards about how to carry out the management of Government funding etc.  The documents are currently being rewritten.  At the end of the first quarter, they will be reissued in updated form to include the most recent changes in legislation etc.  We try to ensure that Pobal keeps in mind the types of boards that are applying for funding.  When we write guidance material, we try to ensure it is accessible to the groups that most need the money.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate my earlier point about the fact that so many more legislative demands arise now regarding data protection, child protection and so on and we have to face up to them.  If we do not, we could potentially be putting groups into a difficult position.  For example, let us suppose a group took on the management of money.  Then, three years later an audit is done and someone says the group did not obey the law.  We have to cover all those areas.  We try to act as a bridge so that there is at least a translation of the materials to make them as accessible as possible.<\/p> <p>  The scheme to support national organisations operates through Pobal.  It is a Government scheme organised through the Department of Rural and Community Affairs.  The scheme funds several umbrella groups.  One function of these groups is to be as supportive as possible, especially to communities of interest throughout the country that fit under particular types of headings, including headings of disability, educational or young people.<\/p><p>A range of communities are covered.

I will ask a few questions, although I do not wish to repeat what has already been said.  I value Pobal's work.  Its role is critical.  Community development is close to my heart.  I have worked with communities across County Clare and tried to help them navigate their way through the various issues that arise from time to time.<\/p> <p>  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have dedicated lines to particular Departments to ask about medical cards, social welfare benefits and so on.  Would Pobal consider setting up a unit that Oireachtas Members could dial?  There are many programmes under Pobal's remit, but Members could target their queries and speak to the relevant person or section.<\/p> <p>  There are quite a few groups, including some large ones, involved in the community services programme, CSP, in Clare.  There is a cap of 315 groups.  Is that moveable?  Pobal is considering whether to have more programme groups.

Without their input, we would not have the communities that we do today.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Hopkins about the burdens that have been placed on community groups in terms of filling out forms.  One community could be far ahead because of its people, so I would welcome more training sessions, information evenings and the like to upskill volunteers so that they might get the best out of the system.<\/p> <p>  Senator Hopkins also asked about the 2016 deprivation index and highlighted small towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 people.

I will need to check, but my understanding is that Oireachtas queries come through that line as well.  We will get the number for the Chairman before the meeting finishes and email it to him.  We deal with many queries on an ongoing basis as well as representations from Members of the Oireachtas.  It can sometimes be difficult for Members to raise individual sensitive issues, so we tend to deal with many queries on that basis.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the Senator for not reverting to her regarding initiatives in respect of towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 people.  It may be time to consider more targeted initiatives.  When I was writing my presentation, I was thinking of how we used to be involved in a number of dedicated programmes to small towns or areas within cities or some rural areas, for example, RAPID.  A new RAPID programme is being directly managed by the Department through local authorities.  Our experience of RAPID, especially in provincial towns, was positive.  It was not just about the money.  While money helped, of more importance was the agencies, each of which had a budget head, working together on the issues that pertained to the areas in question.  They were instructed to share resources and focus on the key targets in each town.  They then had to account to an implementation body in the town itself, which in turn had to report to a national monitoring committee comprising all Departments.<\/p> <p>  I am not saying that we need to replicate them exactly, but these were the types of targeted initiative that worked, especially in smaller areas.  Many areas identified different issues to be addressed, so this model allowed for a bit of innovation and creativity.  There was a small amount of funding to animate that or match-fund something that an agency or community representatives might have devised.  I neglected to mention that a good number of community representatives also sat around that table.  They were informing the process and challenging what they were hearing around the table.<\/p> <p>  These are the types of targeted initiative that we had in mind, but there could be others relating to, for example, people with disabilities.  We are involved in one under the Ability programme through the Department of Employment and Social Protection.  We were also involved in the Equality for Women Measure, EWM.  That programme tended to be extremely bureaucratic because of the EU dimension, but if there was one without the bureaucratic dimension that focused on gender-specific issues, it would be useful and appropriate at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018013100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517396400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked a specific question about the CSP and its entry points.  There have been no such opportunities in recent years because there has been no money, but an additional budget was identified by the Department during 2017.  The process is ongoing.  Thirty-three applications have reached the final stage and the Department is making a final decision.  My understanding is that announcements will be made on new entries in February.  There is no new set of money to follow that up of which we are aware, but we hope that the new entries will bring new thoughts, ideas and blood to the programme.<\/p> <p>  A number of men's sheds are funded through programmes that are ultimately administered by Pobal.  That it has taken off as a national movement is amazing, as are the supports it offers.  I will focus on the local issue, though, as it may be something that we have not got across enough at this meeting even though it is an important part of our ethos.  Of the moneys that Pobal is involved in designing schemes around or overseeing, a large amount ends up within local umbrella structures that make allocations to groups like men's sheds.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, was referenced as an example.  On average, each local community development committee is allocated approximately &euro;1 million.  All of the roll-outs are handled through local development companies.  While we work with the Department to set the national structure, targets and planning processes and set up the ICT element, decisions are made locally about which groups they want to work with.

I am the chief executive of Bord Scann&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, the Irish Film Board.  Anyone who has stayed in a cinema after a film is over to watch the credits will know how many people it takes to make a film.  People working on films include writers, directors, producers, actors, camera operators, set designers, costume designers, hair and make-up, electricians, set construction supervisors and crews, location managers, editors, post production supervisors, music composers and performers, animators and visual effects artists, equipment hire, transport and a range of specialist services depending on the particular needs of each feature film, television drama or television animation project.  These teams are assembled for each project and then work for varying lengths of time on the project, both because of the particular needs of each project - for example, an actor with a small part is only needed for a day or two - and because of the overall scale of the project.  A lower budget feature film produced for &euro;1.5 million and supported with IFB funding will have a four to six week pre-production period, a four week shoot and eight to 12 weeks post production.  A ten by one hour television series made for more than $2 million an episode will have months of pre-production and a shooting period of at least six months, if not considerably more, and further months of post-production.  A television animation series can take two years to make.  Each time the creative and technical team is assembled and then each member of the team goes his or her separate ways when his or her particular part of the work is done and-or the overall project is completed.<\/p> <p>  Film studios do not employ on a full-time long-term basis all the creative and technical personnel needed for the production of films and television dramas.  In most places, including Hollywood, film studios operate on the basis that a small team of staff manage the infrastructure of the studio and rent out the premises to production companies which then organise their creative and technical teams for the project which is using the studios.  Sometimes service companies are based in the studios but they too are renters of the space.  This is the case with all the studio space in the EU, including the UK and Ireland.  As demand for screen content has increased, there is a more regular, if not a constant, flow of production through the studios - this is particularly true most recently in Ireland - which results in regular work for many of those involved.<\/p> <p>  The competition in getting productions to locate in a particular territory is intense.  As a result only those territories with strong skills bases, suitable infrastructure and competitive financial incentives are able to attract that work.  Ireland has been very successful in this area in recent years.  As well as a vibrant film production sector made primarily on location and indigenously driven.  It also has three major television series currently operating in Ireland, one each in Ardmore Studios and Ashford Studios both in Wicklow, and Troy Studios in Limerick.  The feature film, television drama and television animation sector alone has an estimated annual spend in Ireland on personnel working in Ireland and goods and services sourced in Ireland of approximately &euro;250 million.  This is on top of what broadcasters, including RT&Eacute;, and other producers of screen content spend on the programmes they make largely for the local audience.<\/p><p>It is estimated there are more than 17,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the sector and the gross value added of the sector exceeds &euro;1 billion annually.  Detailed figures are expected to be published shortly in the Department-commissioned Olsberg SPI report.  It is understood the report will make recommendations for the sector to promote its growth and development over the next five years.  Also recently published is the BAI-IFB Crowe Horwath report on a strategy for the development of skills for the audiovisual sector.  This report, a copy of which has been circulated to the members of the committee, has a number of recommendations on training and education which are being worked on by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p> The Irish Film Board has a dual remit of supporting the culture of film and screen content production and the promotion of an industry for making film and screen content in Ireland.  Last week we launched our production catalogue for 2018 and we provided the committee with a link to it.  It has details of the following levels of production.  In 2017, the Irish Film Board provided funding for the production of 16 feature films, five creative co-production feature films, 13 feature documentaries, five animation TV projects, 21 short films and the cinema release of 27 feature films in Irish cinemas.  The IFB also provides development funding for all these forms of production and is the largest public funder of creative development, which is the equivalent of research and development funding, for the feature film, TV drama and TV animation sector.  In addition, there has been a particular focus on production in the regions, with film and TV dramas shooting in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Roscommon as well as in the Dublin-Wicklow region.<\/p><p> The Irish Film Board also includes Screen Training Ireland which undertakes a range of activities in training in the audiovisual production sector.  In light of the Crowe Horwath report, Screen Training Ireland is working on plans for the development of training across the audiovisual production sector and is engaging with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the development of its training services.  The IFB has published a report, Screen Training Ireland &ndash; A Year in Review 2017, and a link to it has been provided to the committee.  In the report, under the heading &ldquo;Looking Ahead: 2018 and Beyond&rdquo;, Screen Training Ireland sets out its work plan for 2018.<\/p><p> There are huge opportunities given the greatly increased demand for screen content worldwide.  There was a report today in the newspapers that Netflix, Hulu and Amazon will spend $10 billion a year on screen content TV series production in each of the next five years.  This is an enormous opportunity for Ireland.  As a central part of the creative industries, the sector can create a strong developmental environment for growth and job creation in Ireland.  In the five years from 2011 to 2016, employment at least doubled in film, television and animation production and it is anticipated that in the next five years it could, with the proper supports, double again.<\/p><p> The IFB hopes that with the publication of the two reports referred to earlier and the implementation of the strategies set out in them, the sector will continue to deliver on pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme promoted by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht of making Ireland a centre of excellence for media production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Hickey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I am employed by SIPTU as the divisional organiser for the services division.  Irish Equity and the film and entertainment section of the union sit under the umbrella of the services division and the arts and culture sector within that.  Today I will present on behalf of Irish Equity and my colleague, Mr. Graham Macken, will present on behalf of the film and entertainment section of SIPTU.  I will be happy to take questions on either presentation if the committee desires.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Equity group was established in 1949 to organise and represent actors in the Republic of Ireland with the objective of securing decent working conditions for actors.  On 9 September 1979, the Irish Equity group merged with the then ITGWU, which is now SIPTU, and became the cultural division of the ITGWU.  Currently, Irish Equity sits within the arts and culture sector of the services division of SIPTU and the day-to-day work is overseen by an executive committee of Irish Equity made up of members of Irish Equity who are elected annually at the AGM of Irish Equity.<\/p> <p>  Irish Equity has presented previously to the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the previous occasion being November 2017 to discuss bullying and harassment in the live performance sector of the arts.  At that time the union made a number of recommendations to ensure that culture change is achievable and sustainable, including that there should be direct co-operation and engagement between Irish Equity, arts organisations and training bodies to develop and monitor best practice in the industry; that the Minister should encourage theatre organisations to establish a representative umbrella body that can engage with stakeholders collectively on industry matters; extending the cover of the protected disclosures legislation to cover reporting of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment; that drama schools and arts colleges should develop at least one module on dignity in the workplace and creating a positive workplace culture; and that all applicants for public funding should have to have good practice and policy in place as a prerequisite for access to such funding.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the film and TV sector, I will outline the main issues affecting performers.  On the issue of bullying and harassment, it is interesting to note that the recent sexual harassment allegations in Ireland to date have related to the live performance sector with no evidence or allegations of sexual harassment having arisen from the film or TV sector here in the Republic.  That does not mean that bullying and harassment issues do not exist within the sector which is why Irish Equity invited line managers, producers, directors etc. from the audiovisual sector to attend an industry seminar at the end of 2017 on bullying in the industry.  The objective was to assist them with developing good practices and procedures in this regard.  The seminar was jointly held with Screen Training Ireland, SPI, and the Irish Film Board, as previously discussed at this committee.<\/p> <p>  Sustaining careers and living conditions is the most difficult part for performers.  The outstanding issues for actors in the industry relate strongly to their capacity to maintain themselves as performers and to have any kind of longevity in the industry.  The barriers to this are mainly structural and the Government certainly has the capacity to deal with it.  It is notable that these barriers also have a more significant effect on women performers.<\/p> <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Culture 2025 framework policy document published in 2016 identifies seven pillars for priority, one of which is to foster creativity by examining existing systems and supports with a view to helping more people pursue sustainable careers in the cultural and heritage sectors.  It is our considered opinion that achieving this objective means demonstrating meaningful commitment to the value of the arts in society and, consequently, the status of the artist.<\/p> <p>  In October 1980, the general conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, otherwise known as UNESCO, made a recommendation concerning the status of the artist which needs to be recognised.  The recommendation specifically invites member states to promote and protect the status of artists by considering artistic activity, including innovation and research, as a service to the community.  Member states should make it possible for them to enjoy the esteem necessary for the full development of their work and provide the economic safeguards to which artists are entitled as people actively engaged in cultural work.  This includes the need to improve the social recognition of artists by according them the moral and material support required to remedy their difficulties.  In practical terms, this means taking the necessary steps to see that artists enjoy the same rights as are conferred on others by national and international legislation in respect of employment and living and working conditions, and should see that self-employed artists enjoy protection as regards income and social security.  For this to be meaningful, there would have to be special provision and recognition for artists at the level of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Revenue.<\/p> <p>  Performers are one of the hardest working groups when it comes to seeking work as it is in their nature to be constantly seeking to create and perform.  They seek work themselves, have agents seeking work on their behalf and create work through all manner of profit share and low-budget initiatives, but when it comes to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection they are treated poorly and disrespectfully and when it comes to Revenue they are treated harshly.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not take the acting profession seriously and frequently tries to force performers into non-artistic work.  Even where performers undertake training to increase their suitability for various types of engagement, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection considers that they are not actively seeking work during this period and withdraws or refuses to pay jobseeker's benefit or protection.<\/p><p>Revenue consistently fails to acknowledge the genuine costs of staying in the profession when it comes to assessing genuinely incurred expenses.  We need to develop some clear parameters around this to support and assist artists in pursuing sustainable careers in the cultural and heritage sectors as per priority No. 7 in the framework policy document.<\/p><p> The freelance nature of the work of actors also needs to be recognised so as to extend to them the same protections given to persons engaged on a contract of service.  This is why Irish Equity has advocated and continues to advocate for the need to change the definition of to whom the employment legislation applies so as to say \"worker\", as it does in the Industrial Relations Acts, and not \"employee\", as it does in other workplace legislation.<\/p><p> Screen Training Ireland operates under the auspices of the Film Board and offers a comprehensive range of training courses for the industry.  However, we would like to see these courses expanded to include training or upskilling for performers.<\/p><p> There exists a film and TV sector stakeholder forum that operates largely within the control of the Irish Film Board.  This forum is not effectively used, however, and we would like to change this in favour of a jointly-led union and industry forum.  This highlights the general global issues of concern of Irish Equity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karan O'Loughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it and speak with it about working conditions and the development of the Irish film industry.  I am the chief executive of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, which is the national representative organisation of independent film, television and animation production companies.  As employers in the Irish creative industries, our members comprise a range of production companies from young first-time producers to producers of large-scale high-end film and TV drama.  Productions include work such as \"Vikings\", \"Ripper Street\", \"Penny Dreadful\", \"Room to Improve\", \"Red Rock\", \"Ros na R&uacute;n\" and \"Nowhere Fast\", as well as Oscar nominated films such as \"Room\" and \"Brooklyn\".  We hope the report conducted by Olsberg SPI Limited - no relation - on the economic analysis of our screen-based creative industries will be published soon.  In its absence, to give the committee a sense of scale of the industry, \"Penny Dreadful\" alone employed 1,200 cast and crew over the course of production.  This is a similar number to that currently employed by Diageo in Ireland.  In addition, the combined expenditure of \"Penny Dreadful\" and \"Ripper Street\" in Ireland in the period during production was more than &euro;50 million.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has a long history of supporting its film and television industry through fiscal incentives.  The section 481 tax incentive is essential in supporting Ireland's production landscape.  It has a positive impact on both indigenously produced content and attracting incoming productions, resulting in the creation of high-end jobs and contributing to Ireland's reputation as a global, high-tech, digital and creative content hub.<\/p> <p>  In 2016 Irish productions committed to spend &euro;265 million in the Irish economy as a direct result of section 481-certified projects.  This was the highest level ever achieved since the incentive commenced and demonstrates the amount of inward investment the independent production sector can attract into Ireland.  Incoming high-end TV drama remains the biggest contributor to this activity.  It increased from &euro;28 million in 2011 to &euro;161 million in 2016.  This year, SPI calls on the Government to extend section 481 in its current form beyond 2020.  The extension and continuation of the section 481 incentive is even more important when considering the limited sources of other national funding and the support required, in particular, for indigenous productions.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Film Board plays an integral role in the success of the local economy, providing funding and support for indigenous productions, as well as some incoming ones.  Between 2008 and 2015, capital funding for the Irish Film Board decreased by more than 40% and the Oireachtas grant for 2016 was &euro;11.7 million.  By comparison, Northern Ireland Screen's annual investment in production is budgeted at &euro;16.3 million, and this in a market significantly smaller than that of the Republic of Ireland.  We seek the reinstatement of that funding to 2008 levels of &euro;20 million.<\/p> <p>  As mentioned earlier, incoming high-end TV drama contributes significantly to the industry but the industry comprises a range of production companies, with budgets ranging from less than &euro;1 million to producers of large-scale high-end TV drama with budgets of over &euro;20 million.  Production activity is made up of a small number of large productions and a large number of small to medium-budget productions.  The pipeline of productions required to ensure growth and sustainability of the industry ideally should consist of incoming high-end TV drama and film along with indigenous Irish productions.  This balance would ensure a consistent pipeline of projects for a range of company sizes and employee skill sets.<\/p> <p>  An Irish producer company employs core full-time staff who work in the areas of production, development, administration, sales and marketing.  They develop original projects and go to markets to secure the finance required to make the production.  The core staff are involved at all stages of the production, a process that can often take up to three or four years.  Crew are hired at the production stage.  Crew recruitment levels and type are dependent on the available budget and, of course, genre of project.  For example, a large-scale period drama would require a large crew with a particular skill set for this genre and the crew could be hired for six months at a time, while a medium budget film would employ a much smaller number of crew members for a shorter duration, possibly eight to ten weeks.<\/p> <p>  A production company could have several projects in development at any one time over the course of a year but it is possible that only one or two of the projects actually get to production stage.  The timing for production of the project is dependent on available national and international funding.  Due to the project-based nature of our industry, a single production company cannot provide full-time employment for 52 weeks of the year to production crew.  However, the combined total of independent production companies can and do provide significant employment.<\/p> <p>  The employment status of those working in the industry comprises a mix of PAYE and self-employed.  Rates of pay and general terms of conditions of employment have been collectively negotiated between SPI and the ICTU-recognised film group of unions.  The minimum rates of pay listed in these agreements for the industry are well above the average industrial wage.  The majority of people working in the industry are, in fact, paid in excess of the agreed minimum rates.  Construction crew rates are above the most recent sectoral employment order, which is new legislation from October 2017, for the construction industry and the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, electrical minimum rates are above the TEEU industry rates for many sectors.  Production companies must, and do, adhere to the legislation that is in place to protect employees, as well as to the negotiated collective agreements.  This ensures that employees are provided with the best possible conditions while work is available.<\/p> <p>  The provision of training is essential and a priority to enable the industry to grow and develop new talent.  The provision of training is also a key deliverable under section 481.  The film industry is vibrant and has international accolades.  It reflects the quality of training and the trained crew Ireland has to offer.  While we do need a framework for national training, the reality is that most senior people in the film industry, for example heads of departments, started as trainees in the industry.<\/p> <p>  Screen Training Ireland is the national training and development agency for professionals working in the sector.  The agency is working well but requires additional resources and support to enable it to implement the recommendations of the Crowe Horwarth report.  One of the recommendations is a requirement to develop a national strategy for the screen industry to provide the strategic foundation for the ongoing development of policies and plans in respect of the audiovisual sector skills and the development of clear frameworks for the valuation and accreditation of training.  Screen Training Ireland, in its 2017 annual review, stated it will undertake a review of the report and seek to implement the major recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Screen Producers Ireland considers itself to be a leader in good employment policy and practice.  The #metoo and other campaigns brought the issue of sexual harassment into the spotlight.  These have empowered victims to speak up by providing a platform as millions of women around the world share their stories.  I am pleased to say that SPI and our members' approach to this issue has always been proactive.  In 2017 we collaborated with our industry partners, Screen Training Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, SIPTU, the Irish Film Board and others, including Equity, in providing a half-day workshop on dignity in the workplace, where we continued to communicate the absolute importance of a safe and respectful working environment and ensuring that individuals are protected in the workplace.  Following the workshop, SPI issued a suite of resources, including policy documents and promotional materials for display in offices and on sets.  We were also proud to partner with Amplify Women Collective when it published its excellent harassment and bullying practical toolkit.<\/p> <p>  The creative industries are one of Ireland's great strengths.<\/p><p>Irish-made productions are enjoyed by audiences around the world.  They enhance our reputation and provide high-value employment.<\/p><p> Individuals who work within this industry enjoy working in it because it is unique, creative and dynamic and provides the opportunity to work in a growing global industry.  Irish crew members are valued and highly skilled.  Their talents are visible on-screen and recognised by local and international awards.<\/p><p> To ensure the long-term sustainability and development of our sector, we require Government understanding of the cultural and economic value of the independent production sector.  It is vitally important that Ireland continues its long history of maintaining a tax incentive for production.  Without it, Ireland&rsquo;s production sector simply would not exist.  We call on the Government for an immediate commitment to extend the incentive in its current form beyond 2020.<\/p><p> I hope this very brief presentation gives the committee some helpful insights into the shape of the Irish film and TV drama sector and I will be happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Geraghty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir as an bhfianaise a thug siad inniu.

SIPTU was established in 1990 with the merger of the country&rsquo;s two largest unions, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and the Federated Workers Union of Ireland.  SIPTU currently represents more than 180,000 workers from virtually every category of employment across almost every sector of the Irish economy.  SIPTU provides the expertise, experience and back-up services necessary to assist workers in their dealings with employers, Government and industrial relations institutions.<\/p> <p>  The film and TV industry section of the union falls within the arts and culture sector of the services division of SIPTU.  SIPTU represents some construction grades, namely, stagehands and riggers while other unions, including the Building and Allied Trades' Union, BATU, and the Operative Plasterers and Allied Trades Society of Ireland, OPATSI represent the other grades in the construction area, namely, carpenters, plasterers and painters.  This group is formally known as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions construction group of unions and has the sole negotiating rights for the construction disciplines in the film and TV industry in the Republic of Ireland.  The Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, now known as CONNECT, also represents electricians in the industry.  SIPTU also holds the sole negotiating rights for the shooting crew grades.<\/p> <p>  I will now address working conditions and developments in the film industry, beginning with the topics of bullying and harassment.  The recent sexual harassment allegations in Ireland to date only relate to the theatre sector.  No evidence or allegations of sexual harassment have arisen from the film or TV sector in the Republic.  There is anecdotal evidence of a problem on the ground in the construction industry, but no specific complaints have been brought to the attention of the union for action.  The information to date suggests the possibility of an issue between workers rather than a structural problem.<\/p> <p>  Within the industry there is a genuine debate about continuity of employment for those workers who are categorised as employees when they are between jobs on film and TV productions.  The establishing of a special purpose vehicle, SPV, for each production means that a new company is formed every time a production is made, even when the primary production company is the same.  This creates a situation whereby the production company take no responsibility for workers after each production, even when there is little or no gap between productions.  It is a new, separate employment each time, so service does not accrue for the workers with any employer.  This is an unsatisfactory situation in any terms and the nature of the industry is not a plausible reason for this type of engagement.  The general construction industry operates in a similar project-to-project manner and has no issues with continuity of service.<\/p> <p>  In regard to employment status, there has been some general chatter about the widespread growth of what is referred to as \"bogus\" self-employment in the film and TV sector.  There has certainly been a rise in self-employment, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is bogus, as many workers involved in cameras, sound, and other disciplines insist they are choosing the self-employed route.  As a trade union, our preferred position is one of employment and not self-employment, which is why we view it as necessary to narrow the difference between these two types of employment.  To achieve this, we need to change the definition of persons to whom the employment legislation applies.  The legislation should refer to \"workers\", as is the case with the Industrial Relations Acts, and not \"employees\" as in many pieces of employment legislation.<\/p> <p>  On collective bargaining, pay and general working conditions are negotiated collectively between Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, and the ICTU construction group of unions for construction, and by SIPTU and SPI for the shooting crew grades.  We are currently making progress with SPI on an industry pension.<\/p> <p>  There is a definite gap in the industry when it comes to upskilling, training and development structures for the sector.  This has been a matter of discussion with Screen Training Ireland, SPI and SIPTU for some time.  It is our view that structures need to be agreed and implemented jointly to create sustainable and quality employment in the industry.  There are currently no controls on managing trainees in the industry and SIPTU suggests that a certified log book system be put in place for this purpose.  This would prevent trainees being abused by being kept as trainees for far too many years.  It also would ensure that all trainee roles are taken up by trainees, rather than by experienced people being used as cheap labour.  There must also be a structured development system for all grades so that there is room for progression.<\/p> <p>  With regard to stakeholder engagement, a film and TV sector stakeholder forum currently exists but it controlled by the Irish Film Board and is not utilised effectively.  We are therefore calling for the replacement of this forum with a jointly-led union and industry forum.<\/p> <p>  The continued funding of this industry is crucial to its growth and development.  However, there must be transparency and accountability for compliance with the funding terms, in particular where funding under section 481 is concerned.  In order to ensure value for taxpayers' money and to ensure that funding delivers quality and sustainable employment within the industry, we believe there should be annual published audits on compliance in respect of the numbers employed, numbers self-employed and the progression of trainees.<\/p> <p>  I hope this gives the committee a flavour of the current situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Macken"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  Obviously this is a very important sector for a number of reasons.  The first of these is the artistic expression it allows.  Second, it allows our country to tell our story.  To a certain extent, it is very easy for us to become a satellite of Anglo-American culture, and that is not a good thing.  Third, the sector adds a lot to the Irish economy.  Another important issue here, which is one of the issues on which we are focusing, is that so many individuals rely on the industry to survive for their bread and butter.  I believe that it is important that the State funds this sector but it is also important that the State analyses its funding to make sure it achieves the best output it can get.  Furthermore, because the State is funding the industry, it also has a special responsibility, a duty of care, to those who are working in the sector.<\/p> <p>  There undoubtedly are problems in the sector.  Anybody I have spoken to in the sector agrees on some of them.  The first problem I have noticed is the precarious nature of the employment.  As Mr. Macken has said, there is a debate concerning what is forced self-employment and what is chosen self-employment.  In my experience, in working conditions where there is even power between the worker and the employer, there is usually a better relationship between the two.  However, when the power is uneven it can sometimes lead to exploitation within a sector.<\/p> <p>  This industry seems to be structured so that much of the production happens by the use of special purpose vehicles.  They are designed for accounting purposes and to reflect international practice.  Those special purpose vehicles lead to short-term contracts, which lead to problems with continuity of contracts.  When continuity of contracts is lacking, workers can feel that they cannot access normal employee law or regulations.  There is the Workplace Relations Commission and employment legislation but if one's employment only lasts until the end of the month and one needs to stay in the good books until then in order that one can be employed on another special purpose vehicle, there is a danger that one will not access one's rights through that employment legislation.  There is a danger that if a person puts up his or her hand, he or she could be blackballed.  Such individuals could be seen as troublemakers.  In the experience of the three organisations represented here, is that a problem in the industry?  I ask the Irish Film Board to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#E00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>The first challenge here is that the special purpose vehicles are specifically required as part of the section 481 tax incentive.

Special purpose vehicles for the making of feature films and TV drama series have been in place.  This is not something recent and it goes back 30, 40 and 50 years.  It has been standard practice for a long time not just in Ireland, but throughout the rest of the world.<\/p><p> There are two separate issues.  There are the employment arrangement issues on the one hand and the structures of the special purpose vehicle situation on the other.

It is important to make that point.  However, within the period when they are setting up, employers and producers are obliged to meet all their obligations as employers and that happens.  I refer to the funding of the industry, how often productions are made and how long a time it takes to finance them.  We are not special children or a special case, but by its nature it is how the industry works.  There could be huge gaps.<\/p> <p>  There are also different genres of film and productions made by the same companies which require different skill sets.  I alluded to this earlier.  There could be a big build, a construction build and a period piece, a long running or short running one that requires a certain set of skills, yet something completely different.  In terms of moving from one production to another, it is driven by the genre, the skill set required and the number, because there are different types.  That is what drives the employment level and requirement.

A person could work in the industry for 30 years and still have no form of security or continuity of employment and everything that comes with that.  No rights are built up and there are zero protections.  There is an easy answer to it.  There is an accepted wisdom in the industry that this is the way it is globally.  Many things were accepted globally as the right thing for a long time but they are no longer accepted practices now.<\/p> <p>  The nearest comparative industry to the film industry has to be the construction industry.  It goes from project to project and builders can be involved in several projects at the same time.  There can be overlap in all of those projects.  They do not have the same problem.  The construction industry in general, when building houses, hotels, schools or whatever, has long periods of employment and short periods of employment.  However, between those periods of employment, if the builder does not have another project, the employees are put on lay-off.  They can take up other work or not.  When the next project comes along, the builder recalls those people back to work.  If the break is not over six months long, then it is all reckonable service for employment purposes, if the committee understands what I mean by that.<\/p> <p>  There is a very easy answer to this.  The special purpose vehicle is the small vehicle but the production company is the main gig and it should be the main employer.  If I am the production company and I have a special purpose vehicle and I want a person in that as an employee for that time, there is no reason I cannot be the main employer.  The person is then put on that production.  I do not see that as rocket science.  The situation makes people incredibly vulnerable in the industry.  People have to be compliant and not complain about anything for the reasons mentioned.  Individuals cannot stand up for anything because disagreeing too strongly might mean he or she may not get the next gig.  I am not accusing anybody of doing that in this room.  I am saying it is a fact of life as the committee has identified.  Where there is a power imbalance and a person feels vulnerable, then he or she is more likely to be compliant in the way that he or she works rather than assert rights to good terms and conditions, etc.  I do not believe rocket science is needed to overcome this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Karan O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Collins have a comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#F00800","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Yes, from a slightly different perspective perhaps.

I would like to emphasis though, in regard  to trainees and heads of department, HODs, that ultimately it is a highly mobile and flexible industry.  I not saying that is an excuse for employers to exploit mobility or flexibility, but in return for flexibility and mobility, individuals rise from trainee right up through the ranks to become a designer who will end up working not just in Ireland, but abroad developing their skills.  I tend to produce live action low budget films outside conventional studios.  I do not have a big construction requirement on anything that I do.<\/p> <p>  However, as part of that, normally I would be relying on my head of department to hire the crew needed to do a good job, such as a union crew, and if they do a good job, the chances are that I will work with that person again.

This is a major gripe within the sector as far as I can see because the training seems to have no beginning, no middle and no end.  It has no accreditation.  If a person looks to go into any sector, what he or she will seek is to know how long it is going to take, know what their output has to be and know the accreditation.  Once they have achieved that accreditation, he or she does not participate in that space again.  They move on.  However, that does not seem to be the case in the film industry.<\/p> <p>  Many people come to me and say they are being forced back into the same training spots repeatedly.  It seems to be motivated to an extent by the section 481 necessity to have a certain number of trainees on a production.  Is that not something ripe for reform?  <\/p> <p>  I am running out of time, so I will ask another couple of questions and then the witnesses might address them all together.  The other issue is that the Irish Film Board has the potential to run a forum in the industry.  Now is a good time, even from the level of development we have seen over the past number of years and where we want to go.  There are also these underlying problems.  Would it be a good idea to initiate that forum and give workers in the industry a right to initiate that in the future?  Different sectors would have a right to initiate a forum.   Would it also be a good idea for the Irish Film Board to have a representative of the crew workers?  The Irish Board would then have a broader more insightful view into the experiences of the different people it takes to make a film.  I know that is not the Irish Film Board's choice.  It is the Minister's choice but it is something that could be suggested.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of films, what is the break down between indigenous films and international films funded in the State at the moment?  What would be the break down of films that are successful financially and those that are less so?  Those are my three questions.

I am here as Screen Training Ireland but I work in the Irish Film Board and am deputy chief executive officer.  A number of years ago when F&Aacute;S was being dissolved and being folded into the ETBs, with SOLAS being the policy body, F&Aacute;S came to us and asked whether we would take over the training element of the unit that had been sitting within F&Aacute;S.  We were very happy to do that.  That is a very small unit.  This is a major piece of work that needs to be done and this is a small unit of three people.  We structure our training across production and technical, which is the subject of what we are talking about today, business and enterprise and creativity and creative collaboration.<\/p> <p>  What we recognised when we got into Screen Training Ireland is that we really needed to move the agenda forward.  We started the process of commissioning a report to get a national conversation on where skills were going in the screen sector.<\/p> <p>  Screen Training Ireland also covers live action, film and TV drama, animation, games, visual effects, new emerging technologies in VR and it covers television broadcasts, so it is a very wide remit.  It is a far wider remit than the funding of the Film Board of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We finished the report last year and we published it in September.  I would say it took us longer to complete and when one has co-agencies it takes a while when they are on different slip streams.  Let me bring the members through a number of the ideas we are developing, which will be an active part of the work plan for the Irish Film Board in 2018.<\/p> <p>  In the booklet we published, we set out all the training we have been doing in 2017.  In 2017, the Irish Film Board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, published the AV skills strategy report.  In 2018, Screen Training Ireland, STI will undertake a review of the report and seek to implement the major recommendations and these will include an advisory board for Screen Training Ireland, the appointment of a training manager, the engagement with the sector on the recommendations, a skills gap audit across live action, animation and television production sectors and consideration of accreditation models.  <\/p> <p>  In 2017 major advances were made in developing apprenticeships, however we recognise the scale of the work that still needs to be done in developing more work-based learning opportunities.  Many challenges still exist.  Diversity, inclusion, paths for new entrants and the ongoing issue of bridging the gap between third level and industry.  We also recognise that we need more hard data in terms of measuring the workforce.  Therefore in 2018, we will roll out an extensive careers portal in live action, animation and the effects in television production which will map careers in these areas.  We will launch that portal imminently.  We need to establish an industry education forum, carry out detailed research on the scale and the breakdown of the workforce; develop more traineeships and partnerships with SOLAS, the local education and training boards and third level; develop a trainee tool kit; and work closely with industry on partnership initiatives, especially around animation and increase mentoring, especially for female talent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#G01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa McGrane"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I would have had people come to me who have degrees, years of experience working in a particular sector within the industry who told me that they  get repeated requests to become part of a production as a trainee.

I have watched the university system over 30 years and it grew into a place that one would go to university to learn how to make a film.  A person went to learn the sociology, the philosophy or the psychology of film or the brilliance of film and learn about the literature and writing of film, but to make a film takes an awful lot of ability.  Students came out from university thinking they were going to make films when they were nowhere near the concept of visualising a world for screen.  This is why I use the word \"apprenticeships\", which I say in the context of the glory of the great mosaics of years ago, great artists of the stained glass windows, writers and dramatists.  This is why I suggest that the Department of Education and Skills is looking for validation and QQI awards within that.  The Departments do not, however, communicate with each other here, which I have learnt as an innocent.  One nearly has to go in and say \"This is the route you could take and this is the conduit where people could have exactly that\".  They could continue to be trained until they become mentors or artists of the construction, as well as writers.

When we talk about parent companies, we must keep in mind that most production companies and producers are actually quite small.  There are a few that are very large.  It is rare but welcome that there are back-to-back series producers.  I have had family in the industry for years and years.  It is highly unusual that this happens but it is welcome that there are back-to-back series.  To put it in context, parent companies could be two or three-person operations and beyond the office, we must consider how training can take place.  It is also complex because there are different grades.  Reference was made to craft.  There are examples everywhere of people who started as runners in an art department and they worked their way through.  That is great but it requires a particular environment.  In respect of craft, I am all for measuring training, monitoring and certification of some kind and it only takes conversations around these tables to understand how this industry works.  We should not, however, be afraid of that.  Within the electricians in a crew, it is rare to see a trainee electrician on a production because they are all trained within the union and we are rarely given trainees.  With regard to apprenticeships, it is great if they work.  Screen Producers Ireland has supported a successful apprenticeship programme for the animation sector.  Another programme was unsuccessful.  Any solutions should be looked at but one should remember it is not that we are such a complex industry, it is just there are a lot of grades, a lot of crafts and training will look different from grade to grade and from skill set to skill set.  We need to get around a table and to find solutions.

There are many companies.  Some are two-person operations and others are bigger.  Every application by every company that is set up is for a particular film or a production of some kind.  Some are small, some are medium and some are large scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Geraghty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>This does not just apply for applications for the tax break.  It is the same if one is applying for funding from the Irish Film Board.  Let us say that a project costs &euro;1.5 million.  Around 40 people will be employed full-time for between two or three months.  Perhaps ten to 15 people will be employed part-time for around six months.  The production company might be employing between 20 and 40 or 50 actors of varying levels of renown or notoriety over that period.  The amount of money a company gets from the State for that might amount to one third of the budget or perhaps slightly more than that.  The producer must raise the rest of the money from other sources internationally and must hope that it all arrives at the same time.  That is the volatile nature of this business.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, the top company is the custodian of those funds and it has a duty of care to spend that money as it has promised its various stakeholders.  If that company does not spend its money in the way it promised, the market will turn against it and its Irish stakeholders will turn against it.  A company that would behave like that would not be in business for very long.  I am a producer, and my line is, \"In dreams begin responsibilities\".  If somebody comes to me with an idea and I agree to help him or her make it happen, I then have to take responsibility for that dream.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut across the witness but I am going to run out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#K00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I thought the witness wanted a coherent answer-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I do want an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#K00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>-----which is that we are the custodian of that money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>We have a clear set of rules of what is eligible and ineligible.

I met someone recently who was a trainee for 12 years.  That is not acceptable.  That is an abuse of the category of trainee.<\/p> <p>  Quality employment, in my mind, cannot be defined as a hire-them-and-fire-them workforce where, at the end of every production, regardless of how long a person has worked in the industry, how many different productions they have worked on and what their level of skills are, there is no obligation whatsoever to take somebody back when the next production starts.  If that person has been asking questions about health and safety issues, pay issues or conditions on the set, there is no obligation to take him or her back.  There are allegations that this is happening.  I do not know how widespread it is but I do not believe there is smoke without fire.

The Deputy might pick up on the subtext here.  While there seems to be a willingness to address the trainee issue, there is no doubt that there is a serious problem with trainees in the industry.  We do not know who they are or where they are and they cannot be tracked.  They are trainees for years because they get bits and pieces of work and cannot count up their time to see how long they have been a trainee for.  If one is lucky enough to work continuously on one production after another he or she might be able to get themselves over the line.  If a person is working sporadically, it is possible to end up as a trainee for many years.  Sometimes, when work is scarce, it is hard for trainees to take up trainee positions because experienced people will be out of work and a production company will decide that it does not need another prop person but will offer qualified people the trainee position.  Qualified, experienced people end up working for trainee money.  It is a problem, and with the best will in the world, if we wait around for all of the reports to finish and then for another period for funding, the problem will never be dealt with.  Trainees need to be registered.  There needs to be a pool of trainees to run through the industry.  Collectively the industry needs to decide every year how many trainees it wants at the other end.  They should be pooled for all of the productions so that we get a more professionalised system.

Ms O'Loughlin referenced a camera operator.  A director of photography hires the camera operator.  Let us say one had an in-house camera operator for a feature film.  The chances of the director of photography, who the funders want for their film, hiring the camera operator is probably very small.  Therefore, one would build up an overhead but have no work for that person and also tying up that person who then would not be free to earn money elsewhere.  I am not quite sure if the big building analogy is appropriate.  We should explore sustainability with SIPTU in a serious way.  In principle, the goal of sustainability is a really good one but we must parse and analyse the position regarding shooting crews.  I think the industry works on meritocracy.  If one is a good camera operator, one has no trouble getting work.  It is not about prejudice, it is about a creative choice that is made.  These people, at that level, can command sufficient funds that if they work for six months they can take six months off, if they so wish.  It is a lifestyle choice that is hard-earned and hard-won.  In the film industry there may be pockets of labour that would appreciate sustainability.  However, there may be other pockets of labour that would rise to the challenge of a meritocracy.  We need an industry that encompasses both of those objectives.

As Ms O'Loughlin indicated, there may be people at a very high and specific skill level who can pick and choose.  Let us call it what it is.  In the same way, a few A-list stars can pick and choose their movies.  However, that is not the situation for the majority of people, and it is them whom we must discuss.  I accept that there may be genuine breaks and so on, but I can see nothing from what has been described of the <i>status quo<\/i>that would prevent companies from deciding not to re-employ certain people because they did not like them.  Some of the witnesses may say that is not going on, it rarely goes on or whatever, but we have workers who are saying that it is going on.  It is not necessarily up to us to judge who is telling the truth, but there has to be a structure that prevents it from happening, links public funding to guarantees that it will not happen and ensures that there is enforcement and monitoring.  If money is going into the film industry through tax reliefs or whatever and certificates are being given to people about quality employment and so on, there has to be monitoring and enforcement.  We have to know that quality employment is being provided and that there is fairness in the treatment of the workers.<\/p><p>Obviously, there is a pool of workers in the industry.  Step 1 is that, after two, three or four years, a person is qualified, is in the pool and cannot be discriminated against within that pool on the arbitrary basis of someone liking or disliking him or her.  That last aspect is what we must prevent in order to achieve fairness.  People might respond to this comment, but we must reach that point.  It is only fair to those who work in the industry.<\/p><p>If there is this level of money going into the industry, and I would like to see more, there should be more permanent employment than is the case.  I get the point about not wanting to employ someone for six months doing nothing but, on the other hand, the level of permanent employment &ndash; we cannot even get a figure on it &ndash; seems to be low compared with the amount of Government money.  That needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>There is something called the working time directive, which, if I remember correctly, allows someone to work 39 hours plus a certain amount of overtime under EU law.

The next questions asked if they reported it.  Of that 70% of respondents who had said yes, roughly 70% said that they did not report it for fear of not getting the next job.  If I heard that Senator O'Donnell was bullying her colleagues in the workplace, I would not report it, because I might be seen as the one who rocks the boat.

I am in a dilemma here, because sometimes the precarious nature of a job is its creativity.  Within the arts, people like to move, change or travel, to get different experiences, work with different directors or writers and so on.  That applies whether they are people doing hair or the main director.  The witnesses are right that precarious nature is sometimes taken for granted.  Nobody wants to consider the implications of this for an actor who is 50 or 60 years old and there are no more parts for him or her.  The same phenomenon of holding people in esteem exists in theatre.<\/p> <p>  This goes back to how we look at the arts and culture.  In politics, we are afraid even to say the words \"arts\", \"film\" \"dance\" or \"drama\".  We do not refer to them.  We include them in something else.  On the leaving certificate, there are 25 points for maths but not for music.  We will not say that we believe in this as a proper career where people could be precarious and permanent when necessary.  It is coming up here.  People want to be creative and imaginative.  They want to live in the world of the original, of beauty and that which is sacred and cultural.  It is hard for them to do it, whether they are construction workers, writers or actors because it is precarious.  Mr. Murray is right about the bullying, because it is free.  The wonderful words about the caged bird being free apply in the arts.  There are a lot of problems with that.<\/p> <p>  We have to get classrooms, universities and colleges out of our heads when we think of training in the arts, because mentorship plays a huge part in this.  I started as a radio actress, and I was around Daphne Carroll and Sean Ford.  I used to sit in the studio when I might have three lines on page 39 of the script and those actors were playing the main part.  I would sit in awe of these great actors with voices and experience, and that is when one begins to learn.  When I talk about training, I mean mentorship.  I mean exactly what the witnesses have said.  One does not have to go into a college and sit there, because that is not how it is done.  It is done with greats, be they photographic greats or director greats.  If I gave the wrong impression there, I just wanted to pull that back.  The witnesses' industry is wonderful and it does give great employment, but because it is creative, it does not have the boundaries into which we can nicely put other areas of employment.  Politics is very interesting because if they do not like us in politics, we will not come back the following day either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00200","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>We will finish on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00300","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>May I respond to Senator O'Donnell's point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Karan O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Very quickly, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22018013100002#N00500","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>It is important that we address the issue of precarity and the working time directive.

In regard to the working time directive, how it operates in the film industry needs to be understood.  The working time directive sets a maximum of 48 working hours in any week, but that is calculated as an average over 17 weeks.  Within the film industry, unless a person is in a long-running production, of which there are not many, the chances of working more than 17 weeks are slim.  A person could be within the parameters of the working time Act while working 55 or 60 hours a week for 10 or 12 weeks.  That is still within the parameters of the working time Act because it is averaged out over 17 weeks.  That is the law, that is the way it is written, and that is the way it is interpreted.  I am not saying it is right, but that is the way it is.<\/p> <p>  That 17 week rolling average can be expanded by agreement.  Agreements can be made to work out that average over a 12 month period.  That is done in other industries where work is cyclical, where people would work six months of the year, for example, picking mushrooms.  They would work intensively for a period of time and then stop.  The problem with the film industry and the working time directive is that if I work 60 hours a week for ten weeks on a production, that is not outside the working time directive.  If I move to another production straight away and work another 60 hours a week for another ten weeks, I am outside the working time directive in the hours I have worked over the 20 weeks, but each of those production companies, considered separately, is not.  That is a problem.  That is the way the legislation is written.  The Government would need to address that in some way to make the industry more compatible with the law.

The NDA was established to provide independent and evidence-informed advice for the Minister on matters of policy and practice relevant to the lives of people with disabilities.  We were given additional functions to operate the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design from 2007.  Our role means that we cover a very wide range of policy areas, Departments and public sector remits.  The statutory Centre for Excellence in Universal Design promotes the universal design of the built environment, products, services and information and communications technology in order that they can be accessed, understood and used independently to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their age, size, ability or disability.  The NDA&rsquo;s view is that a universal design approach to transport would benefit everyone, particularly those with disabilities and older people, especially as it could maximise their participation in society and control over their own lives.<\/p> <p>  Since the NDA was established, transport has been one of the key priority areas identified for attention and focus in our work, with other areas such as employment, for example.  In particular, we have consistently advised that an integrated, planned approach would be required to successfully implement universal access to transport for all.  This would entail joined-up working, involving the different Departments, related agencies and stakeholders working together to provide a co-ordinated policy approach that worked nationally and at local level.  The focus is on the customer&rsquo;s end to end journey.  It requires mainstream policies and services that have been designed to include the needs of persons with disabilities and that have been disability-proofed in line with the Government's commitment to disability mainstreaming.  Our advice is informed by research, learning from good practice and the experiences and views of people with disabilities which we capture in surveys, studies and our consultation exercises.  <\/p> <p>  The NDA has also advised on the broader policy areas of which transport is part which include the built environment, education, employment, health and disability supports.  We advise that there be a focus on accessible transport actions in the strategic plans of Departments and agencies, as well as national strategies and programmes, for example, the current national disability inclusion strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  The NDA produced a code of practice on the accessibility of public services and information.  It has also produced a range of free guidance materials on how to achieve integrated universally designed services.  It has held various seminars and workshops on transport issues that have facilitated discussion and shared learning on how transport services can be more integrated and universally designed for all.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the developments advanced by the Department, the NTA and various agencies and the commitment to continued progress in their strategic plans and national strategies.  The positive developments include increased investment and established plans to address inaccessible transport; an expanded fleet of accessible buses, with a figure of 100% reached in some areas; work being advanced by the NTA to source accessible buses and coaches to address existing challenges for passengers with disabilities; increased investment and an increase in the number of wheelchair accessible vans, WAVs, in the taxi fleet and efforts to continue to expand; rural transport programme developments to support connection with transport solutions; work on a community car scheme to bring customers to transport service locations; continuing work to address the issue of advance notice requirements for services, including rail, even though we appreciate further work is required to address issues in that regard; the roll-out of audiovisual announcements; the development of information solutions for customers; the operation of user groups by transport service providers which should assist in identifying practical solutions to accessibility issues on the ground; and the roll-out of disability awareness training for staff.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, despite positive developments, there are still many people with disabilities who are experiencing barriers in accessing transport.  This needs to be seen as a quality customer service issue rather than as an add-on solution to the problem of disability access.  That entails applying the principles of universal design.  The issues that still need to be addressed include but are not limited to the fact that accessible taxis are not readily available, even in cities where numbers have increased.  Even where accessibility has been advanced, it can break down, unless it is maintained and resourced by trained staff.  Challenges remain in accessing information, as not everyone has a smartphone.  Data systems for each service need to be consistent and inter-operable.<\/p> <p>  Health and safety need to be key considerations.  There is little or no support at stations or on trains, particularly where emergency evacuation is required.  The requirement for advance notice limits people with disabilities in their right to get around.  There are issues with any notice period exceeding 36 hours with reference to EU regulations for coaches.  The reasons there is a need to give notice in advance in some cases we understand arise from technical challenges.  We are pleased that the NTA is working to identify some solutions in that regard.<\/p> <p>  It is crucial that all staff across all public transport services are trained to build awareness and competence.  It should be easier for persons with disabilities to communicate with service providers and easily access complaints procedures.  We note the work to be advanced at bus stops throughout the country.  Some private bus and taxi operators are not providing the same level of accessible transport as their public transport service counterparts.  While audiovisual announcements have improved, they need to be available in all areas.  There is a need for a more robust system to measure and track how accessible public transport services are operating on the ground.<\/p><p>There are safety issues for transport that are also relevant for pedestrians and cyclists, such as challenges navigating Luas tracks.  There is a need for an integrated and accessible ticketing system across services and systems and there are issues concerning the availability of transport for those in disability services.  We welcome the work by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to look at that along with engaging with the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p><p> A key issue is the fact that transport supports are operated by and come within the policies of various Departments and agencies.  There is a need for a more joined-up policy approach to achieve integrated transport services.<\/p><p> The National Disability Authority, NDA, will continue to provide advice to the Department, the NTA and other Departments on the various issues that need to be addressed to ensure the development and operation of an integrated, universally designed public transport service that is responsive to the needs of its customers, including people with disabilities.<\/p><p> We advise cross-departmental working in order to develop a national transport strategy that details how the different Departments and related agencies will work together to deliver an effective, universally designed, integrated public transport service.  We advise the continued and full implementation of actions already committed to in national strategies and that further actions be committed and set out in those strategies which are, in effect, living documents whose implementation is regularly monitored.  It is important that there is buy-in and accountability for those actions throughout the Departments, agencies and service providing bodies within mainstream policy and services and that a universal design approach is adopted, as well as ensuring adherence to new and existing European directives and legislation on accessibility.<\/p><p> The NDA is advancing work to monitor the accessibility of transport services further to research we conducted and a pilot we engaged in recently with the Department, the NTA, service providers and disability stakeholders.  The intention of that project was to identify mechanisms for robust data and a rounded picture on what is happening in services.  We will commence the next stage in monitoring specific transport services this year.  Transport needs to be viewed as a service from the widest perspective, recognising the newer transport solutions emerging, for example, GoCar, and considering how these will be factored into an integrated, universally designed transport service that serves everybody in society and does not reduce mobility for some.  The NDA welcomes the possibility of continued exploration in that regard, being led by the NTA, to identify practical solutions to some of the challenging access issues regarding the overall transport system.  We will continue to play our part in supporting progress through research, advice and guidance.<\/p><p> The NDA considers that accessible transport is key to ensuring equal participation for people with disabilities.  The NDA acknowledges many positive developments but the reality is that many people with disabilities still face barriers on a daily basis.  The NDA recommends that the committed actions detailed in this presentation need to be implemented and, in particular, the action on all key agencies working together to deliver an integrated, universally designed transport system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Barron for a comprehensive and constructive analysis.

I understand the committee wishes to focus upon accessibility of our public transport services.  To assist me in dealing with their subsequent questions I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer with the authority.<\/p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific areas of focus, I would like to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the authority in this provision and regulation of public transport services.  The remit of the NTA is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State to encourage the development and implementation of an integrated accessible transport system within the greater Dublin area and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  This includes the assignment to the authority of the management of the public transport accessibility investment programme.<\/p> <p>  In terms of accessibility of public transport services, they are largely determined by when particular services or infrastructure came into existence.  Accordingly, older public transport infrastructure is largely not accessible or has limited accessibility features. However, more recent infrastructure is designed and built with the needs of disabled users in mind.  The NTA is actively committed to ensuring that new public transport services and infrastructure are fully accessible.  We are committed to securing the retrofitting of all older public transport infrastructure as quickly as resources will allow.<\/p> <p>  As for the current public transport infrastructure, the city bus fleet is now 100% low floor wheelchair accessible and will be maintained so by means of the infrastructure investment programme, with boarding arrangements, seating and internal layout addressing the needs of all passengers.  The fleet purchased in recent years in Dublin has a wheelchair space, as well as a buggy space.  The difficulty on some city services is the availability of the wheelchair space.  The NTA is supporting a multi-agency initiative, launched in October 2017, of a new awareness campaign which highlights the importance of the dedicated wheelchair zone on every Dublin Bus.  The initiative aims to demonstrate the negative consequences that can affect a wheelchair user if they are unable to access the wheelchair zone on Dublin Bus services and encourages commuters to leave the wheelchair zone vacant for those who need it most.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the regional bus fleet, regional bus services are primarily delivered by single-deck or double-deck coaches.  The double-deck coaches are accessible by ramp but require the removal of seats to provide the wheelchair space and the required restraint.  The remaining coach fleet that is accessible uses an external wheelchair lift to lift the passenger onto the high floor of the coach.  Approximately 86% of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s coach fleet is wheelchair accessible.  That percentage will increase as the coach fleet is replaced.  As this fleet requires the removal of seats, 24-hour notice of travel is required.  With regard to bus stops, all city bus stops are fully accessible as they can be served by wheelchair ramp and kneeling suspension on buses.  In regional cities they are wheelchair accessible where there is a hard standing at the stop.  A bus stop that can facilitate the operation of a wheelchair lift from a high-floor coach requires a minimum of 3 m space to the back of the footpath.  Currently, very few bus stops that receive coach services have this space.<\/p> <p>  A number of bus stations are currently accessible but more work is required on some of the key bus stations.  Real-time arrival information is available for each stop on bus and rail services on the web, the smart phone app and SMS messaging service.  Currently, visual and audible next stop announcements are not available on all bus services other than Dublin Bus services.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 10% of public transport services are delivered by commercial operators licensed by the NTA.  In the annual returns we have received from those operators for 2016 services, 16% of the services had low-floor wheelchair accessible vehicles while a further 28% had vehicles with lifts suitable for wheelchair access.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the rural transport programme, those services are operated and managed by the NTA and the 17 LocalLink offices and are largely wheelchair accessible.  LocalLink now provides demand-responsive services under the rural transport programme, which provides a high level of support to the public.  These are door-to-door services that are suitable for those who have a disability and may also have passenger assistance on board.  The NTA has invested in improving the wheelchair lifts on the fleet owned by the rural transport companies.  The current services are being retendered in 2017 and 2018 with a provision that all services must be fully wheelchair-accessible within two years of contract award.<\/p> <p>  All the Luas services have been designed to be fully accessible.<\/p> <p>  As for heavy rail services, all of the fleet operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is fully accessible internally.  The main issue with accessibility for wheelchairs is that a ramp is required between the platform and the carriage and not all rail stations are accessible.  Accordingly, 24 hours' notice of travel must be given currently to ensure access for wheelchair users on all rail services.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has recently introduced a pilot scheme, which results in the notice being reduced to four hours, and a review will be undertaken following the pilot to see how it was received by customers.<\/p> <p>  Of the 144 stations on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network, 118 have received accessibility upgrades or were constructed new to full accessibility standards such that all platforms are accessible, with the remaining 26 stations having one platform accessible.<\/p> <p>  An accessibility audit carried out in 2014 identified 54 stations across the network that require accessibility enhancements.  Since 2015, a number of stations had accessibility enhancement works completed, including Kilcock, Enfield and Maynooth.  Improvements include signage, new footpaths and elimination of steps.  Further works commenced in 2017 on a number of other stations.<\/p> <p>  Installation of a fully accessible lift and associated works at platform 6-7 in Connolly Station, which was identified as one of the major accessibility issues on the rail network, were completed in 2016 and the lift has been fully operational since then.<\/p> <p>  Next stop announcements, both visual and audible, are available on all intercity and commuter rail services.  However, the next stop announcements on the DART service is not up to the required standard and needs replacement.<\/p> <p>  The National Transport Authority continues to support the travel assistance scheme, which is managed by Dublin Bus.<\/p><p>The scheme aims to give people with disabilities confidence to use public transport.  Under the scheme, an assistant can accompany people who need help using public transport and to plan a journey on Dublin Bus, Luas and DART.  Over 1,000 individuals availed of the scheme in 2016 and a total of &euro;200,000 was allocated to the scheme in 2017.<br\/><br\/>The availability of a wheelchair-accessible taxi fleet has been falling in line with the decline in numbers of licensed vehicles and licensed drivers in the industry.  A number of measures have been introduced to increase the number of wheelchair accessible vehicles in the fleet.  Since 2010, the only new vehicle licences issued are for wheelchair-accessible vehicles; new regulations were introduced in 2014 to allow smaller and less-expensive wheelchair-accessible vehicles to operate as taxis and hackneys; and a grant system for wheelchair-accessible vehicles was put in place offering grants of up to &euro;10,000 for the purchase of or conversion to a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, WAV.  The WAV grant scheme has operated from 2014 and the success of the grant scheme is demonstrated by an increase in the number of WAVs in the small public service vehicle fleet from 860 in June 2014 to 1,555 in December 2017, which now represents 7.6% of the total fleet.  One of the conditions attaching to the scheme is that all recipients of the grant must successfully complete a disability awareness training programme, which is provided free of charge by the Irish Wheelchair Association on behalf of the NTA.  There are strict terms and conditions attaching to the WAV grant scheme to ensure that accessible vehicles are used for the intended purpose.  Disability awareness training is provided by all transport operators and disability user groups have been established by all public transport providers.  An accessibility officer has also been appointed across all operators.<br\/><br\/>As that is the current status, what needs to be done?<b><font color=\"#4181C0\"> <\/font><\/b>The funding available in recent years has been considerably constrained, which resulted in difficult choices and prioritisation of projects.  However, the four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost &euro;28 million for the accessibility retrofit programme for the period 2018 to 2021.  This funding is a trebling of the previous allocation for accessibility under the capital plan.  This will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, the upgrading of train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and the grant scheme to support the introduction of more wheelchair-accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet and many of the projects I intend to outline.<br\/><br\/>As for the bus fleet, the high-floor coaches currently available do not offer a good customer experience to wheelchair users.  There does not seem to be many alternatives to this type of fleet for long distance inter-urban services.  Together with Bus &Eacute;ireann, we propose a change in our fleet strategy for shorter regional commuter services of less than 50 km.  In future, these services could be operated by low-floor single-deck vehicles, rather than high-floor coaches.  We are in the process of procuring the first of these vehicles with a low-floor ramp entry suitable for the mobility impaired with a dedicated wheelchair space and we expect them to be in service from 2019.  With regard to commercial public transport services, now that the NTA has more knowledge of the fleet available to the Irish market,<b><font color=\"#424282\"><\/font><\/b>the authority will move to regulate the accessibility of the public transport services operated by commercial operators.  The authority will publish its proposals in this area later this year, which will set out minimum accessibility standards for fleets operating public transport services for new licences and on renewal of existing licences.<br\/><br\/>The authority is looking at ways to improve the journey information available to disabled users.  The national journey planner features a wheelchair symbol for transport services that are known to be accessible.  The authority is also looking into providing information on options for a step-free journey on the journey planner.  This requires an audit of bus stops and other public transport infrastructure to determine their level of accessibility and this work is under way.  The authority is in the process of standardising names of stops, which will be disseminated across all bus services.  This will allow next-stop announcements to be made where the facility is available on the bus.  Retrofitting of visual screens will be undertaken as required for the visual next-stop announcements.<br\/><br\/>In 2013, a comprehensive estimate of the cost of addressing accessibility issues at the various Bus &Eacute;ireann bus stations was prepared.  Excluding three particular stations - Bus&aacute;ras, Ceannt Station, Galway and Colbert Station, Limerick - the cost of addressing accessibility issues at the other bus stations was estimated at &euro;11.5 million.  Separate larger redevelopment plans have been prepared for Colbert Station, Limerick and Ceannt Station, Galway, both of which are shared bus and rail stations and these will include compliance with all accessibility standards as part of those redevelopments.  The authority will work with Bus &Eacute;ireann and CI&Eacute; to ensure that a comprehensive programme of upgrading bus stations continues.  Access to railway station buildings and platforms remains challenging at some locations.  The authority will continue to fund accessibility upgrades at stations as funding allows.<br\/><br\/>With respect to bus stops for high-floor coach services, as I indicated, the wheelchair arrangements for high-floor vehicles require a large area of adjacent footpath to operate, typically between 3 m and 3.5 m in width.  In many towns and villages, it is extremely challenging to achieve the necessary footpath width for the vehicle lift to function.  Solutions such as relocating the bus stop to an alternative location may be necessary but this can give rise to additional problems, in that the alternative stop location may not suit other users.  In other cases land or property acquisition may be required to obtain the necessary space, potentially requiring the exercise of compulsory acquisition powers to acquire the relevant lands.  As a result of the complexity of determining the solution in each case and the need for extensive consultation with various parties, we do not have a singular figure for making all coach stops capable of accommodating wheelchair lifts on coaches.  However, we will continue to upgrade the bus stops, where possible, to ensure that all main towns have at least one wheelchair lift-accessible bus stop in each direction.<br\/><br\/>With regard to taxis and hackneys, the NTA will continue to offer a WAV grant as long as funding is available to achieve a minimum of 10% of WAVs in the fleet by 2020.  The DART fleet requires an upgrade of its next-stop announcements.  In general, the communications to passengers on board the trains and particularly in stations needs to be improved.  An upgrade of the on-board and at-station communications systems is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;30 million.  Work will commence shortly on scoping this project.<br\/><br\/>The authority is looking at the legislative changes required to allow the operators' by-laws to be changed to allow enforcement of priority for wheelchair users.  Whereas much has been done to raise the level of accessibility across our public transport services, I acknowledge there is still work to do.  Some of that work is challenging but the NTA is committed to meeting that challenge in partnership with our operating companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham for that comprehensive address to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#F00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank both groups for their informative submissions.

We consider the transport service in that context.  As part of that we are researching a monitoring mechanism to roll out the focus for a detailed analysis of what is happening in the transport area.  We started that with research on the kind of tools and mechanisms that would be effective for measuring accessibility.  Other jurisdictions struggle with how to ensure strong, clear, concrete standards to measure accessibility.  There is very poor quality data, and differing data from service providers.  We considered trialling a system and self-assessment questionnaires, we did mystery shopping and customer satisfaction surveys and we analysed performance measurement systems.<\/p> <p>  We worked very closely with the NTA, the Department and the public service providers and disability stakeholders to try to devise something that would be workable and would give the quality information required.

The challenge is outside the cities and we have an issue with the fleet and bus stop infrastructure and information.  There is a very low level of accessibility outside the city areas.<\/p> <p>  We receive a separate budget of &euro;28 million for the next four years from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the disability programme to improve and retrofit the infrastructure.  That will go into the type of works I indicated earlier.  I could not give a timeframe for getting all our services 100% accessible.  It depends on the level of funding available, on some changes we hope to see in the fleet, and working together with our agencies and operators to deliver the infrastructure on the ground.  There are definitely challenges in all that and I would not be able to give a timeframe.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked about the bus fleet.  Before now all the services outside Dublin were operated by a coach fleet, which is a high floor coach.  We have moved and changed our strategy so that the shorter journeys outside our cities will be operated by low floor vehicles, with a dedicated wheelchair space.  That is a change in approach to the fleet.  There would be no requirement for notice in respect of the fleet but we have to make sure there are accessible bus stops to serve that type of fleet.  The challenge is the inter-city, the longer journey fleet which usually operates with a higher floor because that level of comfort is needed for the long distance journeys.  We want to move away from the 24-hour notice.  We would like to have no notice period associated with public transport services.  We are moving incrementally by considering the short journeys initially, removing the requirement for notice on the basis that we have a low floor fleet available with the right bus stop infrastructure.  <\/p> <p>  We are undertaking the audit of bus stops.  We had done a lower level audit.  Using much of the framework from the NTA we are assessing those in much more detail to see what level of accessibility we can give to the infrastructure we have.  That will identify the work that needs to be done to have them considered 100% accessible, which feeds into the information we give on the journeys that can be made, through our journey planner.  That work is under way and we expect to complete it in the next few months, which will also help our work programme on bus stops in particular.<\/p><p> The information that I gave on the private operators - the licensed commercial operators - refers to the services that are operated privately.  That is the public transport services that are licensed by us, not tendered by us.  When we go to tender services, and we do use commercial operators to provide services for us, we have moved and are moving towards requiring that the fleet they operate is wheelchair accessible, and preferably low-floor wheelchair accessible, particularly for the shorter journeys.  <\/p><p> In terms of rural transport services, we allowed a short lead-in term of two years for those services.  That means if the service is not wheelchair accessible, now that we have awarded them the contract, they have two years to get their fleet in place to offer wheelchair access.  If they do not comply then we re-tender the service and remove the service from them.  We are moving slowing to improve and move as much as possible towards a low-floor accessible fleet that does not require notice, and that does not require the removal of seats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I would like a clarification.

I am concerned about the suggestion that there should be buy-in by various Departments.  I wish to make the point that they should automatically do so.<\/p> <p>  I want to refer to wheelchair accessible taxis.  I received a reply from the National Transport Authority in the past few weeks.  I accept that there is a grant scheme.  The grant and the changes made in 2014 have been helpful.  The number of such taxis per head of population varies very significantly.  For example, Tipperary is the worst with just one wheelchair accessible taxi for every 28,000 people.  By contrast, Dublin has one wheelchair accessible taxi for every 2,000 people.<\/p> <p>  In terms of growing the fleet by 10%, it matters where the 10% is located because disability is not something that is unique to one location.  Has a more targeted approach been proposed for areas where very significant deficiencies in the service has shown up?  How can one ensure there is a universal spread in terms of a service if one does not implement a targeted approach, as well as grow the number?  I presume the 10% is a target.  It would be nice if that target was exceeded. <\/p> <p>  I would like to hear more about the measurement of outcomes.  If one does not have a plan there will be no outcomes and one cannot see if progress has been made.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Graham mentioned that providers are given two years to move towards providing an accessible service.  Are there situations where there is an accessible service but when the NTA moved to a tender process the service disimproved only to improve again in two years' time?  Would that be something the NTA would not permit?  We do not want the service to go backwards and forwards.  If there is a fully accessible fleet then there should be a comparable competitive tender.  I mean the competitive tender should be like with like.<\/p><p>Could the witness give an indication of the costs for retrofitting older public transport or if any work has been done on that?  It would be useful for us to have that in our report.  For example, is it possible to retrofit the rail services with automatic ramps?  With regard to bus stops, does the National Transport Authority have a plan and then require the local authorities, if the local authorities are involved at all, to implement the plan?  How is that carried out?  What we do not want is a very enthusiastic local authority using all the money and it not being in the worst part of the country.  It should have a reasonable spread.  There is a &euro;30 million scoping project relating to DART for the announcements and the visual upgrades.  Is there a timeline for it being implemented?  Does it all have to be implemented at the same time or does Ms Graham have information on that?<\/p><p> Ms Graham referred to compulsory acquisition powers with regard to bus stops.  How advanced is the authority on being clear about what it is seeking, and is there buy-in from the Department to include that in legislation?  Where is the engagement on that?  In terms of the legislative changes regarding the use of the section on the bus, what is the position with that?  When might we see that appearing in either primary or secondary legislation, if that is necessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#H01900","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for giving me the opportunity to speak.  He is under pressure too.  I was a member of the board of the National Disability Authority for a number of years.  We received welcome news from the Government yesterday on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I draw people's attention to Article 9 on accessibility to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, including information and communication technologies, and so forth.  It refers to both urban and rural.  The rural conundrum has been mentioned already.  We will ratify the convention in a month or two.  I believe the work the committee has been doing already in the space around accessibility puts one in a good place to drive and keep that theme.  We have had meetings with people with disabilities as witnesses and participants.  It gives an edge to the proceedings.  It is a different environment from the one we are in today, but we are all committed to the same thing.  Getting things moved forward means nothing to somebody with a disability who cannot depend on a service today.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ms Barron's presentation, it is unfair but I will try to distil it down to where we are and what needs to happen.  She made a few key statements.  She referred to the various Departments and agencies involved.  This theme is in the remit of the National Transport Authority as well.  She said the NDA advises cross-departmental working and she referred to the importance of getting full implementation of all the actions already agreed.  There is a gap between action and moving it to execution.  How big a boost would it be to this project if the various Departments and entities, and this encompasses local authorities, transport, private operators and others, were to work together in a more coherent and determined way?  With ratification of the convention approaching, getting folk together in a determined way across the different silos in which they normally work would be important.  Transport accessibility is key to a range of other things.  We do not need to labour that other than to mention training, employment and other services.  Does she have a view on that?<\/p> <p>  Due to the time constraints I will move to Ms Graham's presentation.  I thank her for it and for the work the authority is doing.  She said when replying to a question that we have a low level of accessibility outside the cities.  It is helpful to say that in simple language.  That is the case not just for people with disabilities but also for older people and people who live outside the big cities.  We should remember that.  Giving 24 hours notice does not mean that it works.  Two of the five wheelchair users who turned up for the pilot presentation about the four hour scheme for the DART on Monday could not get there or could not get home.<\/p> <p>  There is another question.  It is not a tricky question but it is not a two plus two equals four question.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked how long more it will take and Ms Graham said that depends on how much comes out of the State's pocket.  Ms Graham might not be able to answer this question but it would be useful if she could advise the committee on it.  Given the trend that has been in place over the last number of years and the amount of money that has been available to deal with the accessibility project, how long would it take if that was the continuing trend?  She might have footnotes to that because she might say there is an indication that it will be improved or whatever, but taking the baseline that we keep going at the current level, in what year and century will this be sorted?  That would be useful for us.<\/p> <p>  I have a similar question for the NTA to the one I put to the NDA.  The NTA has a remit to develop the provision of integrated public transport services and integrated accessible transport systems within the Dublin area.  What are the different stakeholders that have to be involved, such as local authorities and so forth?  Again, could we pump up the work by the different agencies?  I have a range of other questions but I will not ask them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#J00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will thank you for not asking them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#J00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>We can return to them.

Our guests' contribution is very important for us.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make some fundamental points.  First, I tried to imagine myself in a wheelchair.  Can people try to do that?  I live in Connemara.  It is not a matter of me simply sitting into the car, driving to Dublin, going to meetings, staying in a hotel and so forth.  I am not able to imagine it.  I do not thing any of us can put ourselves in that situation.  It is not anybody's intention but I believe we are treating part of our community as second class citizens.  We should start from there.<\/p> <p>  I have a little involvement in this area.<\/p><p>I am a patron of Ability West and the Irish Association of Supported Employment, IASE.  The term \"disability\" does not sit right with me because I know several people to whom it is applied who have significantly more ability than I and many others do.  They are incredibly talented individuals with many abilities.  If we accept that as a framework and try to put ourselves into the shoes of such people, we might be able to begin to imagine some of the challenges they face.<\/p><p> What the committee is trying to do in this regard is probably the most important thing it might achieve and it needs a clear structure, strategy and key performance indicators, KPIs.  What are the witnesses' organisations hoping to achieve?  I am very respectful of them and appreciate that they are doing their best.  What are they trying to achieve, by what time, how much will it cost and what are the challenges?  I found the presentations very useful and perhaps they had to be somewhat general.  Towards the end of her presentation, Ms Graham began to get more specific, which I appreciate.  Perhaps it is because I come from a business background but I wish to know what is to be done, when, by whom and what the key deliverables and challenges are.  If those facts are available for the committee to study, interrogate in a positive way and begin using in our deliberations it will give significant meat to what we are trying to achieve.  We need the witnesses' help in that regard.<\/p><p> The issue regarding urban and rural as raised by other members is very important.  We must do our best to have balance.  Imagine if one were trying to go from A to B and had to give 24 hours' notice before travelling.  It would not be easy.  I appreciate that the witnesses are doing their best.  This issue must be pushed as a very high priority.  It is very important to have KPIs and a business plan and to know what is to be delivered, when, by whom, how much it will cost and what the challenges are.  I would value the witnesses' comments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#J00500","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I was in Cuba a few years ago and everybody had to give 24 hours' notice to use public transport.

Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh fairly summed the issue up a moment ago.  At our first meeting on this issue, witnesses with limited mobility appeared before the committee to share their experiences of using public transport.  Those experiences were less than flattering in some cases, although some positive experiences were also shared.  However, the positive experiences shared were the result of the goodwill of key people working on behalf of the transport companies.  That should not be the case.  It should not be about who one meets when one turns up at a DART, train or bus station.<\/p> <p>  We must set key targets for what we want to achieve, by when and how that will be done.  Without knowing exactly where one wants to go and the timeframe for getting there, one is unable to put a plan in place.  The reduction to four hours of the notice required for usage of the DART by persons with limited mobility has recently been rolled out.  Although a reduction from 24 to four hours' notice would normally be welcome, the service users were far from complimentary of the measure.

On outcomes and outcome indicators, a large part of our role in the National Disability Authority is to measure the outcomes and impacts of policies as well as their outputs.  Strategies such as the national disability strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy factor in specific timeframes, targets and responsibilities.  They are sometimes a little loose in terms of an exact timeframe and an activity may be described as ongoing but even in such a case we measure it against what is happening.  The National Disability Authority produces an assessment report, usually on an annual basis, for the relevant monitoring committees for the national disability strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy.  We recently submitted an analysis to the latter committee.  That is one form of analysis but it can tend to measure outputs.<\/p> <p>  Overall outcomes involve measuring the difference an action has made in the lives of those with disabilities.  One can provide more accessible buses on a route but if people do not use them to travel, it does not make much of a difference in their lives.  Our role is also to consider how that can be monitored at the higher level of outcomes.  We often have to rely on data reported overall from the Central Statistics Office because such data is robust and collected at frequent intervals, which means it can be measured over a period of time.  However, that can also impact the frequency at which one can measure such outcomes.<\/p> <p>  Along with the HSE, we have devised a monitoring framework specific to disability services and the supports in that regard.  It is built on an area of nine outcomes and the impact on people's lives in terms of living in the community, friendships, being able to get out and about and how one measures that at a personal level as well as overall.  That is a work in progress in terms of how it will be implemented and transport will be a key aspect thereof.<\/p> <p>  There is a challenge in terms of the quality of data when measuring outcomes at the highest level because people measure and report different things.  Different organisations are measuring apples and oranges.  One is very reliant on a very good data source, which is dependent on the questions asked, what is recorded and how the information is categorised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Barron"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>It would be useful to know, in the context of the committee's report, whether there is a way to get a similarity in approach such that people are talking about the same things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#K00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>There is such a way in regard to transport.  One of the issues we considered as part of monitoring the transport service was looking at getting information from a range of sources but founded on very clear criteria.  We will be working with the National Transport Authority on devising those criteria for measuring accessibility.  That information will also come from how complaints are recorded.  There was mention of transparency, which will help identify issues and the number of incidents.  There is no reason for service providers not to undertake regular customer surveys because customer service is the issue for everybody, including those with disabilities.<\/p><p>The findings on that could be published and could inform further improvements.  There is further work to be done in the context of indicators.  In looking internationally at what might constitute effective measurement tools, it is something that is quite challenging.  We are working with DIT and engaging with Trinity College in respect of data analytics and good systems for improving that.  We are continuing to bring that to bear in terms of monitoring transport and other policy areas.  I hope that is okay.<\/p><p> I will now address the questions from Senator Dolan regarding what needed to happen overall in terms of getting bodies to work together.  One of the challenges is that there are lots of good initiatives but they are happening in isolation.  They are being funded by different Departments and agencies.  They are not connected.  There is an issue around someone's journey from A to B.  People may have to use different transport means.  They need lots of information about that, reliability of timetables and certainty that there will be a connection between that and that they can easily access it in a most convenient way.  It is not just about getting out to a social life.  It is obviously critical to employment, education and other things people want to do.  While we welcome the fact that transport is a core element of strategies like the comprehensive employment strategy and the national disability strategy, there is a need to look at transport in the round in the context of all those different Departments and how that all joins up and works together, how funding can be more effectively used and how those services can be better linked.<\/p><p> Going back to the question about outcome indicators, there are lots of data.  It is a matter of bringing all of that together and using it to better effect.  Bringing all of that together and capturing it in some kind of overall strategy with timeframes and indicators would lend itself to measuring this more easily over time but, in particular, to measuring our report to the UN committee in terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and how we are advancing the issues relating to that.  Many of those issues are captured in the national disability strategy and other frameworks to a degree but a lot more can be done to achieve a joined-up approach across agencies and in respect of sharing of data.  There is the question of rural-urban issues, the taxi service and the standards that can apply.  It also means that they would all be measured in the same way as well.  We feel there is a need to bring Departments and agencies together to create some kind of transport for all plan and looking at it from a universal design approach so it is not, as I said earlier, about an add-on service.  It is about a service for everybody, including people with disabilities, and a good customer service from which everybody benefits.<\/p><p> I think a lot of the points were made equally about clear structures and strategies and indicators, which would be part of that; a better way of monitoring accessibility, going back to the points made earlier about a similar way of reporting; the criteria people are measuring against; the different means of gathering data from sources, particularly from customers themselves; and who is charge of that.  We have a key role in monitoring the success of policies, programmes and strategies so one could say we are guiding on the monitoring systems and devising that.  We are monitoring what is there in a sense but it is very much built on the information that is available to us and our awareness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobhan Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>In respect of driving that change, there could be a website or somewhere people could go to make complaints if they wanted to do so.

Obviously, it would not be our intention for the service to disimprove.  The tender process is not based on price alone, but we also look at quality, and one of the quality elements is the accessibility which is offered.  I am not aware of any disimprovements in the service level and it would not be our intention that this would happen.  Even if it occurred as a result of a pricing issue, because a tender process is being undertaken, we would try to recover that as quickly as possible, with the two years requirement to have a wheelchair accessible vehicle on the service.  As I said, I am not aware of anything that has happened in that case.<\/p> <p>  On the next stop announcements on the DART, we had some indication and there has been some scoping work done with an initial costing of &euro;30 million put on that.

If we need to step in, we have the facility to do that.  When we did the work with the Irish Wheelchair Association on access to the wheelchair space on Dublin Bus, one issue that Dublin Bus raised with us is that its drivers cannot force people out of the space.  They can only encourage them.  Its by-laws and the primary legislation does not allow them to enforce a movement.

We will give the committee a note of what would be required for the areas that we would target and the type of infrastructure that we would prioritise to make significant steps towards that target.  We supplied the committee with information which gives an indication of the cost relating to railway stations, where the improvements would cost around &euro;80 million.  Regarding bus stations, Bus &Eacute;ireann wants to revisit the cost associated with it, but in that case improving the infrastructure would also be in the tens of millions.

We know that as a result of that, there are issues when someone who needs assistance wants to travel.  That is why the 24 hour notice is required.  There is a trade-off between notice required and the level of service that is available and the cost associated with the level of service of having a manned station.  It is something that we will work with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to establish the best level of service where passengers need assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#M01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1517405400,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Are there any further questions or do the witnesses wish to make any further comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018013100002#M01600","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517405400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I apologise for having missed a question earlier regarding the implications of EU regulations and the various directives.  I want to highlight the fact that further obligations are coming down the track in terms of a web directive and also an EU accessibility act.  The implications of those are that we will have to have better systems for planning, achieving and measuring the impact of what we are doing to realise those requirements progressively.<\/p><p>It is about how that is measured at national level but also how it is measured within the relevant sector.  That comes in under a particular Department, for example, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and it should be very much a strong feature of its strategic corporate plan and in how it measures and accounts for its performance as a Department and sector.  How it feeds back in to reporting must also be considered, and how Ireland is performing and reporting back in to the EU systems.<\/p><p> We are always happy to support and guide on how this might happen.  We will conduct our own independent assessment also.  A lot more work, however, is needed to improve data, data sources, criteria that are used and the very specific timeframes and indicators that will apply.
