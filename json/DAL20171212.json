It is not, as some speakers have claimed, an attack on rural or urban life or any group of persons.  The purpose of the proposals is to make our roads safer for us all.  Whether one is driving in west Kerry or north Louth, the same rules apply.  As it stands, it is against the law to drive with a blood alcohol level above 50 mg per 100 ml.  Where the level is between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml, the motorist will, on conviction, have penalty points imposed on his or her licence.  This Bill proposes not to change the amount of alcohol motorists may have in their system but to change the penalty for the offence in question such that there will, for a first offence, be an automatic disqualification from driving for three months.<\/p>  <p>  The question is whether this provision is reasonable and right and, if so, what argument can we make to sustain that position.  Road death statistics last year show that, sadly, seven people were killed in County Kerry, which is the same number as died in County Louth.  Those two counties are quite different.  Louth is the smallest county in the State but has a large urban population and a huge volume of traffic and a motorway running through it.  Kerry is a much larger county with an entirely different geography, road network and spread of population.  Unfortunately, we saw the same number of deaths on the roads in the two counties in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Studies carried out by the Road Safety Authority show that over a period of years, an average of seven motorists driving with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml die on our roads every year.<\/p><p>Consider if the people who died in Kerry last year had not died and were saved, or if the seven people who died in Louth had been saved.  That is what we must measure by, but we are measuring by the lives that are being saved against the disadvantage, or the perceived disadvantage, of the regulation.  Is it better to save lives?  The answer, clearly and absolutely, is \"Yes\".<\/p> <p> I live in County Louth and the regulation affects the drivers in my county as much as it affects people anywhere else.  Sadly, more than 12 people have lost their lives on the roads in County Louth to date this year.  This is very sad and it is unacceptable.  Anything we can do to save lives should be done, and we must do it.  This is why I believe this legislation is important and that Deputies should support its passage.<\/p> <p> As I said in an earlier contribution, in County Louth in November during the world day of remembrance for road traffic victims, more than 600 people attended our local church.  They lit candles for the family members they had lost through road traffic accidents in the previous year.  Sadly, that list grows every year.  I am happy that my vote will be used in the D&aacute;il - whenever the vote is called - to do our very best to reduce that death and carnage on our roads.<\/p> <p> The question arises about travel.  If a person lives in a rural area, he or she has further to travel for their recreation, be it a pub or whatever.  What assistance is proposed for people who live in disparate, distant rural areas where population is low density and in more remote areas where people are clearly isolated?  I believe the proposal for the rural link transport network, which is activated currently during the day, to be made available at certain times at night and at weekends is a socially positive policy.  It makes sense that we help people in rural areas to travel in the evening and at night.  If it means that more people can go out using public transport in the evening or at night, I do not have a problem with that, especially in areas where people would not otherwise have an opportunity to travel because of the remoteness of where they live.  This proposal is excellent and I fully support it.<\/p> <p> The issues that arise as a result of people going to court was widely broadcast last night on \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\".  When people are brought to court, it is quite shocking that only 48% of those charged with exceeding the blood alcohol level actually get a conviction.  I welcome the work done by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, in meeting with the Attorney General to look at the way the courts deal with the huge volume of business they have to process.  In the past year, for example, 382,000 criminal offences, 134,000 civil cases and 36,000 family law cases were brought before the courts.  The courts also had to deal with some 60,000 fines and a total of 284 District Court orders were made.  A huge volume of work is going through our Courts Service.  I welcome the fact that funding for the Courts Service has increased by &euro;20 million this year to bring it to a total of &euro;132 million.<\/p> <p> Within that context, there are disparate policies in respect of sentencing, specifically for drink driving.  On last might's RT&Eacute; programme, we found out the statistics that are available by District Court number.  We can see why some areas have a much higher rate of convictions for drink driving than other areas.  I do not believe that this disparity or difference is acceptable to the public.  I understand that 60% of business going through our District Courts is road traffic related.  Obviously they are not all drink-driving cases.<\/p><p>We need to ensure that the Judicial Council Bill, which was introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the Seanad on 22 November, deals with reform of our independent judiciary, will promote excellence, investigate complaints and establish greater accountability from our judicial colleagues.  I will not be critical of any judge, which would be improper and it is not the role of a politician to become directly involved in these matters.  However, it is our role to ensure judges have continuing education and training and that there is proper sentencing across the country.  One issue which we examined last night was that of the poor box.  There are places such as Roscommon where the total contribution to the poor box last year was &euro;200, whereas in the wonderful county of Kerry it was &euro;384,000. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200004#D00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513080900,"counter":10,"content":"<p>We have a wonderful county as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200006#F00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1513080900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is wrong that there should be such a huge disparity.  Those counties are the two extremes, with most counties in between.  If it is mandatory that someone gets penalty points for speeding or other offences, it is wrong that the poor box is used by a judge when he or she is not allowed to do so.  I ask the Minister that when the next case comes to his attention, it is appealed to the High Court and it should be overturned.  That would be an example of immediate action by the Minister to ensure that the law applies fairly and universally to everybody.  It is very important that we increase public confidence in our judicial system and in our courts system.  I welcome that under the Judicial Council Bill there can be informal or formal inquiries and that not only judges but also lay people will sit on them.<\/p>  <p>  The issue around drunk driving is exceptionally clear.  I understand the feelings of people in rural areas and the initiative that hopefully the Government will take regarding Rural Link, but ultimately when one sits behind the wheel of one's car, one has to be able to say that one does not have alcohol in one's system, which is a good and positive thing, but one also wants to make sure that the person coming towards the car from the other direction does not have alcohol on him or her either.  The only way of ensuring that is by a strict legislative code, which is there.  It has been proven that the number of road deaths is falling as a result of our activity against drunken driving.  It is good, proper and right that this legislation passes.  Anyone can have an accident but I would hate to think that I would be responsible for someone being injured by my car if I had drink on me, even if it was only one drink.  I would find it very hard to forgive myself, if I had a choice to drink or not to drink, or to drive or not to drive.  The only message we should give is that one cannot drink and drive.  Even a small amount of alcohol does affect people according to research conducted in Ireland and internationally.  For safer, better, more effective driving, we must do this.<\/p>  <p>  I am also very concerned that our roads are fit for purpose.  I would be concerned if there was any reduction in the moneys made available for the improvement of road junctions and road maintenance.  Our secondary roads and small rural roads need much more attention than they often receive.  Sadly, we have too many dangerous corners and junctions which continue to cause problems with accidents and sometimes deaths.  We must have policies not only regarding the levels of alcohol when driving but also of improving road safety and increasing investment in our rural road network.  I constantly receive complaints in my county regarding jobs that need to be done.  The council will say it does not have the money and is unable to do it.<\/p>  <p>  I support this legislation.  The Minister is acting wisely.<\/p><p>The Road Safety Authority has done its work well.  It acts impartially and the research it produces does not just apply in Ireland - it has a universal application.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that this legislation causes difficulties for some people but the efforts to improve public transport links, particularly in remote rural areas, are very welcome.  Fewer people will die on our roads this year and saving lives is the only game in town - everything else is secondary to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200006#F00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513081200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Eugene Murphy.  I have listened to the statistics given by Members on the Government benches but, as a former Taoiseach once said, one can prove anything one likes with statistics.  The Government just does not understand how rural Ireland operates or the damage it is going to do to rural Ireland.  No one condones drunk driving and I will not stand in this Chamber and say anyone should get behind the wheel of a car when drunk.  However, the changes the Government is making to legislation will make it impossible for people to go to a rural pub which, in an awful lot of cases, is their only social outlet.  They have to get behind the wheel of a car to go to work the morning after but the new focus on testing in the morning time will make it impossible for them to do so.<\/p><p>I enjoy a game of cards and I enjoy the social aspect of pubs in rural areas and rural towns.  There is great craic in playing a game of 25, which is described by the <i>Oxford Dictionary<\/i>as a game played by the peasant Irish.  I have enjoyed playing it for long hours in country pubs but, unfortunately, that social fabric is becoming a thing of the past.  This legislation will cause rural isolation and social isolation of this nature causes mental issues.  The legislation will send tremors down the backs of people who enjoy one or two drinks in their local hostelry.  If there is no company when one goes into a local pub it is a waste of time but that is what is happening in rural pubs.  They are closing in huge numbers and rural publicans now say it is not worth their while opening on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday night.  That is a cancer because if one goes to a pub and there is nobody there, one will not go again the next night.<\/p><p>We are not here to discuss mental health services but this will cause immense mental health issues and I represent a county where no psychiatric bed is available at this moment.  We have no Luas in rural Ireland, no taxis, no buses passing the door, no DART and no train service.  Even in provincial towns you will not, most nights of the week, get a taxi to take you home.  Last night I was at a cumann meeting in a pub in my home town of Thurles.  When I came downstairs at 10.30 p.m. there were two people in the pub and this is two weeks before Christmas.  I went out to go home at the same time and the town was deserted.  There is a taxi rank outside the door but there was no taxi and one would not get one at that time as it is not economic for taxis to operate.<\/p><p>The Minister represents south County Dublin and he does not understand what this legislation will do to rural Ireland.<\/p><p>I am very disappointed with rural Deputies on the Government side who have not got the message through to the Minister on the damage and depredation this will do.  This legislation will compound an already extremely difficult situation.  The social structure in rural communities is under major pressure.  This legislation will be the final nail in the coffin of rural areas and rural towns.  It will destroy a social fabric we have had for generations.  The current legislation makes it illegal for people to drink more than certain prohibited limits.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced mandatory testing and supported legislation which decreased the alcohol limit to one of the lowest in Europe.  This is a point on which we need to have some emphasis.<\/p> <p> The latest proposal from the Minister, Deputy Ross, is to introduce automatic disqualification for three months for those found driving with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg.  Automatic disqualification for a person in rural Ireland in most cases means the loss of their employment also.  At present, this offence is punishable by three penalty points provided the driver is not a learner or a professional driver and has not been found guilty of the same offence within the previous three years.  The Minister is portraying the Bill as a catch-all Bill that would prevent more people from drinking and driving.  As I said at the outset, no one condones drink-driving, but in our view if the existing legislation was properly enforced, it would be more than adequate.<\/p> <p> There needs to be stronger enforcement of existing laws as well as ways to address the full range of causes of deaths on roads.  Research confirms that drivers with a blood alcohol content of between 51 mg and 80 mg make up a very small proportion of the number of fatal collisions.  Obviously, none of us want to see any fatal collision.  Even one is too many.  A report by the RSA on the years from 2008 to 2012 showed 4.6% of cases involved a level of alcohol.  Overall, only 11% of cases cited alcohol as a contributory factor.  In half of the cases covered in the report, drivers had a blood alcohol content of more than 200 mg per 100 ml, which is four times the legal limit.<\/p> <p> Education and enforcement of existing laws combined is where progress on the issue can be made.  In this regard, Ireland is a long way behind.  We do not have a mandatory module in schools on the dangers of drink-driving, despite the fact a disproportionate number of fatal collisions involving alcohol involve drivers under the age of 25.  In 44% of cases in the RSA report, drivers were not wearing seatbelts, highlighting the need for stronger enforcement and awareness.  The Government has proposals on increasing the number of Garda checkpoints.  Given the recent breathalyser test issue, the public needs to know the Government is serious about a Garda presence on our roads to prevent and detect drink-driving and decrease speeding, which is a major contributory factor in collisions.<\/p> <p> Most fatal collisions where alcohol is a contributory factor involved drivers whose blood alcohol level is higher than 100 mg.  These drivers should face much higher sanctions.  Evidence suggests that closing these loopholes and strengthening provisions would be a far more effective means of saving lives.  We propose the current penalty points sanction be increased from three to five and that the fine be doubled to &euro;500.  We also support increasing penalties for those found driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of 100 mg, as these drivers are responsible for eight out of ten fatal road collisions involving alcohol.  We also support increasing penalties for those breaking a driving disqualification who account for approximately one fifth of fatal road collisions.<\/p> <p> Clearly, we need to do more to reduce the incidence of drink-driving on our roads.  Increasing the number of garda&iacute; doing checkpoints must be part of this.  The real issue is those who are well over the legal limit of 50 mg.  In the in-depth study conducted by the RSA on the role of alcohol in fatal collisions between 2008 and 2012, it found alcohol was a factor in approximately 29% of fatal collisions.  In eight of out ten of these cases, the blood alcohol content was more than 100 mg per 100 ml.  In five out of ten cases, the blood alcohol level was more than 200 mg per 100 ml.<\/p><p>These are the drivers the Minister must pursue if he really wishes to reduce the number of people killed on our roads.  Our penalties for driving with blood alcohol levels above 100 mg are low compared with those in the rest of Europe.<\/p> <p> At present, a condition for a learner driver permit is that the driver must be accompanied by a qualified driver.  When a learner driver is identified as unaccompanied, he or she will receive, in the first instance, a fixed charge notice with a fine of &euro;80 and two penalty points.  If the learner driver does not pay the fixed charge and is subsequently convicted in court, he or she faces a fine of &euro;2,000 for a first offence, &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence and &euro;2,000 and up to three months in prison for a third or subsequent offence within a 12-month period.  He or she will also receive four penalty points.  In December 2016, the Road Traffic Act was amended to make it an offence for the owner of a car to allow a learner driver to drive his or her car without a qualified driver present.  The Minister is now seeking to commence this part of the Act under the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017, which we will support.  Of 100 fatalities on Irish roads up to October 2017, 13 were learner drivers and 11 of them were unaccompanied.  Over the five years of 2012 to 2016, an average of 30 learner drivers were involved in serious or fatal road collisions.  Unfortunately, 42 of these were fatal road crashes.<\/p> <p> There are many reasons for fatal crashes on our roads.  Putting people who are found to have blood alcohol levels of between 50 mg and 80 mg off the road will not reduce the number of fatal crashes on roads, but it will destroy the social fabric of rural Ireland.  As I said, nobody wishes to see a fatal road crash.  Arriving at the scene of a serious crash is something that lives with a person for a long time.  However, the Minister is not taking the correct route.  This will do untold damage to the social fabric of rural Ireland.  The mental health issues that will arise after its enactment are immense.  Unfortunately, when we lose that rural social fabric, it will be gone for ever.  I plead with the Government to think carefully about the damage this legislation will do to rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200007#G00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513081800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Deputy Cahill has said most of what I wished to say.  I wish to make it clear, and this point has been missed by many, that Fianna F&aacute;il has always taken a strong line on drink-driving.  As my colleague said, we introduced mandatory testing and supported the legislation that decreased the blood alcohol limit to one of the lowest in Europe.  When I hear some people say that Fianna F&aacute;il will not support legislation because it is in the hands of the publicans or that we are weak on this issue and do not wish to get involved in this debate in case it would annoy publicans and so forth, they could not be further from the truth.<\/p>  <p>  I will describe the lobbying in my constituency.  Two publicans mentioned this issue to me, and the Minister will be aware that I represent a very big constituency.  I have known one of the publicans all of his life.  Either he or members of his family always brought people home at night if they thought they were even one sip over the limit.  That point has been forgotten.  In many respects, rural publicans looked after their customers in a significant way.  I worked in my cousin's bar when I was a youngster.  The policy at that time, which is a number of years ago and before there was any legislation such as this, was to get people home safely at night and to take their car keys from them where that was necessary.  I saw that happen on many occasions.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is a huge issue for the fabric of society in rural Ireland.  The Minister should examine the drinking habits in rural areas and compare them with those in major urban areas.  There is a distinct difference.<\/p><p>I could safely say there is a higher level of drinking in the major urban areas than in rural areas and I will tell Members why.  There is a social issue with many of those rural pubs and small businesses in towns.  It is a gathering or meeting place.  In most circumstances, it does not involve people who want to get plastered every night of the week, although one will always get one or two.  As Deputy Cahill said here, it may involve a game of cards or a meeting.  I attend a lot of those meetings, political and otherwise.  The pub might be the only place in the local area where one can have a meeting.  As there may not be a hall or centre, people might use a room in the pub to have a meeting.  Again, I would say that the level of alcohol consumption is quite limited.  <\/p> <p> I will dwell on the issue of enforcement because punishment means little to people if they feel they will not be caught.  If they feel they will get away with it, they will not be too concerned.  I emphasise we must go back to checkpoints.  The introduction of the speed van to catch motorists who were breaking the speed limit was great but a speed van will not catch the drunken driver.  This is why we must have more checkpoints if we want to start stamping this out.  Our enforcement mechanisms are very poor.  <\/p> <p> Poor roads constitute another issue that sometimes is not addressed at all in respect of many accidents.  Anyone living in a rural constituency like mine will see many roads in a desperate state of repair with bad, sharp bends and with no action being taken to address them.  I accept that some have been addressed but in general, it is a matter of concern in many parts of rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p> I came across a figure while researching this issue that showed that as of this year, the number of garda&iacute; in the traffic corps was just 663, which is a decrease of 400 garda&iacute;.  In many respects, people will use the speed van as a way of saying we do not need them but I return to the point I made earlier.  We certainly need checkpoints because speed vans will not in any way detect drunken drivers.  <\/p> <p> Another factor relating to enforcement is the fact that 98% of disqualified drivers fail to return their licences to the Road Safety Authority, RSA, despite being so obliged.  As 98% of disqualified drivers still have their licences, if such people are stopped along the roadside and have their licence, they are getting away with it even though they have been disqualified.  This can only be described as a disgrace.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports increasing the penalties for driving while disqualified.  We support increasing the maximum prison sentence from six months to two years and increasing the maximum fine from &euro;5,000 to &euro;15,000.  My party believes this will be proper punishment and that we must deal with repeat offenders and have in place strong rules and regulations in this area so they are punished for what they do.  <\/p> <p> Between 2008 and 2012, 39% of drivers involved in fatal collisions where alcohol was a factor were aged between 15 and 24 years of age.  We fail young people by not tackling this issue.  We are not getting the message about the dangers of drink-driving through to some young people.  I always have been a believer in the education system.  If we want to get a message through to young people about drink-driving, we need to get into schools - even national schools - as well as secondary schools.  We need to get the message across there.  <\/p> <p> There are many other things I could say in this regard but Deputy Cahill has covered many of them.  <\/p><p>The legislation creates a challenge for rural Ireland.  The Minister has spoken in recent times about the Local Link service, which, I acknowledge, is a good system.  However, the Local Link service will not leave everyone home up every little highway or byway in rural Ireland because many of those buses cannot get up and down particular roads.  That is the immediate problem.  While it may solve part of the problem, it will not solve all of it.  Will the Minister take into consideration the challenge this creates for rural Ireland?  Those of us on this side of the House who genuinely want to stamp out drink-driving, as I am sure all Members do, are making the case that we do not want the total fabric of rural society completely destroyed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200009#J00200","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513082400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>During the course of the debate, we heard a lot of statistics on the rise in drink-driving cases and the level of impairment that can be caused by drink-driving even after consuming low amounts of alcohol.  Statistically, it has absolutely been proven.  Medical science has proven it and all the indications are that it is absolutely correct.  We have also heard concerns that the Bill is too extreme, that it will have a negative effect on rural Ireland and that there will be a financial cost.  Since I mentioned statistics, our current laws are definitely not sufficient to deter drink-drivers.  That is acknowledged right across the social sphere, even by drivers.  It is obvious that our current laws are not sufficient.  An average of 740 people were arrested every month in 2017 for drink-driving according to the Road Safety Authority.  Research suggests that in the past 12 months, 10% of motorists have driven a vehicle after consuming alcohol.  These are staggering statistics.  The vast majority of Irish drivers believe that having no alcohol before driving is the only way to be safe.  Having read all the statistics and gone through the facts and figures on deaths and injuries as a result of drink-driving, it is the only way to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  Behind the drink-driving statistics there are tragedies and devastated families .  During Leaders' Questions a number of months ago, Christina Donnelly from Waterford was present in the Gallery.  Her son was killed by a drink-driver and his friend was also killed in the collision.  It was not about politics for her.  There are indications from some people that this is about politics - us versus the Opposition or rural versus urban - but that is not the case.  It is interesting that we talk about statistics in rural and urban areas and mention things such as checkpoints, enforcement, the Garda traffic corps and poor roads.  I accept that Deputies were not saying poor roads are responsible for people drink-driving.  If I had my way - I have said this to the Minister - people with any alcohol in their systems would not be allowed to drive.  If legislation in this regard could prevent just one death and the devastation of one family once a year, it would be well worth it.  It is not beyond the realms of possibility for people who have a drink - and I have a drink - to get a taxi or to arrange something similar in rural areas.  I understand the difficulties in such areas.  When I go on holidays, I come across nice pubs that are isolated.  I might like to go to one and have a drink and have to get a taxi.  If all statistics show it is not working, then we have to change it.  In all of these statistics, there are indications that many people who may intend to go for one drink do not stop at one.<\/p><p>They do not intentionally say, \"I'm going to have one drink and then drink-drive\".  The genuinely do not mean that, but very many people end up having an extra drink.  There are indications that if someone is ill with the flu or has a heavy cold, one pint can affect their system and how they drive.  It all comes back to drinking and then driving.<\/p> <p> In Ireland, we have developed a culture that is now unacceptable but in the past was deemed all right for someone to say, \"I can take two or three pints and I can drive\".  That is not the case; everybody knows that.  Scientists and health officials will tell us the effects of one pint or so many particles of alcohol in one's system.  If we are ever to move from the drink-driving culture of our past, we need so send a clear message to motorists that alcohol and driving cannot be tolerated in society.  It just does not add up.  I am not a member of the medical profession, but I have listened to what they have had to say; I have listened to the debates.<\/p> <p> I have great sympathy for people in rural areas who might like to have a drink and find themselves enclosed in a small area unable to reach the pub.  There must be other ways of doing it rather than allowing them to go to the pub, drink and then drive home.  A person can be killed on a rural road, as can happen in an urban centre.<\/p> <p> Some of the criticism that has been levelled at the Minister, Deputy Ross, is unfair and unwarranted.  It is a genuine attempt to deal with this issue.  Having met groups from all over the country from all walks of life whose families had been affected by drink-drivers or drunk drivers - call it what one likes - he felt there was an onus and responsibility on him.  I met those families with him.  They were all devastated, having lost loved ones through drink-driving.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, felt this was the correct thing to do.  It was not politics because he has probably got more criticism than support from politicians.  Interestingly, the support he has got from the general public has been completely overwhelming.  Radio stations, including those in my area, have been overwhelmingly in their support.<\/p> <p> This is why I support the Bill.  I do not support it because it is sponsored by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and he is a comrade and friend of mine.  Those of us in the Independent Alliance have differences on it.  It would be interesting if other people had sat in the room where I sat with the Minister and 40 or 50 people who had all been affected by someone who was driving, having had alcohol.  It did not matter if it was four, one, six or ten pints.  They all lost loved ones and their families were devastated.  People would probably change their minds ever so slightly.<\/p> <p> I am sorry I do not have much more time to talk about this because I am sharing time with my comrade.  In consideration of the medical facts and of the statistics from the Road Safety Authority and other groups, this Bill is well worthwhile and will prove beneficial over the next number of years.  If everything in the Bill is implemented, it will reduce fatalities and critical injuries on our roads, and will justify what the Minister, Deputy Ross, is trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200011#L00200","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513082700,"counter":21,"content":"<p>A man when he was asked for directions in a rural area said, \"Well, if was going there, I wouldn't start from here\".  Likewise, if I had been talking about this Bill before it was introduced, I might have taken a different attitude.  It has been introduced and is in the public arena for debate.  No matter what way we look at it, a decision has to be made.  The decision, in turn, will have an impact on our attitude as elected representatives to the issue of drink-driving.  In those circumstances, we are running out of options.<\/p>  <p>  Many years ago I repeatedly raised the need for statistics on traffic accidents, in particular on roads with recurring incidences of deaths over ten, 15 or 20 years.  In one location in my constituency, more than 25 fatal accidents have taken place at the same junction or the same part of the road.<\/p><p>That draws people's attention to the cause of such accidents.  I am not aware of the cause in that particular area.  I do not believe that any one of the people involved was over the limit or had any drink taken.  It is simply one of those things that happen.  We cannot eliminate accidents entirely but we can eliminate some of the causes and it is our duty to so do to the best of our ability.  In this instance, it affects rural life to a greater extent than city life mainly because of transport issues but also because of rural depopulation.  The transport facilities are not available.  Taxis and late night buses are not available in rural Ireland because there is not the population to justify providing them.  That population has been decreasing for many years.  The Opposition Members will say the current Government or the previous one depopulated rural areas.  That is not the case and the former Minister opposite knows well that the population has been decreasing for many years.  Planners had an impact on it also because as we all know, and we must criticise them from time to time, planning policy in rural Ireland has been to limit to a huge extent the number of people who wish to live in rural Ireland.  I refer to the indigenous local population, which has been scaled down gradually over many years to the extent that we have arrived in a situation where the economics of providing the ancillary services we normally expect and enjoy in towns and cities no longer obtain and it is no longer viable to present that.  We should keep that at the back of our minds as we talk about this particular subject.<\/p> <p> We need to examine the problems that make life more difficult in rural Ireland and the difficulties that this or other legislation creates in rural Ireland.  Transport is one of those.  My colleague, Deputy Heydon, has set up an initiative to co-ordinate a number of Rural Link services in such a way as to provide transport - not necessarily for socialising but for necessary travel -  that people in rural Ireland are as entitled to expect to be able to avail of as are their colleagues in the city areas.  It is not easy to do that but it is possible and it must be done independently of the subject under discussion.  If not, it will be seen as a means of continuing to support what is known now as a drink culture.<\/p> <p> That said, we must also accept that all people, tourists included, like to enjoy the hospitality of the country and the cities but there is no question but that it is easier to do so in the cities than it is in rural areas.  Whether we want to support the development of the tourism industry and other industries in rural parts of the country is a matter for ourselves.  We can turn our backs on that or we can do something about it.  I believe we have to do something about improving the social fabric and the quality and level of services such as co-ordination of the Rural Link transport system and any other means whereby we can affect positively the attractiveness of rural Ireland and its services that, within reason, must be on a par with those available elsewhere.  That is a challenge but, nonetheless, it must be done.  If we do not do it, we will have a continued erosion of the quality of life in rural Ireland.  It was stated that the Garda stations have closed down.  That is the case in both urban and rural Ireland.  That is not a point for the Minister but a fact of life that they have closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200012#M00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513083000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Stepaside needs a new Garda station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200013#N00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1513083000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>We must not forget that we had an bord snip.

It happened during the term of office of a previous Government.  I will refrain from mentioning which Government happened to be in power at the time, but I do remember it.  My memory is not that bad.<\/p>  <p>  There was a large list of closures of facilities all over the country.  The Opposition nowadays is jumping up and down, howling with indignation about the closure of post offices, schools, libraries and other services in rural Ireland.  They were identified, pursued and closed then and nothing at all was said about it.  It does no harm occasionally to review where we came from, where we were, and who made the proposals at that particular time.  We can revisit that subject at any time.<\/p>  <p>  We have to move on from there, however, and improve ourselves and we are in the throes of doing that now.  We have options when it comes to this legislation.  We can walk away from it, but what is the message then?  The message to the young people of the country would be wrong.  The message to people who dare to drink and drive irresponsibly and recklessly would also be wrong.  I would not be happy to give that message now, because by doing so we would be contributing to the sorrow and hardship caused to families in urban and rural Ireland by someone driving while over the limit.  In those circumstances, we as legislators have no option other than to support the legislation.  We have to balance the issues and decide of what we are in favour.  <\/p>  <p>  On the totality of the issues that affect rural Ireland and the country in general and how this legislation is likely to impact on it, there is no doubt that it will have a different impact on rural Ireland compared to the cities.  There is no question about that.  Members have said that things are different in the country, and that is true.  There are longer distances to travel and a greater degree of isolation.  It is possible to be isolated in urban settings as well, but the difference is fundamental.  On the one hand, we have the legislation and, on the other, we can say that we are not in favour of curtailing drink-driving.  That would be a very strange message.  If we send that message from this House, we would be doing ourselves a great disservice, notwithstanding all of the things that need to be dealt with or the issues that people on the opposite side of the House and some on this side have spoken about.  <\/p>  <p>  Regardless of the outcome, we need to look very carefully at the issues which affect rural Ireland, including transport, culture, social life and the need to ensure that people are attracted to living in rural Ireland in the future.  We cannot just draw a line on the map and say that one will be fine if he or she is fortunate enough to live inside that line, or that if one lives in a city, he or she will be fine and, if not, things will be different.  Incidentally, we all hear from time to time about how the Government has neglected rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland has been on the decline for quite a long time, and it is up to us to realise that, de-politicise that situation and attempt to do something about it by way of providing Garda stations and post offices, dealing with the decline of the population, and dealing with the area of planning.  The issue in greatest need of improvement is planning.<\/p><p>We can legislate in this area so that there will be a population in rural Ireland in the future and people will wish to live there because the services they need will be there and will be on par with the services available elsewhere in the country and overseas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200014#O00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513083600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister on the opening of the new Luas line.

There are 20,000 people living in south Connemara.  Does the Minister imagine that all the young people are expected to go home at 6 p.m. or to use a car?  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is the most ineffective Minister so I am sorry that I must take back my congratulations on the Luas.  That was all decided long before the Minister came along.  He was just the lucky man who was there with the Taoiseach to pull the ribbon the other day.<\/p>  <p>  This issue goes to the nub of this Bill.  I believe that any death on the road is one death too many.  I am sure the Minister agrees with me.  However there are places we will not go to stop road deaths.  We would not set a speed limiter to 5 km\/h or 10 km\/h in every car to ensure that no car could go faster than that.  Technically speaking, it would be very effective, but in the real world we would not go there because it would be disproportionate when measured against the convenience of a car.  It is an exaggerated example, but such examples are quite good for pointing out fundamental principles, in this case the principle of proportionality, which we all accept in our day-to-day lives.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that, if we want to cut down on road accidents, the first thing we should look at is the vehicles themselves.  One thing has greatly decreased the level of mortality caused by cars in the past 30 or 40 years.  There were twice the number dying of people every year 20 or 30 years ago when there were far fewer cars on the road.  The reason for the decrease is not really that people have become safer or slower drivers.  We should not cod ourselves that all of these driving tests have made drivers much more skilful.   The safety features of the vehicles have had the biggest impact on road mortality.  Crumple zones, seat belts, airbags and all of these things mean that, thankfully, people survive accidents they would not have survived 30 or 40 years ago.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and I come from the same part of the world so he will know Raglan Road.  He will know the song of the same name which goes, \"On Raglan Road on an autumn day...\"  When I was a child, there was a winking willy on Raglan Road and Elgin Road.  In other words, there was a traffic light which showed a red light in one direction and an orange light in the other and which winked.  It was one of the few roads in Dublin at the time which had such a device.  It was put there because there had been a car accident there at some time in the 1950s in which somebody had been killed because both the person coming from Elgin Road and the person coming from Raglan Road thought they had the right of way.  It would be fair to say an equivalent type of accident happening nowadays would be very unlikely to kill anybody.  Neither car would have been doing more than 25 mph, 30 km\/h or 35 km\/h.  <\/p>  <p>  The first thing we should look at is technology.  It is very important that we examine the possibilities for reducing accidents using technology in cars.  The Minister will point to all of the changes which have taken place, including others which I have not mentioned.  There are two very obvious changes which could be introduced, however.  The first is that a device could be built into every car which would prevent ignition if the driver was over the legal blood-alcohol limit.  That could be mandatory for all new cars.  It might add a little bit to the cost of a car but it would reduce the insurance considerably.  The second measure would be to link a governor in a car to a GPS system, as is done with trucks.  This system would have all the speed limits in the country recorded within it.  This would make it impossible for a car to exceed the speed limit.  <\/p>  <p>  Sometimes, however, I think people do not like such solutions because they do not get to punish anybody.  It would be not much fun if the problem was solved without punishing people.  I think that people sometimes have a sadistic wish to punish people, rather than solving problems and making things safe.  If the Minister really wants to cut down the number of car accidents, let us look to technology first of all.<\/p>  <p>  It is very interesting that one of the safest ways to travel is by aeroplane.  One of the reasons that aeroplanes are so safe is that most of the time the pilots are not flying the planes.  They are not even landing the planes nowadays.  It is done by computer because the computer does not take days off, it does not get tired and it tends to be consistent.  The Minister will point to the occasional accident in which the computer might have been the problem, but in more than 99% of cases it is much more reliable than a human being.  Therefore, all the precedents are there to show that if we want to cut down accidents, the first thing that should be looked to is technology and enforced technology.  <\/p>  <p>  The next issue we must look at is the number of fatal accidents, or of accidents in which there was serious injury, which occur because people do not wear seat belts.  Is it more than the number of accidents which occur because people have a blood-alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml?  If it is a higher figure, that issue should be dealt with.  Again, there is a technological solution.  A car should not be able to move off unless all the people sitting in it are wearing seat belts.  I have personal reason to appreciate the importance of seat belts.  As was well reported at the time, I was in a car which was involved in a serious head-on collision.  I have no doubt that the technical knowledge, experience and training of the driver saved our lives.  He did something which not many lesser trained drivers would have.  This particular driver was top of the range.  When the car went straight for him, he took it on the nose.  I queried him afterwards and he said that he was trained to do so because cars are designed to crumple from the front.  Notwithstanding my experience, a head-on accident is potentially fatal.<\/p><p>In spite of the fact that he had braked and was almost stationary, the other car hit us at a significant speed.  I have no doubt that the fact that each of the three people in the car was wearing a seat belt saved our lives.  This House should deal with the issue of the non-usage of seat belts, which accounts for far more fatalities than the people targeted by the Bill, those driving with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml.  There are many things on which we agree and on which we would like the Minister to act.  <\/p> <p> I do not agree with drink-driving.  I was part of a Government that introduced the 50 mg to 80 mg limit.  I have no problem with the principle of it being totally unacceptable for a person to drive with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml in their blood.  That is not the issue.  It is no more acceptable to do that having left a rural pub than it is to do so having left an urban pub.  That is not the issue because if it is illegal, it is illegal.  Nobody has proposed that it should be made legal; all Members agree it should be illegal.  The issue is the proportionality of the penalty.  Speeding results in three penalty points and using one's mobile phone incurs four.  A driver is not disqualified for using his or her phone even though it is highly dangerous but we are not saying it is legal.  A person is not automatically disqualified for speeding.  Perhaps that should be the case for those driving at higher speeds because that is a massive cause of accidents, as can be seen from the statistics.  However, that has not been done.  Perhaps there should be a differentiation and a driver should receive two points for being less than 10 km\/h over the speed limit but three points for being between 10 km\/h and 20 km\/h over the limit and so on.  It sometimes seems ridiculous that a driver would receive the same fixed charge notice for driving at 90 km\/h or 120 km\/h in an 80 km\/h zone.  That is disproportionately weighted in favour of a person driving far in excess of the limit compared to a person who might have slid over the limit.  All Members know of people who have received a sanction while driving on quiet rural roads through small, sleepy villages with no pub.  I know a village that has no pub or shop but, rather, only a primary school that I assure the Minister does not open at night.  I have seen a Gatso van in that village and good luck to them.  It will catch people doing 59 km\/h.  If one is caught, one is caught.  <\/p> <p> Let us take the example of a person who is caught driving with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml and put off the road.  That person may live and work in the city and not need his or her car for work and his or her children may go to a local school or a location to which there is a bus or train, as is standard in the city.  If the person is disqualified for the appropriate period, it is an inconvenience to him or her but not a huge cost.  It might be a cause of embarrassment but life goes on.  When I come to Dublin, I often leave the car in the Oireachtas, whether I am staying in the city centre or in south County Dublin.  I use shank's mare or the DART.  It is far quicker and more convenient and I can get anywhere in the city that I wish.  If all else fails, I can get a taxi at 2 a.m. at a modest cost.<\/p> <p> Proportionality of penalty is a fundamental principle.  Let us now take an example of a person who lives in west Kerry or west Galway and is similarly caught driving with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg and put off the road.  I note that unfortunately Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has left the Chamber.  We could take the example of a person working in Galway.  That reminds me of the night a television comp&egrave;re complained that I had been driven home to Cornamona.  He asked me why I had not taken the train and I told him there is no train to Cornamona.  He asked me why I had not taken the bus and I explained that there is no bus to Cornamona.  How the hell was I meant to get there?  If one takes the licence of a person living in my area of Galway, as opposed to a person in the city, he or she would have to pay to be driven to and from work and for their children to be driven to and from school because the Government has cut the school transport system and if ten children do not live on the road on which one travels to school, a bus will not be provided.  Many schools in rural Ireland have no school bus service.  A driving ban would make day-to-day life impossible for such a person in terms of work and ferrying his or her children to all the events that children must attend.  The Minister should start doing the sums.  If such a person has to pay a driver every day, how much would it cost per week?  Our argument is not against the offence being illegal but, rather, against the disproportionality of the penalties in terms of the impact on different communities.  If a penalty were to be introduced that would disproportionately impact upon those living in cities and who have access to transport, we would never hear the end of it because we are told that a system cannot disproportionately penalise one group of people over another.<\/p> <p> To show our good faith and intentions on the issue, Fianna F&aacute;il believes the Minister should accept the compromise we have suggested, which is that five penalty points should be given to a person with an alcohol level of between 50 mg  and 80 mg per 100 ml.  A person with seven penalty points would be disqualified on receiving such a sanction.  Habitually risk-taking drivers would be disqualified.  Most people in rural Ireland would become very careful in order not to get caught again if they had received five penalty points for drink-driving because a speeding infraction would add another three penalty points and it would not take many more points to accumulate 12 and be disqualified.  The Minister must be rational and appreciate that I am not justifying drunk driving but that the penalties are disproportionate in terms of the impact on rural and urban dwellers.  There is a good proposal here.  We should see if it will have an effect and we should do all we can to reduce fatalities on the road, rather than become obsessed with one tiny little cohort of the causes of fatal accidents.  An easy issue to address is that of seat belts.  It should not be possible to drive a car without all occupants' seat belts being fastened.  That would save many lives.<\/p> <p> It is time to think it out again.  Nobody in their right mind condones a person driving while impaired through alcohol.  It is also fair to acknowledge that a person can inadvertently be caught with an blood-alcohol limit of between 50 mg and 80 mg.   It is an uncertain science and results are affected by body weight and so on.   A person may have had a night out and could be caught the next day with a level of 50 mg or 55 mg despite thinking he or she was safe to drive.  That could affect people with families, jobs and so on who would find their lives tumbling apart not because of the fine or social inconvenience, but because they could not do their daily tasks without a car.<\/p><p> Finally, in my last 40 seconds, I wish to say I cannot understand why the Minister has not yet moved on the funding imbalance in favour of urban bus services as against rural bus services or why he has not modernised bus services in rural Ireland if he really wants to provide for a better quality of life.  He has been totally inactive on policy.  Every time we ask him about policy, all he says is that it is a matter for the National Transport Authority, NTA, or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, or someone else.  The Minister is the Minister.  Policy is his remit and only his.  Will he start making policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200015#P00900","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513084800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  At first, to be honest, I grappled with the Bill, but I stand here as a parliamentarian faced with a very simple choice.  There has probably been an element of muddying of the waters in this debate, particularly on the part of the Opposition, and I will touch on those points in a while.  We have a simple choice.  Do we support a Bill that does not change the blood alcohol concentration limit at which someone who is driving breaks the law but instead changes the penalty in respect of this offence, or do we vote against the Bill and potentially send out a message that we as a Parliament are saying drink-driving - people driving on our roads while impaired and not in full possession of their senses and who could meet me, a loved one of mine or someone else close to me on those roads - is okay in this country?  This is a very stark choice.  Broken down in these simple terms, I will support the Bill.  We should consider the message we would send nationally and internationally if we were to choose the latter option.  Internationally, we think of our tourists, who want to come here on holiday and drive the Wild Atlantic Way.  The message could come out that they could meet people who drink and drive home from pubs and that they should be careful when on our roads.  These are the very simple messages.  We are all about simple messages here and this is how a decision to oppose the Bill could be translated.  If the Bill saves just one life, that is one whole family and extended circle of friends that will be saved the anguish and horror of a death on our roads which, particularly when caused by a drink-driver, is so avoidable.  Therefore, I stand here with an absolutely clear conscience that supporting the Bill is the right thing to do.<\/p><p>I referred to muddying of the waters.  There has been talk of old men in their 90s who live in isolated rural areas and travel to the local pub three nights a week for two pints at a time and leave it at that.  The focus of this debate has been all on the right of that man to have his couple of pints and then drive his car home.  The question has been asked, what harm is it.  We have been told such people have done so for years, that we should let them go and that they will never cause an accident.  There are a number of parts to this argument.  Fair play to the old man who is that disciplined because I, for one, have been in situations in which I have gone for one, but one was actually one round because I was with a friend, which makes two, and then all of a sudden someone buys a third pint.  The car has been out of the equation since the first pint but there is a second.  This pressure rolls on and if one does not have a backup plan as to how one gets home, if one lives in an area in which taxis are not available, all of a sudden one is in that spot because it was not planned for accordingly.  An awful lot of this is about planning and preparation.  Instead of the focus being on that man being entitled to drink his few pints and drive home, we should get to the nub of the problem that the man is living on his own, is lonely and is suffering in social isolation.<\/p><p>I am delighted that the Bill has brought forward into the House this discussion about the challenges we face in rural Ireland.  This debate should be about the fact that there are plenty of people living in rural Ireland who cannot access taxis or easily get about and the majority of whom do not want to have a drink.  My mother is a retired woman in her 70s.  She is very active and loves to play whist and bridge.  That is her thing.  She is never out later than 11 o'clock at night, but her and her friends, particularly at this time of the year, are out playing for turkeys every night of the week.  Luckily enough, she is able to drive to such events, but sometimes she will bring friends and neighbours who do not have lifts.  Not everyone is always lucky enough to have someone who can pick them up and bring them home.  I welcome that this issue of social isolation is being brought to the fore.  However, when we talk about rural transport, something about which I am passionate, as the Minister is aware, we allow the debate get sucked into the topic of what the people will use the bus for and, when they get to the rural destination on the rural bus, what they will do.  We never ask this question when Dublin Bus announces additional routes or when Bus &Eacute;ireann runs extra routes from Limerick to Galway but somehow we get fixated on what these people will do in this regard.  I will tell the House what they will do.  We should consider where the Local Link rural bus services are working really well, such as in south Kildare with the Athy-Newbridge route that goes through small rural areas such as Kildangan, Kilberry and Nurney.  We should consider the very extensive list of routes in the Kerry area, with which I have become very familiar in recent times.  I refer to Carmel Walsh and the great Local Link team down there.  They offer such a wide array of services and access for people in rural areas.  Our problem currently is that most of these routes finish at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the day and that there is no access in the evenings.  In the summertime, if there were more routes operational in the evenings, people could go down into their villages to see the local GAA club play a match and get that bus back home afterwards.  They might go for a pint and they are free to do so if they want - it is a free country - or they might want to go play bingo or cards or just call on other elderly relatives and friends who also live alone.  What we want to do, and what we should be focused on as a Government, is to improve this access in order that people can move around their areas as best they can.  That is why I am trying to move the conversation on from what is a very narrow debate here to what is a much more important and much broader one.<\/p><p>In ten, 15 or 20 years' time, I think we will look back on this debate and be shocked by some of the arguments made, in the same way as we look back 20 years and see the adverts that say &quot;don't drive with five&quot; because it was fine to drive after having drunk four pints back then.  We laugh now to think that was so acceptable.  Similarly, people will look back on this debate we are having about how much drink-driving is okay.  It will not be socially acceptable.  It is probably already not socially acceptable in large parts of the country, even though Members of this House are making that argument now.  In time we will see that debate move on.<\/p><p>This is why, as chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, I engage with the Minister on the issue of social isolation.  I accept in our dealings that he definitely wants to bring about improvements to this in rural Ireland and I have been impressed by his response to the issue and the engagement I know he has had with a number of rural groups.  He has taken on board their points and concerns about the Bill.  The Bill has opened up a conversation about a much bigger issue.  I engage with the Local Link rural bus transport network to see how we can take what is a very good model with huge potential and make it better.  Working with Local Link, we came up with an initial proposal of 38 routes across 12 Local Link companies in 15 counties.  Donegal, Tipperary and Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon - there is one Local Link for the latter three counties - also have proposals for consideration to be submitted to the Minister and the NTA.  This is not a silver bullet; it is a very significant pilot proposal that, were it to be funded and enacted, would provide more than 11,000 additional trips around rural Ireland per annum.  This would allow people go play cards or bingo, carry out visitations, go to the pub or do whatever else they want to do and would increase flexibility.  So much of what is at the heart of rural transport is that it ends up being community-led, so why are we here saying there is no point in putting on buses in certain areas because there is no activity in those areas?  It is a chicken and egg scenario.  There is no activity in the village because no one who lives in the rural hinterland surrounding it can get into the village.  However, Carmel Walsh in Kerry Local Link or Alan Kerry in Kildare will say that once this discussion came about, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, in parts of Kerry became involved.  There was a group from Valentia Island that wanted to go dancing in Killarney.  They inquired about the proposal of a late evening bus from Valentia to Portmagee that would then link them up with a bigger bus that would bring them into Ireland's National Event Centre, the INEC, in Killarney.  If a man nearby wants to get on that bus and go for a pint, more luck to him, or if a couple want to go out for a meal or to the cinema, who cares?  The fact is we have provided for accessibility into a remote part of rural Ireland, probably one of the remotest any of us could think of.  These are lovely places to visit during the summer, but at this time of the year, with long, dark evenings, they are lonely places to live on one's own.  These are the kinds of ideas we should consider.  We have a co-funded HSE rural community project that does visitations to people who live on their own.  The group was considering organising an event whereby 12 or 14 people would come together in Ballylongford in north Kerry and improve accessibility for these people.  This happens already in Lyracrumpane, where about 15 people get together once a week for a game of cards, facilitated by the rural transport network.  This brings a flexibility to their activities.<\/p><p>I was on local radio in Kerry recently because I was the subject of some criticism in respect of this proposal.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, unfortunately, ran to a journalist to attack the proposal, presumably before he realised that his constituency in Kerry would be the biggest beneficiary of the proposal, with 15 of the 38 routes.  While he was critical in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, the Minister will be happy to hear that he clarified on Radio Kerry in a debate with me that he was very supportive of the proposal and I am sure he will put that support on the record of the House in the not too distant future.<\/p><p>He was keen to tell the people of Kerry how much he supports rural transport, which I am sure is the case.  Meanwhile, his brother, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, had a pop at me in the House last week, claiming that I do not understand rural Ireland and that no part of County Kildare can be described as rural.  In fairness to him, he invited me to visit the Ring of Kerry and other rural parts of the county.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said on a previous occasion that this Government does not recognise anything outside the M50.  Perhaps Danny Healy-Rae is under the confused impression that all of Kildare is inside the M50.<br\/><br\/>As a member of a rural community in south Kildare and having been a farmer before I was a Deputy, as chairman of Fine Gael's agriculture committee for five years and a member of the Oireachtas joint committee dealing with rural affairs for the past two years, I assure the Deputy that we do have rural areas in south Kildare.  Indeed, the challenges for people in Bigstone, Carbury, Levitstown and Ballymore Eustace are every bit as real as those facing people in Kerry, Mayo or Donegal.  I do not need to take the Deputy up on of his offer to visit Kerry as I have holidayed there several times and hope to go again next August with my family.  If I am driving around Kerry with my wife in the passenger seat and my two children in the back, I do not want to encounter a driver who has had three, four or five pints, no matter how large a dinner he or she might have had.  I return Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's offer by inviting him to visit south Kildare.  I understand Kerry but he does not seem to have much understanding of my county.  If he takes up my offer, he will see that we share many of the same struggles and hold the same position on many issues.  The problem is that the debate has become skewed and there is political point-scoring going on in some quarters.<br\/><br\/>I am passionate about rural transport and the potential it has to improve the quality of life of people living in rural areas.  In many ways, we are only scratching the surface with the existing provision.  Of the 17 Local Link companies in operation, I am the first to acknowledge that some are more proactive and better developed than others.  If the pilot scheme I have proposed is given a chance, over the course of six months or a year we will see passenger numbers matching those on the Athy to Newbridge route in south Kildare and other successful routes across the country.  By opening up access to rural transport in the evenings, we offer whole communities a new lease of life.  This is not about getting people to and from the pub but, rather, connecting communities.  A previous speaker noted that an bord snip nua, which was established during the recession under the chairmanship of Mr. Colm McCarthy, recommended that the then allocation of &euro;11 million for rural transport should be reduced.  I was one of the advocates arguing that rural transport was, in fact, one of the national programmes that offered best value for money.  I remain convinced of that and, as such, welcome the increase in funding to &euro;17 million.  That investment is coming back to us fourfold.<br\/><br\/>There remains a great deal more to be done.  In Kildare we are fortunate to have a very good director of services for transport as well as supportive councillors.  Next year, local property tax revenues will be used to put branding on Local Link buses and develop bus shelters in designated locations.  The National Transport Authority has given the go-ahead to the Kildare-South Dublin Local Link service to install 41 lollipop-sign bus stops and advertise the timetables.  These sound like simple things but, as it stands, the service is too <i>ad hoc<\/i>to be as successful as it can be.  Some &euro;15,000 has been put aside to trial a system next year, which will engage a number of local hackney drivers to provide an extended service to rural areas in County Kildare.  People often complain about the difficulty of getting a taxi, but the problem is that everybody wants to avail of the service at the same time of the week, usually a Friday or Saturday night.  The local hackney driver in my area, Donie King, is often subjected to complaints because, at the most popular times, it can take him two hours to get to a job, if he can do it at all.  However, he has a much smaller workload during the week.  Under the trial arrangement, drivers like Donie King will be paid a retainer to remain on stand-by to accommodate people in rural areas who cannot otherwise access rural transport.  This means that Mrs. Murphy, who does not live on the linear route from Athy to Newbridge but is within 5 km of it, can telephone Local Link to say she needs to get to Newbridge the next day.  The hackney driver will call to her house and take her to the Local Link bus.  Her business might be in Newbridge, in Naas General Hospital or in Dublin, but the connectivity is now there to allow her to make her journey via public transport.  If we invest adequately in the services, there is great potential there for the future.<br\/><br\/>As I said, we have only scraped the surface of what can be achieved.  Enhancing transport services is the single greatest action we can take to address quality of life issues in rural areas.  Colleagues will recall that The Gathering initiative was successful not because people in Dublin issued instructions about it but because rural communities across the length and breadth of the country embraced it as the great idea it was.  I recall that I was driving to a meeting in Kilcullen the same day we had the media reports of how Gabriel Byrne had ridiculed the whole idea of The Gathering.  Expecting to encounter a cool response at the meeting, I instead found great enthusiasm among members of the local community and a determination to get involved in encouraging expatriates who were born in the area to return for a visit.  That initiative worked because people all over the country bought into it and the same can be achieved in the area of rural transport.  Enabling groups of people to travel to a central point and engage in social activities together is good for communities.  The Government will never fix all the problems of rural areas and the Opposition will always attack it on that basis.  It is our job to enable rural communities to become more self-sufficient by helping themselves.  One way of doing so is to address the deficit in public transport that exists in rural Ireland.  I hope my proposal receives a positive hearing because it has huge merit as an extensive pilot.  If it proves successful, it can be rolled out throughout the country.  I thank the Minister for his engagement on this matter and look forward to further engagement with him in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200017#R00200","speaker":"1237","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513085400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I do not support or encourage drink-driving.  Everyone can enjoy alcohol if it is consumed responsibly, as the vast majority of people do, and there is personal responsibility for one's actions and behaviour.  Nobody in this House or outside it condones a situation where a driver who has taken excessive alcohol causes an accident or fatality.  I have met the various representative groups advocating on this matter, some of which support the Government proposals and some of which oppose them.  I have supported the Government on several important matters since its establishment.  In this instance, however, I cannot and will not support the legislation that has been presented to the House.  The Minister's priorities are wrong in this matter and he has brought forward measures that are unnecessary and excessive and which target the wrong cohort of people.  In particular, the Bill will impact on people living in isolated rural parishes that are far removed from public transport services.  The Minister is fortunate that in his constituency one can choose between the DART, Luas and bus.  Alternatively, a taxi will arrive to one's home within ten to 15 minutes.  We in Tipperary, as elsewhere in rural Ireland, do not have any of those transport options.  I was in Thurles last weekend and it proved impossible to get a taxi to my home in Holycross.  There are insufficient numbers of taxi vehicles and, in addition, demand tends to peak at certain times.<\/p>  <p>  My main concern regarding these proposals is that the penalties it sets out are totally disproportionate.  This will particularly affect young people who need to travel to work after having enjoyed a few drinks the night before as part of a social occasion.<\/p><p>We are hearing about people who get up in the morning to go to work.  I have great admiration for the young person who is able and capable of working, who gets up in the morning, does a day's work, goes out to socialise and does the right thing by leaving the car behind and then gets a taxi home.  However, perhaps because of his or her body mass or as a result of a misunderstanding regarding how fast the body can eliminate the after-effects of alcohol, he or she is busted the following morning at a checkpoint.  The person might fail the test by the slightest margin and yet, as a result, he or she is put off the road completely.  This is totally disproportionate.  That person's job is impacted.  He or she is willing to make his or her contribution to society, earn his or her keep and not be a burden on anybody.  That person is penalised to an extent that is unfair, unjust and disproportionate.<br\/><br\/>Garda&iacute; operating in our communities need the support and must enjoy the confidence of the public.  The Garda should show a lot more discretion with morning-after breathalysing, which has terrorised rural Ireland.  In many areas, people have a bunker-down attitude.  They are afraid to do the normal things one would expect, especially from young people.  If young people do the right thing and obey the law, and the day after they find they are disqualified from driving due to being a minimal amount over the limit, it means the repercussions of the legislation are excessive.<br\/><br\/>I represent the constituency of Tipperary North.  Tipperary is a rural, inland county that has suffered all the negative effects of being situated away from the coast and major cities.  It is split into two large, sprawling constituencies that are home to numerous small to medium-sized rural towns and villages.  Over the years, I have witnessed the gradual decline of all these towns and villages.  Towns such as Thurles, Templemore, Nenagh, Tipperary town, Cahir, Cashel and Carrick-on-Suir, which were once lively, vibrant places to work and live have struggled over time and, despite all, have still managed to survive.  This is due in no small measure to the strong sense of community spirit and belonging that pervades these places.  Most have managed to survive, not as a result of Government grants or subsidies, but from a huge volunteering effort on the part of many locals and groups in activities such as Tidy Towns competition, local festivals, etc.  We should salute these people for the wonderful efforts they continue to make in order to ensure that future generations will be able to remain in these rural towns and villages that are such a part of our history.  The towns and villages in question are hurting badly.  This hurt is increasing on a daily basis.  If we drive through any of them, we will see far too many signs proclaiming &quot;For Sale&quot; or &quot;For Rent&quot;.  We also have too many boarded up shopfronts.  The principal and often only activities in many of these places relate to local primary and second-level schools.<br\/><br\/>In recent years, all of these towns and villages have witnessed the closure of small factories, Garda stations, post offices and many small retail outlets.  If this legislation is to pass, we will witness the closure of numerous small rural pubs that are already desperately struggling to survive.  Since time immemorial, the pub has been a focal point of social life in rural Ireland.  We only need look at television series such as &quot;The Riordans&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;Glenroe&quot;, &quot;Fair City&quot; and &quot;Ros na R&uacute;n&quot; to see the role the pub plays in Irish social life.  They are often described as friendly and homely places.  Many people believe they foster social relationships among residents, strengthen the level of cohesion in villages and positively contribute to communal well-being.<br\/><br\/>Many elderly people who live alone in very isolated areas often use the pub as often their only weekly social outing when they can meet friends in a relaxed environment to play a game of cards or simply have a chat.  Many Members of this House, myself included, use the pub for political clinics, meetings or simply to meet constituents and be informed on local and personal topical issues.  Recent studies, including one published in the <i>International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality, <\/i>have found that in the UK, for example, pubs have a very positive and significant impact on social engagement and involvement among residents living in the English countryside.  Significantly, the study in question also found that this positive effect increased threefold between the years 2000 and 2010, possibly because pubs have become increasingly important because, as in Ireland, other essential services, such as post offices and village shops, have closed.  The study also highlights the fact that parishes with pubs have more community events, such as sports matches, charity events and social clubs, than those which do not have pubs.  Put simply, opportunities for community initiatives would be vastly reduced or non-existent in these parishes without the presence of a pub.  The same applies to Ireland, if not more so.<br\/><br\/>Local Garda stations - in the days before a number of them were closed - were not just places where somebody could go to get assistance with some aspect of State administration.  Very often, a person would use the opportunity of his or her visit to keep garda&iacute; informed of any suspicious activity of which he or she might be aware.  To a great degree, the pub is now the only place where members of a local community can share information and concerns and, by so doing, help to support and protect each other.<br\/><br\/>Nor should we forget the key role pubs, including those in rural areas, play in the context of the tourism industry.  Research shows that more than 80% of tourists frequent pubs to get food or for entertainment purposes.  The pub is the number one tourism attraction for many people who visit Ireland.  Let us also not forget that the Irish pub was previously voted as the number one tourist attraction in Ireland by the <i>Lonely Planet <\/i>guide.<br\/><br\/>There is a jobs aspect to rural pubs.  Current figures indicate that more than 90,000 people are dependent on the drinks industry for employment.  The majority of these individuals work in the pub trade.  The reality is that pubs create badly-needed jobs - often part-time in nature - in rural areas where there is not much other employment.  The closure of huge numbers of these rural pubs, which is the inevitable outcome if this legislation is passed, will mark the end of these rural villages in all but name.  In many of these villages, the picture is usually the same: the creamery closed long ago; the local meal store is closed; the hardware shop is closed; the post office is closed; the petrol station is closed; and the comer shop is either closed or on the brink of closure.  The local pub is often the only survivor, even though it probably only opens at night or on weekends.  Through this proposed legislation, we are now threatening to close that too.  The closure of these pubs will have very significant effects on rural areas and those who live there.  Already cut off from society, this final straw will further isolate these people.  The consequential results will manifest themselves in ever-increasing mental health issues, including depression and a rising rate of suicide.  Those living alone go to the local pub to meet friends, have a drink or two and then go home.  This is the highlight of their week apart, perhaps, from attending mass in the local church.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200018#S00200","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513086600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy when he has another six minutes, but we have reached 2 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200020#U00100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1513086600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1513086600,"counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200020#U00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1513086600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I ask Members to try to stay within the allocated time, given that we are late starting Leaders' Questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200020#U00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1513086600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>A nation and a society must hold certain values and qualities, of which one is to nurture and protect its artists, and particularly its musicians.  The RT&Eacute; symphony and concert orchestras have been an essential and acclaimed part of our national cultural life over many decades.  Founded in 1948, they have become the biggest employers of musicians throughout the country.  The orchestras are a key component of our musical ecosystem.  Many of our graduates from Ireland's music schools, academies and colleges gain employment in them and others aspire to become members.  Standards of excellence in performance are set by the orchestras for others to emulate.  Many of their members engage in education, many teach in higher education and many perform across the country.  Their reach is far and wide.  In the words of Aod&aacute;n &Oacute; Dubhgaill, the orchestras have a singular place in the Irish musical heritage.  They have nurtured through performance and education generations of world-class musicians.<\/p>  <p>  RT&Eacute; has announced a review of its two orchestras amid challenging financial circumstances - that is code for RT&Eacute; being in deep financial trouble.  The orchestras are already short of 30 musicians, there have been suggestions that they will be 40 musicians short next year.  Some fear that there might be an amalgamation leading to the loss of the entire concert orchestra.  Other managers are talking about one fifth of orchestral musicians being lost to the system.  There is no sense of future planning or vision for these orchestras.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot wash its hands of this and cannot stand idly by.  The orchestras are a national treasure.  They have developed a tradition of musical excellence that has been built up painstakingly over decades and are a key part of our national cultural life.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene to ensure that the allocation for orchestras be ring fenced and not fall victim to RT&Eacute;'s genuine financial difficulties.  It cannot become a victim in the ongoing tug of war between RT&Eacute; and the Government regarding the licence fee.  The Government, through the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment should intervene and I ask the Taoiseach to ask them to do so and to do what is necessary.  If that requires further Exchequer funds in addition to their revenue from the RT&Eacute; licence fee allocation, then so be it, that should be done.  The two orchestras could then plan with a degree of certainty and excitement for the future instead of being at the whim of various reviews every year.

Out of the &euro;5 million, we have already accounted for &euro;1.5 million on what seems to be a very determined effort to keep the media onside by doshing out lots of advertising.  I have no problem with supporting the media but it should be done on a stand-alone basis, separate from Government and from its political arms.  The orchestra could have done with that &euro;1.5 million.  Let us at least support that which has depth, solidity and tradition.  The RT&Eacute; orchestras are the jewel in the crown of our cultural life but they are losing positions and those positions are not being replaced, yet we get these fantastic press releases, gatherings and announcements on money being frittered away.

Today, there is a day-long protest outside the D&aacute;il organised by My Name Is, and I commend all those involved.  They are holding this protest because they care and because the Government is refusing to take the necessary actions to end this scourge on our society.<\/p>  <p>  Homelessness in this State is now at emergency levels.  It is an alarming reality that over 8,000 of our citizens, including in excess of 3,000 children, are homeless as Christmas approaches.  Eight people have died on our streets since August and that is not acceptable by any standard, any measure or statistic or any report - national or international - that the Taoiseach may reference.  Imagine being without a home at any time.  N&iacute;l aon tinte&aacute;n mar do thinte&aacute;n f&eacute;in, mar a deirtear sa Ghaeilge, go h&aacute;irithe le linn aimsir na Nollag.  Imagine not having a home or even a stable at Christmas.  There are parts of this State where there are no emergency beds and no facilities that are suitable for some of our citizens who are forced to sleep on the streets.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach often claims that no one in this D&aacute;il has a monopoly on compassion and that is true.  There are also complexities to all of this.  However, there is nothing as complex as the issues a homeless person faces in the struggles of his or her daily life.  Results count, Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach leads the Government.  A truly compassionate Government would implement compassionate policies that would make a real difference to the lives of homeless citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency has been offered 1,800 vacant, turnkey-condition homes to purchase in the past year by banks, funds and other sources.  They could be bought and families could move into them immediately but, of these 1,800 homes, the Government has agreed to buy only 600.  I accept that perhaps not all of the homes are suitable but it is hard to believe that 1,200 are unsuitable.  I do not believe the Government thinks that there is a housing emergency.  If it did believe, it would not waste any opportunity to house citizens.  People are dying on the streets and children are spending their childhoods in emergency accommodation, while families are losing hope on housing waiting lists.  Can the Taoiseach explain to the D&aacute;il why the Government is purchasing only 600 of the 1,800 homes on offer?  Can he also explain why it has taken so long to purchase and allocate to families the homes it has bought?  What is he going to do to ensure that no citizen is forced to sleep on the streets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200021#V00500","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1513087200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I will have to come back to the Deputy on the detailed numbers relating to those homes.  I think they were some time ago and, if I recall correctly, a number of them were not in areas where there was a high level of demand for social housing.  As a result, they were not all suitable for social housing.  I will certainly get the details on that and give the Deputy a detailed answer by correspondence.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cares a lot about homelessness, not just at this time of the year but at all times of the year.  As Taoiseach, I care a lot about it too and, as I have said before, I consider homelessness to be a stain on our society.  We need to do everything we can to reduce it - and eliminate it if possible - in the months and years ahead.  In the past week or two, I visited a family hub to meet some of the homeless families who live there.  I also met some rough sleepers to try to understand a bit better their experience and what they face.  Among the actions the Government is taking is an &euro;18 million increase in the budget for homelessness services next year, bringing the total up to &euro;118 million.  The number of families in bed and breakfast establishments and hotels is down substantially from when it peaked last spring as a result of the development of family hubs, of which there are many more coming on stream.  An additional 200 emergency beds for rough sleepers are being put in place in the coming weeks to ensure that there will be a bed available for everyone who needs one - not just at Christmas but into the new year, over the winter period and into spring and summer.  A particular effort is being made to encourage people to use these new beds, which are in single and double rooms and not dormitories.<\/p>  <p>  On Sunday night, which was very cold, an analysis was carried out and major efforts were made in the Dublin region by the staff of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and others to make sure all rough sleepers had the option of emergency beds and ten beds for females were unused, while there was one male bed vacancy.  No one was not placed.  As recently as Sunday night, there was adequate capacity in the system to provide an emergency bed in Dublin for every man or woman who wanted one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200021#V00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1513087200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>It is not only a Dublin problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200021#V00700","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1513087200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>We will continue to increase capacity in the next couple of weeks so we can ensure that there will be an emergency bed available for anyone who needs one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200021#V00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1513087200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The fact that the Taoiseach is not able to answer my question underlines the case I made, which is that the Government does not believe there is an emergency in the context of homelessness.

Little did I know then the can of worms I would open.  John Patrick Harrington, a 90-year-old man, left Bantry for a 1,000 km round trip to Kingsbridge Hospital in Belfast for a cataract operation, which was arranged in three weeks, whereas had he waited in Ireland, he would have had to wait three to four years.  Since the story broke we have heard of consultants working 13 hours per week, and of women forced to sell jewellery and personal belongings to have a 20-minute simple cataract procedure.  More than 8,000 people are seeking that simple procedure.  Next Saturday, a bus full of older people will leave west Cork and Kerry for Belfast for cataract operations under the cross-border directive.  The 13 people who will have operations on Sunday morning range in age from 65 to 90 years.  Their greatest worry is they will go blind, as many getting the bus have waited for three years and cannot wait any longer.  This is the first of many buses organised from Cork and Kerry.  The next bus will be in early January and another will follow at the end of January.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach whether this is the right way to treat some of the most vulnerable people in our society, who did get up early in the morning, who paid PRSI all of their lives and who, sadly, now realise it was all for nothing as the State would let them go blind rather than perform a 20-minute procedure.  These law-abiding taxpayers, who contributed all of their lives to their community and the tax system, now realise it is a choice of going to Belfast this weekend or going blind.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, a constituent contacted me regarding the situation whereby the person's father has been cared for by the person 24-7 for 11 and a half years following a devastating major stroke.  The person's father recently transferred to a long-term care facility.  It has now come to light that he is 100% blind in one eye and has only 30% sight in the other.  This gentleman has lost his speech and ability to walk.  Does he now have to face losing his sight also?  He worked all of his life, paid PRSI and contributed greatly to his community.  He is not well enough to be able to travel to Belfast.  He has a medical card and private health insurance but there is nowhere for him to have this simple procedure urgently in County Cork.  Does this seem fair to the Taoiseach?<\/p>  <p>  Since my previous contribution on Leaders' Questions, I mentioned Bantry General Hospital and the major concerns the public had regarding the retirement of a surgical consultant.  Thanks to raising the issue on the floor of the Chamber, the issue has been resolved.  Bantry General Hospital is renowned for the excellent service it provides to the population it serves.  Why must a bus leave Bantry at 9 a.m. on Saturday morning when a state-of-the-art theatre, which only recently received a major upgrade, is only partially used?  Why can these simple procedures not be carried out in Bantry instead of inflicting this long and hard journey on older people?  The theatre capacity available at present could be constructively used to address the backlog of cataract procedures in County Cork and parts of Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  Since I spoke on this issue seven weeks ago, I have met credit union managers all over west Cork to secure loans for those who need them and who are travelling to Belfast.  I have also met the Cork University Hospital group managers.  These meetings have all helped me to progress this matter.  What has the Taoiseach done to help the 8,000 vulnerable Irish people who face the bleak prospect of going blind on his watch?  Has he met and engaged with the ophthalmologists who can work towards resolving the situation?  Has he spoken to the HSE regarding a funding allocation for other hospitals similar to Bantry General Hospital throughout the country, which could provide theatre time to address the national backlog of cataract procedures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200022#W01900","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1513087800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins.  To answer his question, it is not the right way to treat our citizens.  Nobody should have to wait for long periods for any procedure and certainly not a cataract procedure which, as the Deputy knows, can save people's sight, allowing them to maintain their independence and, in many cases, avoid further injuries that can occur because of sight loss.<\/p>  <p>  What are we doing about it?  We are doing quite a lot when it comes to cataracts.  The Deputy mentioned that people are travelling to Northern Ireland and other countries.  That is not happening by chance.  It is part of the cross-border directive, a European law to which we signed up as a Government whereby we fund people to have their treatment in Belfast, Derry and Enniskillen in the United Kingdom so they can have their treatment done more quickly overseas, even if it means us paying another Government or another health administration to do so.  That is something we have signed up to and something we now fund.  In addition to this, we have been increasing funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Funding has increased from approximately &euro;20 million this year and will rise to &euro;50 million next year.  This is already showing considerable results.  The Deputy may have noticed from the figures released on Friday that for four months in row, the number of people waiting for a hospital procedure, operation or scope has decreased.  The number of people waiting has fallen from a high of 86,000 earlier this year to 80,595 now, at the end of November.  More than 56% of patients are now waiting less than six months for their procedure.  That is four months in a row during which the number of people waiting for operations and procedures has fallen and we will continue to resource both the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund in order that we keep seeing the number of people waiting for hips, knees, cataracts and other operations falling.  It will not be done like it was in the past.  We will not just throw money at it for a few months and knock a bunch of people off the waiting list and then see it rise again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200022#W02000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1513087800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>That is not in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200022#W02100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1513087800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>What we are going to see from now on is consistent steady falls in the number of people waiting.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have the exact figures for cataracts.

I ask the Taoiseach to address this serious issue and grave situation regarding 8,000 Irish citizens accessing a cataract procedure.  This is such a serious and urgent issue I ask the Taoiseach kindly to address the areas of concern for so many vulnerable people in the country.  Do they have to continue to undertake the stressful long journey to Belfast to have this procedure carried out?  Can we not find provision in our HSE service delivery plans to factor in addressing the lengthy waiting list for this procedure?  This procedure does not block beds and is a simple day procedure that could be carried out in some of the theatres that are available in Ireland where capacity for theatre time exists.

We are at a situation now where one third of people wait less than three months and more than half of people wait less than six months.  I would like to get to the point where we are a normal country with a normal public health service and we do not have very many people at all waiting more than three months.  There will often be people waiting six, eight or 12 weeks, even people with the best and most expensive private health insurance packages, but I would like to get to the point where the number of people waiting more than three months really starts to fall dramatically.

The last question is important because there are still many unanswered questions as to how the trawl was carried out.  Given that the country spent a week watching the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il tie themselves in knots over what the then Minister knew and when she knew it, obviously the accounts of the then Minister and her advisers should have been examined and searched as part of this trawl.  However, it was confirmed to me in a recent email from the current Minister that, inexplicably, those three accounts were not searched.  Can the Taoiseach provide an assurance that the failure to search these accounts in the trawl will be examined as part of the senior counsel's review?  If so, will he direct the Department to check these accounts for correspondence relevant to the disclosures tribunal?<\/p><p>I ask the Taoiseach to reply to my three direct questions.

Despite this, and as no one knows better than the Taoiseach, who is a medical doctor, we have the most extraordinary waiting list of up to 700,000 people.  According to comments attributed to him in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the Taoiseach is hoping to arrive at a situation where at least two patients per week will not be referred by their GPs to hospital.  With 2,500 GPs, that would amount to 20,000 patients per month, which would be a great way of reducing the waiting list.  How does the Taoiseach propose to do this?  Does he realise that most of our GPs are overstretched, overworked and deeply stressed?  I cannot see this working.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might reveal to the House how he proposes to turn this situation around in the way suggested in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200026#AA02100","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1513090200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I did not read the article, but I know what I said.  What I said was that, if the average GP referred two fewer people to specialists each week, that would be 5,000 fewer referrals a week and 20,000 fewer referrals a month and, without any additional capacity at all in our hospitals, we would see waiting lists fall.  How could that be done?  In two ways.  First, provide GPs with better access to investigations so that they do not need to send somebody to a specialist who then sends him or her for a scan, scope or whatever.  They could have direct access to investigations.  We are starting to make that happen, but it is happening far too slowly.  The other aspect, of course, is to allow and fund more GPs to perform more procedures themselves, for example, minor surgeries.  When I was the Minister for Health, I started that - allowing GPs to do minor operations and be paid for them rather than referring patients to specialists.<\/p>  <p>  The second way is accountability.  We do not actually monitor referral rates by GPs, so we do not know who are the ones who refer too many patients and we do not know who are the ones who are appropriate and efficient in their referrals.  Other countries do, and they can identify GPs who are over-referring and take action to encourage them to be more appropriate in their referrals.  They can identify the GPs who refer appropriately and do not refer very often.  They actually get fast-track access to specialists.  That is what is done in other countries and we should do it here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200026#AA02200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1513090200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Why does the Government not do that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200026#AA02300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1513090200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Resistance, as always.

He outlined how, to facilitate this approach, a parliamentary liaison unit was established.  He specifically said that it was to facilitate an enhanced relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>More recently this role of improving communications between the Ministers and the Opposition spokespersons has disappeared completely, as it did today, from any definition of the unit.  Can the Taoiseach explain if the parliamentary liaison unit has any role in engaging with the Opposition parties or Members on the preparation of legislation as set out by his predecessor?<\/p> <p> Could he also outline to the D&aacute;il his current thinking on Seanad reform?  The Manning report was published in April 2015.  The former Taoiseach wrote to party leaders last year seeking nominations.  We nominated Seanad&oacute;ir Rose Conway-Walsh.  There has been no contact with her since then.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government, which is now 18 months old, contains a commitment to pursue the implementation of the Manning report as a priority.  I wrote to the Taoiseach on this issue in August and in a reply to me in October he said he would be contacting party leaders with a view to having the group up and running as soon as possible.  He also said the implementation group would be up in the next few weeks.  Two months later, no one has been in touch with me and neither have I seen any evidence of the implementation group being established or the chairperson being identified.  Will the Taoiseach undertake to liaise with Opposition parties to expedite this matter early in the new year?

Rather like the strategic communications unit, this appears to be something which could have a lot of mission creep.  When it was first introduced the indication, as now, was that it was to deal with minority members of the Government.  It is worth reminding the Taoiseach that Parliament is made up of a variety of different parties and Independents, not all of whom are either in or supporting the Government with confidence and supply.  If there is an information structure for liaison, explanation and information about initiatives being undertaken by the Government it is right that, as with the strategic communications unit, that kind of information is available on an equal basis to all the parties and all the Members of the Oireachtas.  Otherwise, it smacks of more resources being devoted to Government for information purposes in the context of Government information services with many staff, as the Taoiseach said in his reply of last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200029#DD00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1513091700,"counter":189,"content":"<p>May I speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200029#DD00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1513091700,"counter":190,"content":"<p>The Deputy is not included but he may come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200029#DD00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1513091700,"counter":191,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's notes will probably tell him that last year his predecessor informed the Seanad that the parliamentary liaison unit had been established as a \"catalyst\" for improved communication between Ministers and Opposition spokespersons and their teams.

Currently, for example, there are 105 Private Members' Bills awaiting Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and 40 awaiting Committee Stage.

In performing this function the unit has been happy to engage with any member of the Opposition, where appropriate.

Minister May most recently on Wednesday, 6 December and again on Thursday, 7 December. <\/p><p>On both occasions we had good conversations as we took stock of the situation that unfolded on Monday, 4 December and the prospects of getting back to a point of satisfactory progress.  I reiterated the firm Irish position regarding the text that had been agreed on Monday, 4 December.<\/p><p>On Friday morning, I was pleased to announce that, following further intensive negotiations, we had reached a satisfactory conclusion which did not involve any change to the guarantee regarding the Border we had secured earlier in the negotiations.  In my statement on Friday, I said we had achieved all we set out to achieve in phase 1 of these negotiations, that we had the assurances and guarantees we needed from the United Kingdom and support for them from the European Union.  I am satisfied sufficient progress has been made on the Irish issues.  The parameters have been set and they are good.<\/p> <p> It remains a matter for the European Council, however, to decide later this week whether it is satisfied to accept the recommendation of the European Commission that sufficient progress has been achieved on all three phase 1 issues.  Assuming that happens, we can move on to the work necessary to convert the commitments made last week into the necessary provisions in the withdrawal agreement, which will be an international agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  We also want to begin discussions about transition arrangements and the new relationship between the EU and the UK in phase 2.<\/p> <p> We will remain fully engaged and vigilant throughout the next period of work.  As I stated last Friday, this is not the end; it is the beginning of the end and there is much to be done in respect of Brexit.  Throughout, we participated in these discussions as part of the EU 27.  I have also spoken with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, on several occasions.  Irish officials were also in contact with the EU task force over the intensive period of negotiations in recent weeks, as well as engaging with other EU institutions like the European Parliament and member states for support.  We were also in bilateral contact with the UK at political and official level.  While these contacts were focused primarily on finding a way forward in the negotiations, the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, and I remain in agreement on the importance of ensuring close ongoing bilateral Ireland-UK relations.  I was not party to any discussions between the UK Prime Minister and the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, MLA, in respect of the EU-UK negotiations, nor did I speak directly with the DUP leader over the course of the intensive negotiation period of the past two weeks.  We last spoke on 12 November.<\/p> <p> The Article 50 process is a negotiation between the EU 27 on the one hand and the UK Government on the other.  As such, it is a process that involves sovereign Governments rather than individual political parties in any of the relevant jurisdictions.  In the same way, neither I nor my officials had a role in any decision made about sharing a draft text with the DUP.  Given the nature of the negotiation structure, that was entirely a matter for the UK Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200029#DD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513092300,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Tomorrow there will be statements on Europe and we can go into the issue in more detail then.  However, as the Council President, Donald Tusk, noted, the first phase was the easy part and those who say the key issues are definitely settled are clearly fooling themselves as there is much work to be done in phase 2.<\/p><p>Does a definition of &quot;frictionless border&quot; exist?  Will the Taoiseach indicate what exactly his definition of a frictionless border is?  Obviously, it involves no physical barriers.  Will it, however, involve no payments or costs of trade?  We know the objective is for there to be no change.  However, if there is change, how much it fits with the Taoiseach's understanding of what is possible?  The UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, and others have spoken about a Canada-plus type of trade agreement.  Where do services stand in all of this?  Merchandise goods are straightforward enough.  What is the outlook for services, as well as for different standards and approaches?<\/p><p>The Taoiseach must acknowledge there are profoundly different views on what the agreement involves, its status and its implications between Dublin and Westminster.  The commitment to an open border is contradicted by the statement that the UK as a whole will leave the customs union and the Single Market.  On Ireland, the agreement states that regulatory alignment will be maintained if there is no overall deal.  If there is no overall deal, however, the UK's membership of both the customs union and the Single Market would automatically lapse, which will include Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>While I accept it is as far as we possibly could get at this particular stage, there are still irreconcilables in the text.  Has the Taoiseach received assurances from Europe as to what happens in such circumstances?  I hope such circumstances do not happen but I believe part of the evidence suggests Britain is heading towards a soft Brexit if it can bring its politics around to that.  That is in the best interests of the British people and Britain itself.<\/p><p>Northern Ireland will also be a topic for statements tomorrow and there is much more to be said.  However, I want to point to statements made by the Taoiseach last Friday and again in the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>that his Government has decided that no Irish Government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind.  I regard that as an offensive comment on many levels.  It suggests the Taoiseach is more eager to promote his Government than respect the consensus that has operated among democratic parties here for 40 years.  I do not believe anyone can look at the enormous effort and political commitment placed by Irish Governments of different parties into Northern Ireland, from the Anglo-Irish Agreement right through to the Good Friday Agreement, and say that they were leaving anybody behind.  At such a moment, it was an offensive comment to make and I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw it.  The Good Friday Agreement and a decade of hard negotiations after it never saw an Irish Government leave Northern nationalists or unionists behind because of parity of esteem.  That is the whole basis on which citizenship emerged in terms of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200030#EE00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1513092300,"counter":226,"content":"<p>We were always Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200030#EE00300","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1513092300,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Yes, but the Good Friday Agreement underpinned the rights of people to Irish citizenship, which in turn underpinned their European citizenship rights, which facilitates what was agreed last Friday.<\/p>  <p>  It could be argued that had the Governments in which the Taoiseach served showed half as much interest in Northern Ireland, then we might not have the deadlock and lack of co-operation we currently have.<\/p>  <p>  In future, will the Taoiseach show a bigger approach to this issue, which used to be defined by the greater recognition of the work of others?  Will he agree that the absence of the Northern Assembly and Executive is causing long-term damage while major cuts in vital services are being implemented?  There has been a deep regression in the rhetoric from London on Northern Ireland.  It is an issue to which the Government and the Oireachtas must pay significant attention.

It contained three levels of safeguards to avoid the so-called \"hard-border\" option.  Obviously, the first two were negotiated and are dependent on the outcome of negotiations.  The third was the so-called \"backstop\" or fall-back position that in the event of there being no agreement, there will be full alignment on the island of Ireland to avoid any reinstatement of the need for customs or any other checks for goods, people or services moving between North and South.<\/p>  <p>  That has been fundamentally resiled from by several members of the British Cabinet since.  We are now told that all the paper is subject to full agreement and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The backstop, accordingly, does not exist, if that interpretation is to stand.  This morning, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's co-ordinator on Brexit, said the comments by the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, in particular, undermined confidence in the trust that the European Parliament can have in the British Government.

In the discussions I had with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in advance of the welcome agreement reached last week, we agreed that on these matters, there could not be what used to be called \"constructive ambiguity\", namely, an agreement of language that we often had in Northern discussions to ensure a slightly different interpretation could be placed to bring everybody along the path.<\/p><p>These are fundamental issues for us and we cannot have either fudge or ambiguity with them.

Anybody who knows Irish history would be particularly worried and, at this time of year, I am sure the Taoiseach may recall the Roman god Janus, the god of openings and beginnings, but also the god that is two-faced.  Looking at Irish history, people are understandably concerned and worried, notwithstanding the subsequent retraction and rather stronger statements in the British House of Commons in the debate when Ms May gave her take on events yesterday.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that this tacking backwards and forwards, in a very long British tradition where Ireland is concerned, is significant, and perhaps understandable?  What does the Taoiseach feel he needs to do tactically and strategically to address that?<\/p>  <p>  There has been a great deal of positive goodwill for Ireland which is very important for future negotiations.  What needs to be done to restore trust in that indication, if not a solid agreement, that the Taoiseach himself said was bulletproof?  What does he want now in the structure of the negotiations which seem like they will only really commence after the meeting in March?  What does he require?  Do we now require a significant and specific Irish presence attached to the Barnier task force?  It is now going to move into the minutiae under a number of key headings of negotiation and while being one of 27 has been a great strength and I have no difficulty with that, we also have to be able to explicitly look after Irish interests and border interests to ensure that there is no hard border.

The issue of whether it is legally binding or simply a statement of intent is still not resolved.  I appreciate the difficulties the Irish Government has had in this negotiation.  Sinn F&eacute;in's experience over many years of negotiating with British Governments and, if I may say so, with Irish Governments, is that agreements reached do not always translate into actions or subsequent legislation.  For example, after almost 20 years, with the Good Friday Agreement turning 20 years old next year, there is still no bill of rights for the North or charter of rights for the island.  This issue of rights is at the heart of the current difficulties.  The refusal by the British Government and by the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, to embrace rights is at the heart of the ongoing difficulties in the Northern Assembly, contrary to the Fianna F&aacute;il leader's untruthful claims about two problem parties.<\/p>  <p>  The letter recently sent by over 200 citizens from civic society in the North, mainly nationalists, to the Taoiseach, identifies these issues and concerns.  The human rights lawyer, Niall Murphy, one of the signatories, identified rights as critical to the future stability of institutions in the North.  He asked why there should be a right in Donegal and not the same right in Derry.  The communiqu&eacute; sheds no light on the future role of the European Court of Justice and in particular the right of European citizens in the North to have access to the courts in the EU.  I first asked this question on Monday a few weeks ago, after the aborted press conference, and the Taoiseach did not answer it.  Will he tell us how he squares the circle of the British Government saying it is going to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, to withdraw from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and to repeal the Human Rights Act when that threatens the very human rights elements and safeguards of the Good Friday Agreement?<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I dislike the term \"Northern nationalist\".  One never hears of western, southern or eastern nationalists but I welcome the Taoiseach's assertion that no Irish Government will ever leave Northern nationalists behind again, not least because it acknowledges since partition the reality of life for most nationalists in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200031#FF00300","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1513092900,"counter":232,"content":"<p>There has been consensus in this House about the need, whatever negotiations and disputes may be happening between the United Kingdom and the European Union, to maintain the position of having no hard border and to get those commitments.  We saw from David Davis' comments that the British Government cannot be fully trusted and the constant repetition of \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\" is still a slightly worrying backdoor out of commitments.  That being said, I think everybody in this House has held fast to the key issue of having no hard border and should continue to do so but the pressure is undoubtedly going to intensify in the second phase as the trade discussions unfold between Britain and the European Union.  We can see that Britain cannot entirely be trusted, given the elements that exist in the Tory party that have a hard Brexit perspective and do not really care about the consequences.<\/p>  <p>  Has the Taoiseach had any indication from the EU about its attitude towards those trade negotiations?  It seems to me that it makes no sense for anybody to have tariff barriers or borders, not just on a North-South basis but on an east-west basis.  I worry, in the same way that there are fairly rotten politics from the Tories, that there is an element in the EU that wants to punish Britain for political reasons and may also be tempted in that regard when it comes to wider negotiations.  We have to say that not only do we want no border between east, north and south, but it does not make any sense for anybody to play politics with getting a good deal which is good for everybody.  That means ensuring we do not have custom barriers, tariff barriers or any other kind of barriers in as far as it is at all possible for everybody's best interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200031#FF00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1513092900,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Many questions have been posed to the Taoiseach and I look forward to receiving the answers.

The joint report agreed by the EU and the UK - Ireland is of course part of the European Union team - was agreed on Friday last.  It is my intention to endorse it in Brussels at the European Council on Thursday.  It is a political agreement so it is more than a statement of intent.  It is politically binding.  As a political agreement, it sets the parameters for the UK withdrawal agreement, which is legally binding.  Therefore, this is a political agreement between the EU on the one hand and the UK on the other.  It informs the content of the UK withdrawal agreement which will be a legally binding international instrument.<\/p><p>It is worth recalling two important sentences from the joint report.  The last sentence in paragraph 43 states: &quot;The United Kingdom also recalls its commitment to the avoidance of a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls.&quot;  That is the definition the EU and UK have made of a hard border - no physical infrastructure, no related checks or controls.  Paragraph 46 states: &quot;[The commitments] are made and must be upheld in all circumstances, irrespective of the nature of any future agreement between the European Union and United Kingdom.&quot;  Therefore these are commitments which must be upheld in all circumstances irrespective of the nature of the final agreement between the EU and the UK.  While people in different places for all sorts of reasons will put their own complexion on what this report means and does not, I will quote from the black and white text because that was hard negotiated and very much defends our position.<\/p><p>However, as I said on Monday, this is not the end; it is only the beginning of the end.  I said on Friday that it would be very important for us as a Government to be fully engaged and vigilant when it comes to phase two.  That involves the withdrawal agreement, phase two, new treaties, the drafting thereof and the ratification thereof.  Brexit is not sorted; it is just starting.  There is a long way to go yet.<\/p><p>If the schedule is adhered to - it may not be but I think it will be - the United Kingdom will leave the European Union in March 2019.  There will then be a transition period for roughly two years.  There will then be a new relationship.  This is something that will go on at least until 2021.  During that period it will require from this Government the same level of engagement and vigilance we have shown in the past year.  It will take a lot of politicians' time, civil service time and Government resources.  However, it is something we have to do and very much intend to do.<\/p><p>I was asked about the EU-UK new relationship, the final status relationship if one likes, after 2021.  I was interested to learn that the United Kingdom Cabinet is meeting this week to consider that and I will be interested to know the outcome of its deliberations as to what the United Kingdom would like to see its new relationship with the EU look like.  Our view is very much that the relationship that exists between the European Union and the UK should be much as it is now.  We never agreed with Brexit as a policy; we do not think it is a good thing.  Therefore, of course, we would like a new status, a new relationship between the EU and the UK, resembling as much as is possible what we have now.  That is very much the position we will feed into in determining the EU position, which has yet to be done.  We will have to agree guidelines for the second phase of negotiations and that has not been done yet.<\/p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct on one level: there will be different views across European capitals on this.  Some people in other European capitals will be less enthusiastic than we are about maintaining the status quo.  We also cannot ignore the fact that they might have a point.  Some of those countries will say it is not right that Britain should continue to have all the benefits of the customs union and all the benefits of the Single Market while leaving it and having none of the responsibilities, costs or obligations.  We have to listen to that argument because that is a fair point.  The European Union will fall apart - or may fall apart - if countries can pick and choose, if they can have the benefits of membership but none of the responsibilities, obligations or costs.<\/p><p>While I absolutely want to retain free trade as it exists now between Britain and Ireland and between Britain and the EU, crucial to making free trade happen within a free-trade bloc is that free trade must be fair.  I do not think we can have unfettered free trade with a neighbouring country or a third country that has lower labour standards, lower health and safety standards, inferior animal welfare standards, reduced environmental standards or engages in state aid.  The European Union happened in the first place to ensure we could have free trade across Europe, but also so that we could have the same harmonised basic and minimum standard to ensure that trade was fair.<\/p><p>These are all things we will have to consider as 27 member states in developing guidelines for the final status agreement.  That is where the whole concept of maintaining full regulatory alignment is at its strongest.  &quot;Maintain&quot; means to keep as it is now, full and not partial alignment, making sure that our rules and regulations are line with each other.  While I have heard some comment on alignment, we sought legal advice from the Attorney General on it.  Alignment is a term used in European law and European treaties.  It is the specific term used in accession treaties.  When countries apply to join the European Union, they have to align their rules and regulations with the <i>acquis communautaire<\/i>, with European law, before they join.  Maintaining full alignment after a country leaves is in many ways something similar but, of course, that is the backstop option and there are two other options as well.<\/p><p>In terms of the ongoing negotiations, as part of the joint report we have agreed that we will retain a dedicated Irish stream throughout phase two because of the unique issues that Ireland faces that have not gone away.  They are still relevant and that is why we have that written into the joint report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200032#GG00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1513093500,"counter":236,"content":"<p>How will that unique stream manifest itself?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200032#GG00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1513093500,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I do not know for certain.

I suspect it will be something on those lines, but I will have an opportunity to meet Mr. Junker, Mr. Tusk and Mr. Barnier at the EPP summit before the Council.  That is one of the things we will discuss there and thereafter also.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin picked up on a remark I made about no future Irish Government leaving Irish citizens in Northern Ireland behind.  Certainly I did not mean any offence by that.  I was not referring to governments that existed in the past 20 years.  Good work was done by the Government of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  Deputy Martin's work as Minister for Foreign Affairs during some of that period was sterling work and something of which he should be very proud.  I was not trying in any way to disparage or make any offensive remarks about any Government in the past 20 years, not least the ones that succeeded in putting together the Good Friday Agreement.  I was making a more historical point, referring to the fact that in the 1920s we were forced to accept partition.  We were weak as a country; we were a fledgling country and had to accept partition.  As a consequence we left behind hundreds of thousands of people who consider themselves to be Irish and were, in fact, then and remain Irish citizens.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by this audit group was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  A range of policies was introduced to ensure an appropriate age profile and levels of fitness, including fixed term contracts for enlisted personnel of certain ranks.  These are kept under review.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, announced last week that he had secured Government approval for an increase in the compulsory retirement age from 65 to 70 for public servants recruited before 1 April 2004.  The uniformed pension accrual group, including garda&iacute;, members of the Permanent Defence Force, fire fighters and prison officers, who are currently required to retire early due to the nature of their work, will not be covered by the new arrangements.

Before 2013, it was factored in that there was a unique situation within the military in the requirement that they require earlier than other public servants.  The Minister of State will be aware that in the Conciliation Council Report, CCR, No. 421, the agreement between the parties noted that the Department of Defence acknowledged that the compulsory early retirement regime applicable to military officers sets their occupation apart from other occupations in the public service, so there is an anomaly.  However, the current position is that the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 does not allow for a supplementary pension for those persons who are forced to retire early.  There is no bridging gap until they get the State pension and they are at a considerable disadvantage if they come in after 2013.

The expectation, therefore, was that this would continue and there were no discussions of any sort with the representative associations to the effect that it would not continue.  Pre-2012 officer entrants had an entitlement to the State pension when they retired but since then the new entrants do not have such an entitlement.  Does the Minister of State not agree that is unfair and is yet another example of the reason the Department is failing to retain officers?  We have a retention issue.

The Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement in March 2017.

The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 October 2017 stood at 9,219, whole-time equivalent, which is 97% of the establishment.<\/p><p>This comprises 7,417 member of the Army, 744 members of the Air Corps and 1,058 members of the Naval Service.  The establishment strength of 9,500 provides for the full staffing of each unit within the Defence Forces organisational structures.  The ratio of strength to establishment for each unit is determined by the extent to which vacancies within the establishment for each unit are filled.  There are vacancies across most units and recruitment efforts are under way to address those vacancies.<br\/><br\/>In this context, personnel deployed from units or engaged in development training should not be confused with vacancies.  Units are maintained in order that personnel can be deployed, not in order to remain fully manned in barracks.  The Defence Forces have always drawn personnel from units for overseas service and other deployments.  Personnel also engage in training on an ongoing basis.  This is to be welcomed and any decisions regarding scaling back on overseas deployments, deployments at home or training will be informed by the advice of the general staff.  I can confirm that I have not received any such advice. <br\/><br\/>Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is, understandably, a significant annual turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces.  However, in recent years the levels of departures have exceeded intakes and this has limited the Defence Forces' ability to meet their establishment strength.  To counteract this, ongoing targeted recruitment has taken place with the objective of returning to, and maintaining, the stated establishment figure of 9,500.<br\/><br\/>As I have previously outlined, there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts, such as those relating to pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-State sector job opportunities.  The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. <br\/><br\/>The number of officers as of 31 October 2017 was 1,056 out of an establishment of 1,233.  The suggestion that there are vacancies in 50% of officer posts in units is clearly at variance with these figures.  The number of cadets in training has substantially increased recently, with approximately 100 cadets having been recruited in each of the years 2016 and 2017.  Approximately 70 cadets will be commissioned as officers in January 2018.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>On foot of issues raised in the climate survey, I have brought forward a White Paper project to examine skills gaps across the Defence Forces.

Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.<br\/><br\/>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake both the home and overseas tasks laid down by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200034#JJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513095300,"counter":278,"content":"<p>My question relates to the number of units in which the strength in station for officers is running at less than 50%.

On the previous occasion on which I put that question to him, like today, he confirmed that the Defence Forces are at 97% of their establishment strength.  Does the Minister of State acknowledge that the Defence Forces establishment only factors in trained personnel and does not account for personnel in training?  They are not the same.

The ordnance unit, that is the bomb disposal unit, has an establishment figure of 21 officers but has eight in station.  One battalion has only five officers out of an establishment figure of 25 in station.  In another, there are seven out of 25 and in one case there is only one fifth of the establishment strength.

They do not have the requisite number of officers.  The engineering corps is operating at 50%, the ordnance unit at 38%, and the transport corps is operating at 20% strength in station.  When the Minister of State is asked the question about the level of officers in each station and references those who are in training or overseas, it does not give us an accurate picture of what is happening.  I am not for a second saying that we should restrict the numbers of those going overseas, in training or undertaking further education.  We need to allow that in order to maintain standards.  However, we also need openness and transparency when it comes to painting the picture of what is happening operationally.

I appreciate the PDF is a priority in the Minister of State's Department, but we can do both at the same time.  We have that capability.  It is not rocket science.  Renewed efforts must be made.  The Reserve Defence Force is meant to have a strength of more than 4,000 but we are now at 1,800, so these are dire straits.

I am very open to that.  I have stated on numerous occasions that if there are people who have specialisations in RDFRA, they should be given the opportunity to go overseas.  This came under the single force concept as well.  However, it is difficult for people to get time off work and so on.  These people are normally in permanent full-time employment and for them to get five or six months off work can be quite difficult at times.  I hope the decisions we made this year on the streamlining of security checks will make a difference for 2018.  It is totally unacceptable that someone wishing to join the Reserve Defence Force is left hanging for five, six, seven, eight or nine months before he or she is notified of the decision as to whether he or she is being taken on, and I have stated this on numerous occasions.

All first-time new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after that date are members of the single scheme.  Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the single scheme pension terms and rules rests with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>The single scheme was one of the key structural fiscal reform commitments agreed by Government with the EU and the IMF in 2010 under the programme of financial support for Ireland.  In the context of the Government's decision to introduce the single scheme, a stated primary objective is to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the long term through reform of the public service pension system.<\/p><p>The new scheme will be fairer, particularly for those on low and moderate earnings and, above all, the public service will be better able to manage the costs associated with the demographic and other changes which are under way.  These policy objectives and the underlying rationale for them were well publicised in advance of the enactment of the 2012 Act.<\/p><p>The terms and rules of the single scheme, however, make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group on or after 1 January 2013.  This position has been confirmed to the PDF representative associations.<\/p><p>However, there are many other established features of the pre-1 January 2013 public service occupational pension schemes that have been discontinued or fundamentally changed under the single scheme.  Among the most notable of these changes is the introduction of career-average pension accrual under the single scheme.  This is in place of the more costly final salary pension accrual applicable in the earlier &quot;pre-existing&quot; public service pension schemes.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>I should also mention that, notwithstanding the distinguishing features of the single scheme, members of the PDF in that scheme retain the minimum pension age of 50 to reflect operational needs, as already applies to new entrant military personnel recruited since April 2004.

We are talking about people retiring - being forced to retire - at, say, 58 or 60, not being able to get their State pension until they are 66 or 67 and then, when they perhaps seek employment to make up the shortfall, are subject to the pension abatement criteria, which are being applied in a completely slapdash manner.  This means that people who have been trained and are highly qualified cannot in essence get jobs in the public sector at present or they will see the value of their pension deducted from their employment.  We therefore have the ridiculous scenario whereby officers and highly skilled people who have left the Army are working in low-pay jobs as shelf-packers in Tesco, where they can keep their pensions, instead of getting jobs in the public sector.

In recent years, the levels of departures have exceeded intakes and this has presented challenges in meeting the establishment strength of 9,500 personnel.  To fill vacancies, there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that approximately 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017.

Joining PESCO does not involve an additional cost to the Exchequer.  Additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in European Defence Agency projects.  As the projects will relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations, such costs would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the allocations for defence announced in the budget means that Ireland&rsquo;s total defence expenditure will increase in real terms over the coming three years.  It is also expected that sharing the costs of capability development across a number of member states should provide for greater economies of scale in terms of overall defence investment expenditure. <\/p><p>PESCO has been presented to the Council by means of a notification.  This notification clearly states that it does not prejudice the security and defence policy of the member states.  The notification also states that the member states remain sovereign and that the commitments will be implemented fully in accordance with the treaty, its protocols and the constitutional provisions of the member states.  As such the budgetary process and role of Oireachtas in determining the Defence Vote remains untouched. <\/p><p>The European Defence Fund, EDF, and PESCO are separate but complementary initiatives.

As PESCO commitments are binding, we have to increase that expenditure.  There is no solace to be had by saying it might have increased anyway because the type of increased expenditure Members would seek are improvements to the pay, conditions and pension entitlements of Defence Forces personnel, not expenditure on a project that is clearly driven by the arms industry across Europe.  It is uncontested that PESCO, along with the European Defence Fund, is driven by arms manufacturers sitting at the heart of the European Commission.

The reductions in pay were on a graduated scale with higher percentages being deducted from those on higher earnings.  This action was one of the measures that it was necessary to take to stabilise the financial situation which faced the country at the beginning of this decade.<\/p>  <p>  The Government appreciates the contribution made by all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, during the economic crisis.  Under public service pay agreements, pay is being restored to public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force.  Successful negotiations with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations have provided for pay increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  These pay increases were weighted in favour of the lower paid.<\/p>  <p>  PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement in March 2017.  The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force.  In addition, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post-1 January 2013 were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017.  Gross annual earnings for this cohort is &euro;27,000, inclusive of military service allowance.  This is a significant increase in pay, which was approximately &euro;21,800 per annum prior to this agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Family income supplement provides a means to supplement a family&rsquo;s income, be its members employed in the public or private sector, having regard to combined family income and the number of dependent children.  Pay levels in the public service, including the Defence Forces, are determined on an individual basis and are not weighted in accordance with family circumstances.  Going forward, there is potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The public service stability agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.

Real hardship has been inflicted on these people.  There is a need for them to get an improvement in pay and conditions.  They do not want to have their spouses or partners out on the streets.  They want to be rewarded for the work they do in a very professional way.

Similar recruitment campaigns are being planned for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined, there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts, such as pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians.

I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.  I am aware of his concern regarding the Traveller community and his commitment to trying to progress issues.<\/p>  <p>  There was a big occasion in the House earlier this year when Travellers were declared an ethnically distinct group in our society.  The real question is whether this will translate into a change in their status and well-being.  The Traveller community survey that was carried out is extremely informative.  It shows the serious challenges faced by the Traveller community.  I compliment the Traveller organisations and the Community Foundation for Ireland for commissioning this analysis.  It follows many other analyses.  I recall a study carried out, as part of a far bigger analysis of social attitudes, by an tAthair Miche&aacute;l MacGr&eacute;il in which he tracked this issue over many decades.  The standing of many groups changes but, as he said at the time, the standing of Travellers is the great apartheid in Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  The highlights from the survey are quite scary.  Some 62% said that accommodation issues are worse than they were five years ago and 72% said that mental health issues are worse than they were five years ago.  Unemployment, at 50%, is worse than five years ago.  The survey states that 60% are not working but when one adds to that the number who are on schemes or in Traveller community work, we find that it is over 90%.  This means only 10% are in commercial employment.  More seriously, 0% of Travellers are in State employment.  This is an issue I tried to deal with when I served as a Minister.  We looked at ways of ensuring that people from the Traveller community would be brought into the public service.  Another pertinent factor is the fact that only 30% of Travellers who get training end up in employment.  That is a very low progression rate.<\/p>  <p>  Some 36% of Travellers state that they have very poor health, which is way above the national average.  We are aware of the suicide rate and, in particular, there is a high rate of mental health issues among men, as well as low self-esteem.  Unfortunately, 48% say that they have experienced discrimination at the hands of the Garda and 25% say they have experienced it with housing authorities.  Unlike their counterparts in the settled community, a very high percentage of Travellers must interact with housing authorities for public housing.  A much higher percentage of the rest of the community provides its own housing and would not have day-to-day contact with housing authorities.  The figure in respect of pub staff, shop staff and so forth is approximately 30%.  A figure that those of us who work consistently with Travellers can testify to is the 90% who say that they have been the subject of discrimination by the public at large at some time in their lives.  It is interesting that, in this survey and the one last year, the figure for Connacht-Ulster is 10% to 20% lower, which shows there is more social acceptance in that province.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200043#SS00600","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1513100100,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for raising this important matter.  We both acknowledge that the Traveller Community National Survey is a timely and valuable resource.  I have read it a number of times.  It covers a range of important issues affecting the Traveller community.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, last June I launched the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy for the period from 2017 to 2021.  I am sure the Deputy has a copy of it.  If he does not, I will arrange for a copy to be sent to him.  The steering group, which I chair, was established to oversee the development and implementation of the strategy.  This group is made up of officials representing relevant Departments and agencies, as well as representatives from the national Traveller non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  The strategy contains ten themes.  Grouped under these, 149 actions were identified as necessary to help to advance the betterment of the lives of Travellers and Roma in Ireland.  To date, work has begun on approximately 100 of the actions.  Accommodation is highlighted as a priority for Travellers in both the strategy and the survey.  The 2018 capital provision for Traveller-specific accommodation is &euro;12 million, an increase of &euro;3 million on 2017.  Further funding may be considered throughout the year, also on a case-by-case basis, in light of progress across the programme generally.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding education, the national strategy contains 14 key education-related actions.  While improvements on education outcomes for Travellers as opposed to five years ago are reflected in the 2017 national survey, I am well aware that much more needs to be done, and is being done, in this regard.  In fact, a sub-committee of the national strategy steering group has been established to deal with the issue of retention of Traveller and Roma children in education.  At its most recent meeting, a proposal was jointly agreed by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla to implement a pilot project on this issue in four locations with high Traveller and-or Roma populations.  Tusla's education welfare service, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Service, the school completion programme and the home-school community liaison scheme, are key supports for Traveller children.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Department of Education and Skills published the DEIS Plan 2017.  The plan includes specific actions relating to Traveller and Roma education to promote improvements in school attendance and completion.  It should be noted that the Department of Education and Skills continues to provide a number of specific additional resources to support Traveller and Roma children in the school system, including: 141 alleviation resource teacher posts for schools with significant numbers of Travellers and Roma at a cost of &euro;8.46 million; and additional pupil capitation for Travellers and Roma, at a rate of &euro;70 per pupil for primary level and &euro;201 per pupil for post-primary level, at a cost of &euro;1.11 million.<\/p>  <p>  The outcome of the first strand of the programme for access to higher education, PATH, funding was announced by the Minister for Education and Skills in April 2017 and &euro;2.7 million will be allocated through PATH 1 over the next three years to support initiatives by centres of teaching excellence to increase diversity in the teaching profession.  Through the PATH 2 1916 bursaries fund, &euro;6 million will be invested in bursaries for students from target groups, including Travellers, over the next three years.  Each bursary will be worth &euro;5,000 per year and may be held in addition to a Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant.  The PATH 3 higher education access fund is intended to support regional clusters of higher education institutions to attract 2,000 additional students, full-time or part-time, from groups currently under-represented in higher education, including Travellers.  A total of &euro;7.5 million will be allocated over the next three years through the PATH 3 fund.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to access to employment, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operates a wide range of employment supports.  While, in general, the Department's measures are available to Travellers on the same basis as the rest of the population, community employment has special provision for members of the Traveller community.<\/p>  <p>  Traveller health is also a priority area under the national strategy.  Examples of targeted support programmes include funding of a range of Traveller agencies and groups to implement priority programmes and actions via service level agreements, such as primary health care projects, counselling services, family support programmes, men's health projects and so forth.  In addition to funding to agencies for the delivery of Traveller health programmes, the HSE employs a number of public health nurses and related staff to address priority health needs of members of the Traveller community.  In addition, the National Office for Suicide Prevention funds Exchange House Ireland to address the mental health promotion and suicide prevention needs of the Traveller community.  Nine mental health service co-ordinators are currently being recruited by the mental health division of the HSE with the aim of driving, managing and supporting implementation of agreed Traveller programmes and actions in respect of Traveller mental health.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has allocated approximately &euro;500,000 to support several projects specific to Travellers nationwide on the basis of proposals received from local authorities regarding developing facilities for the urban Traveller horse population.<\/p>  <p>  A great deal more is being done, and it needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200043#SS00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1513100100,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  In the limited time available, I wish to focus on two important issues.  The first is that we provide money for Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p><p>The problem is that under our current system, we can bring the horse to water but we cannot make it drink.  The reality is that in many local authority areas, including one very close to me, the local authority is not drawing the money down despite it being available and is not making the hard decisions because there is local opposition.  It is very hard to get a Part 8 and where it involves voluntary housing, they stop it because they will not sell the land.  <\/p> <p> One thing that could be done in 2018 is to change the law if necessary to take responsibility for making decisions about Traveller-specific housing away from local authority members and give it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where most issues wind up anyway.  The Minister of State knows that when it involves the local authority, the reality is that members must vote and that just does not happen in some local authorities.  It is non-functional.<\/p> <p> The other issue is employment.  It is interesting when we look at education because it is one place where significant improvement was made between 2000 and 2017.   The percentage of those with the junior certificate has gone from 9% to 39% while the percentage with the leaving certificate has gone from virtually 0% to 16%.  The percentage at third level is 5% between postgraduate, undergraduate degree, diploma and other third level.  That is a great improvement from nothing.  It is small but it is an improvement.  However, we are not translating that into the workplace.  The State should ensure that quotas are put aside to ensure that Travellers are incorporated in the public service and Civil Service.  The social change that would bring about would be immense because the more we integrate people into the mainframe of society, the more the pace of change will accelerate, everybody will have a better life and the community will feel more included in Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200043#SS00800","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513100700,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Deputy's point that the recognition last March by the Government and indeed by all parties here of Travellers as an ethnic minority represented a crucial step forward in the relationship between the Government, the Traveller community and the settled community.  It is my aim that the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy will build on this landmark decision and we will work to bring about concrete improvements in the lives of Travellers across the country.  The national strategy is a work in progress.  I ask everybody to support and become aware of it to ensure it works.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I note the Deputy's understandable concerns about the issues affecting the Traveller community, which have been covered by this survey.  My Department and I are ensuring that progress continues to be made regarding tackling each of the areas of concern raised in the national Traveller community survey.  Implementing the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy is a key objective of mine in co-operation with other key stakeholders.  Again, I ask councillors around the country to row in behind this strategy and support it.  They have a responsibility as councillors to do that.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with the objectives of the national strategy, the programme that is of real benefit to Travellers is the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which has the aim of reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  The SICAP funding allocation for front-line delivery for 2017 is &euro;37.5 million, which includes an allocation of &euro;3 million under the European Social Fund's programme for employability, inclusion and learning programme 2014-20.  It is a key priority of Government and as a key intervention for the hard to reach in society, the Deputy will be pleased to know that the programme's target groups include Travellers in particular.  From 1 January to 21 March 2017, SICAP supported 22,105 individuals, of which 385 self-identified as Irish Travellers with 147 local community groups supported under SICAP where Travellers are a named target group.  <\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy's desire for more Travellers to be included and employed by the State, including Government Departments.  Again, this is also part of the strategy.  The strategy is very new, having been launched in June.  I look forward to everybody supporting it and working through it.  Everybody agrees that the challenges are enormous.  There is a lot to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200044#TT00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","time":1513100700,"counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200044#TT00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1513100700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and other Members of the House for facilitating this debate.

They look after them at home but when they need urgent care and respite, it is not available in County Louth.  I know a recent edition of \"Prime Time\" identified what we need to do.

I also thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the provision of respite services in County Louth.  Let me make it clear at the outset that the Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.<\/p><p>We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives.  In recent months, I have spoken to many people with disabilities and their families and carers.  The same point has been raised again and again on the absolutely urgent need for increased respite care throughout the country.  I accept it as a valid argument and that is why I appeared on \"Prime Time\" last week to face the music and deal with the issue.  I have made it very clear to my colleagues in government and after much discussion, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and I have secured an additional &euro;10 million for the HSE, specifically to enhance respite care in the disability sector.  We agreed that extra &euro;10 million at Cabinet.<\/p> <p> Many people with disabilities are being cared for by very elderly parents who are finding it very hard to cope.  Other carers simply do not have the hours in the day to look after other members of their families and, just as importantly, their own health and well-being.  The full details of the services to be provided with the additional &euro;10 million will be contained in the HSE&rsquo;s detailed operational plan.  I have made it clear that this money must be ring-fenced for respite services within the disability sector and that it must be targeted at those who are most in need.  I am pleased to inform the House that &euro;8 million will be provided for nine new dedicated houses for respite in each community health area, plus an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite in this area.  These additional 12 respite houses will provide approximately 19,000 respite nights yearly to the people living in those areas.  In addition, a further &euro;2 million extra funding will be used for innovative respite solutions, such as home sharing and extended day services, to provide assistance where people need it most.  I will be keeping a very close eye on how this additional funding is put to work and I will be requiring the HSE to give the utmost priority to putting these new facilities and services in place without delay.<\/p> <p> I accept that the provision of respite services has come under additional pressure in the past number of years.  More children and adults are now seeking access to respite and the changing needs of people with a disability are also having an impact, as they, along with the rest of the population, live longer lives.  A Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the need for respite services to be developed further and I am fully committed to ensuring this happens.<\/p> <p> In the context of respite services in County Louth, discussions are ongoing at CHO area 8 level regarding the emerging need for additional respite services and the options to be developed to meet these needs.  The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available.  The additional funding I have announced today will include the development of respite services in CHO area 8, including County Louth.  The officials in CHO area 8 are familiar with the TaIbot Bower House proposal for respite services.  Scoping out the most efficient way of commissioning respite services with this new money will be an immediate priority for the HSE to ensure services are brought on stream without delay.  The Deputies will appreciate that any proposals can only be considered within the funding available to the HSE and must adhere to a rigorous procurement process.<\/p> <p> I warmly welcome the extra &euro;10 million for respite services because it is urgently required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200044#TT00600","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513101300,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State's announcement.

I welcome his commitment to the allocation of &euro;10 million and his commitment to make sure one of these facilities will be based in Louth.  Further to that, it is most important that with the age profile of families and the growing numbers who will need these services that we continue to enhance them in the years to come.  With that in mind, the issue of the funding of the St. John of God in Drumcar, which came to almost &euro;32 million, needs to be examined in terms of whether we are getting value for money in delivering those services.

There is nothing reasonable about a person bringing a family member to a house in the middle of the night, only to be refused entry and having to go to an acute hospital instead to take up an acute bed with a security person outside the door and all sorts of other issues.

I am very much aware of the importance of access to planned respite which ensures that people with disabilities receive opportunities to socialise separately.  It facilitates families having a break from caring because it is very difficult.  Respite services may vary according to the excess needs of the individuals and their carer.  The model of respite is changing and although some require overnight respite, others prefer to benefit from day respite.  The number of overnight respite places has been reducing as persons with disabilities seek alternative models such as day respite or extended day care.  We will also look at those areas.  For example, 42,552 day respite services were provided in 2017.  Personally, and throughout my political career, I have always advocated for the rights of people with disabilities.  I understand and acknowledge the value and importance of respite care for people with disabilities and their families.  I hope this funding will enable people to get a well-deserved break and to maintain their own health and well-being.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, I will keep a very close eye on how the additional funding is put to work.  I will require the HSE to give the utmost priority to putting these new facilities and services in place without delay because it is a very important part of our disability services.  We put &euro;1.763 billion into the social care plan in 2017 and we have to ensure it goes to people with disabilities and their families and carers.  That is where our priority should be.  The 2017 plan deals with 5,720 people with a disability who avail of day-based respite services.  We have another 2,500 who avail of respite services, such as holiday respite or occasional respite and we also have other respite services.  We have 128 new emergency residential places, which is a priority issue for me.<\/p>  <p>  I thank my colleagues for their support.  We will fight on and develop the services but above all the services will operate in the interests of the person with the disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200045#UU00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Recruitment","time":1513101300,"counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200045#UU00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1513101300,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I want to address the lack of psychologists in our health service.  Often when I or other Deputies highlight service gaps in mental health services provision or the fact that CAMHS staffing levels are barely more than half that recommended in A Vision for Change, the response by the Government is to cite difficulties in recruitment as a key cause of the difficulties.<\/p><p>However, some of these difficulties could well be self-inflicted.  I am speaking in particular to the recruitment of psychologists by the HSE.  There has been an issue with this for a number of years especially related to whether they were clinical or counselling psychologists.  In 2009 the HSE established a working group of psychology managers to review recruitment procedures for psychologists.  Criteria were developed that clearly favoured clinical psychologists for employment in the HSE.  Counselling psychologists were deemed eligible to work with only one care group despite already working in the areas from which they were suddenly deemed ineligible.<\/p> <p> As a consequence of this, counselling psychologists were excluded entirely from child and adolescent mental health, CAMH, services between 2009 and June 2016.  A review process was conducted resulting in some progress being made with regard to the opening up in principle of HSE posts to psychologists other than clinical psychologists.  Ultimately it made some helpful and some unhelpful recommendations.  The major concern is the stipulation that psychologists who have completed training programmes that do not map neatly to specific criteria around placements were deemed as ineligible for particular care areas in 2016 and 2017 recruitment campaigns and could potentially never be able to work in the HSE after October 2019.<\/p> <p> The effect of the recommendations in the period since the issuing of the report has been that trainee psychologists other than trainee clinical psychologists do not know whether they will be eligible to work in the HSE after they graduate.  They may be faced with an effective lifetime ban on working in the HSE if the October 2019 stipulation stands.<\/p> <p> After the issuing of the review report in June 2016, the HSE convened an implementation group to look at the issue emerging from the report but it seems its terms of reference were extremely narrow.  The report of that group was, as I understand it, issued in June 2017 but remained with the national director and was not released until 22 November 2017 despite repeated requests from multiple interested stakeholders.  Trinity College Dublin has sought and is still seeking a response from the HSE about the problems that are being caused for the current doctorate in counselling psychology programme.  IMPACT and the Psychological Society of Ireland have made attempts to engage with the HSE but the executive has still not responded.<\/p> <p> The exclusionary recruitment practices used by the HSE for psychologists do not exist in other countries, including the United Kingdom.  Its practices are also in direct contravention of the recruitment policy of the Psychological Society of Ireland.  As long as the HSE continues to make inadequate use of high-quality psychologists because of its demonstrated preference for clinical psychologists only, will we not continue to face what the HSE terms recruitment challenges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200045#UU00600","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513101900,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, sends his apologies.  I have a particular interest in the area of psychology and I keep a close eye on it in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me the opportunity to set out the current criteria and practices for recruiting HSE psychologists.  Over the years, there have been ongoing issues with the eligibility criteria for recruitment to HSE psychologist positions.  In particular, a change to the eligibility criteria in 2009 made it more difficult for counselling and educational psychologists to obtain employment in the HSE.  This change led to the development of eight care groups.  Clinical psychologists were eligible for employment in all eight care groups.  Counselling and educational psychologists were eligible for employment in one of these care groups.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address these issues, a review commenced in 2015 to examine the eligibility criteria and to make recommendations.  The purpose for the review was to ensure the availability of a good supply of candidates with the appropriate skills and experience to meet the needs of service users.  The 2016 report of the review group made a number of recommendations, which were accepted.  It recommended revised eligibility for entry into competitions for psychology posts, both at basic and senior level.  The review group also recommended that the number of care group areas be reduced from eight care groups to four.<\/p>  <p>  It also recommended changes in eligibility.  These changes mean that counselling psychologists are now eligible to apply for psychologist positions in all four care group areas.  Educational psychologists are eligible for two.  The HSE advises that the new care group criteria have been implemented since 1 March 2016 and applied to basic grade and senior psychology competitions held throughout 2016 and 2017.  In addition, the review group also looked at the qualification requirements.  It has recommended a broadening of these requirements.  Instead of named psychology qualifications only, eligibility will be made up of a combination of qualifications and placement or supervised work experience.<\/p>  <p>  An implementation group, chaired by an independent chairperson, has been established to map out the practical steps necessary to implement the revised eligibility requirements.  On conclusion of its work, I am advised that the implementation group submitted its report and recommendations to the HSE leadership team for consideration.  After its consideration, the HSE accepted all the recommendations in full.  I understand that the implementation date has been deferred, for operational reasons, until October 2019.  This means that the current criteria for placements remain in effect until then.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that four of the other recommendations made by the implementation group can be implemented without delay.  One of these is the formation of a group composed of recruitment managers and principal psychology managers.  This group will consider any new definitions to be used in advance of recruitment competitions.  It will also deal with unforeseen or difficult decisions that may arise during competitions.  This will ensure that fairness and consistency can be protected.<\/p>  <p>  Another important recommendation approved by the leadership team is the creation of a national psychology placement office.  In order to prepare for this, a project team will be established to advance this recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations as outlined will significantly improve the role of the psychology services in supporting vulnerable service users and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200046#VV00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1513101900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned the placement criteria several times.  The concern is that the HSE may be trying to compel a large number of existing employees to complete very extensive in-service training in order to maintain eligibility for their own jobs for promotion or transfer.  This would severely affect service capacity and the opportunity for service development, as well as the career opportunities available to those employees.  It is likely that this will not apply to clinical psychologist employees but only to counselling and educational psychologists.  There is no clear rationale for the requirement other than an attempt to implement criteria which have already been shown to lead to multiple problems.<\/p><p>IMPACT has notified the HSE of this numerous times but it has failed to account for it.  There are no such requirements, for example, for counselling psychologists employed in the NHS in the UK.  The bottom line is that although the recent report is positive in tone, the threat of placements not being recognised and thus graduates being ineligible still stands as the new definitions of appropriate placement are potentially as ambiguous as in the past and could be used to exclude some graduates on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, as has occurred in the past.  As written, they seem to exclude HSE adult primary care services.  We still urgently need somebody in the HSE with authority to pre-approve a placement as eligible and help to secure such a placement.

Members do not get many opportunities to make a case on significant issues of health in their own counties and when they do, they like to ask questions and tease out issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, however, will only be able to read a script on this issue.  That is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Eighteen thousand patients visited the emergency department in Navan hospital in the past year, with 5,500 of those staying overnight in the medical unit in the hospital.  Those figures are increasing.  Our hospital is a great hospital and we have great staff in Meath.  It has proven to be successful in reducing the length of time patients have to stay in the hospital and it has also been successful in reducing the level of readmissions to our hospital.  It is one of the best hospitals in the country for dealing with people who have had heart attacks and strokes.  It has also taken on a massive amount of new elective surgery from the Mater Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital serves the whole of the county of Meath, which has a population that is growing radically.  When I was a child, approximately 100,000 people lived in County Meath.  There are now 200,000 of us and quarter of a million people will be living in the county within the next 20 years, making it one of the most populous counties in the country by far.<\/p>  <p>  Not all the news is good, however.  Last September, we saw the near collapse of the accident and emergency department in County Meath due to unofficial industrial action by agency doctors.  Navan is more exposed than any other hospital to agency doctors and to this type of strike action because all of the doctors in the accident and emergency department are agency doctors.  That means that the HSE does not want to give a full, decent contract to doctors working in the accident and emergency department in Navan because it does not expect there to be an accident and emergency department in Navan for long.  Also, I have asked the Minister, Deputy Harris, a number of times by way of parliamentary questions the number of agency doctors and other agency staff working within the health service and I have been told by his Department that it does not know, which is a shocking indictment in terms of the way that service is being currently managed.<\/p>  <p>  Navan used to have a great record with regard to trolley counts.  It used to have one of the lowest trolley counts in the country.  From January to the beginning of November this year, more than 2,200 people have been on trolleys in Navan.  The numbers on trolleys have quadrupled in the space of one year.  Why has that happened?  Why is it the case that there are four times more people on trolleys so far this year than in the entirety of last year?  What does the Minister of State intend to do about that?  If a situation arises where there are delayed diagnoses there will be delayed treatment and if there is delayed treatment, there will be sub-optimum outcomes for patients, which is not good enough.  I imagine one of the reasons for that is the fact that on a given day this year there were 20 people in Navan hospital who were clinically discharged, that is, 20 people for whom the doctors could do no more but who had nowhere else to go within the health service.  Their pathway to further treatment was blocked.  There are two State nursing homes in Meath and both of them have equally as many people waiting to get into them as are residents.  It means that many people are in hospital beds in Navan because they have nowhere else to go.  That is reducing the opportunity for people to access decent accident and emergency health services in County Meath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200047#WW00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1513102500,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200047#WW00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1513102500,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I first apologise for the Minister, Deputy Harris.

I strongly take his views on board.  I am grateful to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for giving me the opportunity to update the House on accident and emergency services in County Meath.  Tackling the challenges in emergency departments generally is a key commitment of the Government and I am delighted that &euro;40 million in additional funding has been made available in 2017 as part of the 2018 budget to address winter pressures and waiting lists.  That funding will be aimed at reducing overcrowding in our hospitals in this period through the provision of extra capacity and additional supports.<\/p>  <p>  Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan provides a general acute hospital service to the catchment area of Meath and currently provides accident and emergency services in County Meath.  Since 2013, the hospital has been part of the Ireland East Hospital Group.  Every hospital in that group, large or small, has a vital role to play, with the smaller hospitals such as Navan managing routine, urgent or planned care locally, while more complex care is managed in the larger hospitals and with better linkages with primary, continuing and social care.  As a smaller hospital, the challenge is to make sure that Navan provides more of the right type of services for the people of Meath, which can be safely be delivered in order that we maximise the benefit to all patients.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the hospital continues to play a significant role in the Ireland East Hospital Group in providing sustainable, safe and effective care at the appropriate level of complexity, a number of developments already have been funded at Navan hospital in recent years.  In addition to the refurbishment of the emergency department, there has been an upgrade of general theatres, an upgrade of the sterile services unit, the addition of new end-of-life care family rooms and a garden within the hospital, as well as an allocation of capital funding of &euro;755,000 for the replacement of various equipment.  There has also been an increase in day surgical activity, with surgeons from the Mater Hospital carrying out day surgery in Navan.  Further developments regarding surgery and other clinical services at Navan are being considered by Ireland East Hospital Group.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that there are no immediate plans to change the current emergency service configuration of services at Navan.  The Ireland East Hospital Group is engaged in a programme of redesign work to further integrate and enhance the role of Navan hospital as a constituent hospital within the hospital group.  The hospital group is continuing to engage closely with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff and the local and wider community are addressed.  Any changes to the emergency department services in Meath would only occur following consultation with key stakeholders, including health professionals at the hospital and other hospitals in the hospital groups, the National Ambulance Service, and community and public representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200047#WW00500","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1513102500,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The Minister talks about creating extra resources within the health service but the small hospital framework document states that Our Lady's Hospital will lose accident and emergency, intensive care and coronary care services, as well as 24-hour anaesthesia.

We have a situation where redesign effectively means the downgrading of a level 3 hospital to a level 2 hospital.

I notice a group of my neighbours from south Kilkenny in the Public Gallery and I acknowledge their presence.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Electoral (Amendment) (D&aacute;il Constituencies) Bill 2017 is to provide for the number of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and for the revision of constituencies and the number of members to be elected for such constituencies in light of the results of census 2016.  It also provides for an amendment of the Electoral Act 1997.  In broad terms, the Bill provides for the total number of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to be 160 and for the number of constituencies to be 39 in accordance with the recommendations contained in the Constituency Commission Report 2017.  In debating and deciding upon this Bill, the Oireachtas will meet its constitutional obligation to review and revise constituencies with due regard to population changes and distribution around the country.  To support the Oireachtas in this task, the Electoral Act 1997 provides for the establishment of an independent Constituency Commission and for that commission to report to the Ceann Comhairle on the conclusion of its work.  The most recent commission reported to the Ceann Comhairle on 27 June 2017.  Since the report&rsquo;s publication, the Government has given due consideration to the recommendations of the commission and, in accordance with accepted practice since 1980, has agreed to implement those recommendations in full and without change.  The Bill now before the House provides for this.<\/p><p>Our Constitution sets out, clearly and distinctly, the overarching requirements that apply to the membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In addition, and complementary to these constitutional provisions, Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 provides for a constituency review following each census of population and establishes, among other things, the terms of reference of a Constituency Commission.  By way of summary, the following constitutional provisions are of particular note.  The provisions principally relate to Article 16 of the Constitution.  Article 16.2.2<sup>o<\/sup>states, &quot;The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.&quot;  Article 16.2.3<sup>o<\/sup>provides that, &ldquo;The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the some throughout the country.&quot;  Article 16.2.4<sup>o<\/sup>states that, &quot;The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population&quot;. <\/p><p>In effect, these constitutional provisions require that D&aacute;il constituencies be revised whenever population change, as ascertained in a census, leads to population to member ratios in individual constituencies that are significantly out of line with the national average or the limits set in the Constitution of one member to every 20,000 to 30,000 of population.  It has been four years since the constituencies were last reviewed, by way of the Electoral (Amendment) (D&aacute;il Constituencies) Act 2013, which gave legal effect to the recommendations in the Constituency Commission Report 2012, which was, in turn, completed following census 2011.  The results of census 2016 show a 3.8% increase in population since 2011 distributed unevenly across the country but largely on the eastern seaboard.  The population is such now that the ratio of members to population, at 30,138, is outside the constitutional limit of 1 to 30,000.  While this does not make the composition of the 31st D&aacute;il unconstitutional, since it was formed on the basis of total numbers set with reference to census 2011, there is now an imperative to legislate for revised D&aacute;il constituencies to bring them into line with the requirements of Article 16.2 of the Constitution in good time for the next election, whenever that happens.<\/p><p>  These constitutional provisions were considered by the courts in two cases in 1961, the High Court case of John O&rsquo;Donovan <i>v<\/i>. The Attorney General, and the Supreme Court reference case relating to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1961. They were considered again in the High Court case taken by Deputies Finian McGrath and Catherine Murphy in 2007 where it was argued that the constituencies on which the general election was being fought at that time did not comply with the requirements in Article 16 of the Constitution.  In his judgment of 2007 in the latter case, Mr. Justice Clarke stated that he was satisfied that there is an &quot;urgent burden&quot; on the Oireachtas to review constituencies following a census.  In effect, he concluded that the Oireachtas must act promptly to bring constituencies In line with population once a census reveals significant population change.  The progression of the proposed Bill will now allow the Oireachtas to so act on this occasion.<\/p><p>Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 provides for the review of D&aacute;il and European constituencies by an independent Constituency Commission, upon the publication of the census report setting out the preliminary census results.  The terms of reference of the commission are specified in the Act.  These provisions are, of course, subordinate to the constitutional requirements set out in Article 16.2.  Following publication of the preliminary census results on 14 July 2016, a Constituency Commission was established to begin work on the review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies and to report with recommendations.  This was the fifth commission established under the 1997 Act.  It was also the second statutory commission established with authority to commence work upon the publication of preliminary census results.  This provision was in response to the High Court case taken by Deputies Finian McGrath and Catherine Murphy in 2007.<\/p><p>Final results for census 2016 were published on 6 April 2017, with the Constituency Commission Report 2017 subsequently finalised and presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 27 June 2017.  The report was also laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on that date.  The Constituency Commission recommended that the number of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann should be 160.  This figure gives a ratio of one member to every 29,762 of population, which is quite close to the constitutional limit of one to every 30,000.  While this is the highest ever ratio in the State, it is within the constitutional limit and, in recommending this figure, the Constituency Commission had regard to the maximum number permitted under section 6(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997.  The Commission also recommended that there should be 39 constituencies.<\/p><p>It was recommended that 18 constituencies remain unchanged from the previous review completed in 2011.<\/p> <p> The report of the Central Statistics Office on the final results of census 2016 showed the total population of the State to be 4,761,865, an increase of 173,613 people or 3.8% in the population since April 2011.  The majority of that change was on the eastern side of the country.  The commission had three months after the publication of those results within which to complete its work and report to the Ceann Comhairle with its recommendations.  The report of the Constituency Commission was presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 27 June 2017 and was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the same date.  In addition, copies were circulated to Members and the report was published on the website of the Constituency Commission.<\/p> <p> By now I am sure that all Members are familiar with its content and its recommendations, but for the information of Deputies and the record of the House, I will outline the main features of the commission&rsquo;s report on D&aacute;il and European constituencies.  The commission recommends that the number of Members of the D&aacute;il should be 160.  This is the maximum number permitted under section 6(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997 and provides for a Member to population ratio of 1:29,762.  The commission recommended that there should be 13 five-seat constituencies, up from the current 11; some 17 four-seat constituencies, one more than at present; and nine three-seat constituencies, four fewer than at present.  This gives a total of 39 constituencies, one less than at present.<\/p> <p> The commission recommended that 18 constituencies should remain unchanged.  These are, as listed in the commission report, Dublin Bay South, Dublin Fingal, Dublin South-Central, Dublin Mid-West, Dublin South-West, Dublin West, Meath West, Louth, Longford-Westmeath, Donegal, Cork East, Cork North-Central, Cork North-West, Cork South-Central, Cork South-West, Kerry, Waterford and Wexford.<\/p> <p> Prior to arriving at its recommendations, the commission reported that it gave consideration to the possibilities of adhering to county boundaries in the drawing up of new constituency boundaries.  However, the analysis showed that in many cases breaches to county boundaries would be unavoidable, having regard to the uneven distribution of population and to the constitutional requirement in Article 16.2 that the ratio of population to the number of Members should, as far as practicable, be the same throughout the country.  In particular, the constitutional requirements could not be fully met at the two points in the range - 159 and 160 members - available to the commission under its terms of reference by adhering to county boundaries alone.<\/p> <p> To minimise the number of breaches to county boundaries, the commission did, however, adhere to the views and practice of previous commissions in joining two entire counties into a single constituency in respect of Carlow-Kilkenny, Sligo-Leitrim and Cavan-Monaghan.  Nevertheless, new breaches of county boundaries were considered necessary in Laois, Meath, Offaly, Roscommon and Tipperary while some breaches already in place by virtue of existing D&aacute;il constituency boundaries have been retained.<\/p> <p> Overall, the commission reported that it was satisfied, in the light of the constitutional requirements and its terms of reference, that the recommended constituencies meet the constitutional requirements from the point of view of equality of representation.  The commission has recommended changes to constituencies in the following areas.  It recommends that Dublin Central become a four-seat constituency, with four electoral divisions comprising a population of 12,394 transferred in from Dublin North-West and one electoral division with a population of 5,064 also being transferred in from Dublin Bay North.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire is to be revised to include part of the electoral division of Glencullen, which has a population of 1,535, which will be taken from Dublin Rathdown.  This would improve the balance between the variances in these two constituencies and would comprise the entire administrative area of the local council.<\/p> <p> The commission recommends that the Cavan-Monaghan constituency be revised to include the 36 electoral divisions of County Cavan, comprising a total population of 13,150, that are currently in the existing Sligo-Leitrim constituency and that seven electoral divisions comprising a population of 3,973 be transferred from Meath East.  This ensures that all of County Cavan will be included in the new Cavan-Monaghan constituency which will become a five-seat constituency.<\/p> <p> Sligo-Leitrim is to have 18 electoral divisions, representing a total population of 7,806 transferred in from the north of County Roscommon, around Boyle and west of Carrick-on-Shannon, from the Roscommon-Galway constituency.  Roscommon-Galway is to receive the transfer of a population of 8,650 from Galway East while Galway East itself is to be revised to include an additional population of 4,547 from Galway West.  It is recommended that the Mayo constituency receive the transfer of the population of 4,893 from that part of County Mayo located in the existing Galway West constituency.  This reduces the size of the county boundary breach in Mayo.<\/p> <p> The Clare constituency is to be revised to include the electoral division of Ballyglass, which has a population of 5,994 and which is currently in the Limerick City constituency.  This will restore the county boundary in Clare.  The Tipperary constituency is to receive the transfer of 10,847 population from that part of Tipperary that is currently in the existing Offaly constituency.  This will restore the county boundary in that part of Tipperary.  However, a transfer of a population of 4,375 from three electoral divisions in Tipperary to Limerick City is recommended to avoid a high variance in the population to Member ratio in the Tipperary constituency.  This will create a new county boundary breach in that area - around Newport as I understand it.  It is recommended that the Limerick constituency receive the transfer of a population of 2,008 from Limerick City to address the high variance in the Limerick constituency area and to better balance the ratios between the two constituencies.<\/p> <p> It is recommended that Laois and Offaly become a single five-seat constituency similar to the arrangements which were in place from 1923 to 2013.  However, to avoid a high variance, a population of 11,854 will need to move to the Kildare South constituency.  Kildare South is to become a four-seat constituency with the transfer of a population of 7,892 from that part of Kildare that is currently in the existing Laois constituency and a further 3,226 from the constituency of Kildare North.  These transfers will ensure that there is no longer a breach to the Kildare county boundary.<\/p> <p> It is recommended that Carlow-Kilkenny receive the transfer of the eight electoral divisions in Carlow, comprising a total population of 4,501, that are currently located in the existing Wicklow constituency, and which have been for the past 20 years.  This will eliminate the breach of the Carlow county boundary and ensure that all of that county is now in the same constituency.<\/p> <p> The commission was also required to report on the constituencies for the election of Members to the European Parliament.  In its report the commission recommended maintaining the existing arrangement of constituencies for the election of Ireland&rsquo;s 11 Members of the European Parliament and, therefore, I will not be bringing forward any amendments to the Third Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 in which the constituencies for European Parliament elections and the number of Members to be elected for each constituency are specified.  Should the number of members to be elected from Ireland change before the next elections to the European Parliament in June 2019, section 5(1A) of the Electoral Act 1997 provides that a committee can be established to make a report in respect of the European Parliament constituencies.  This was done in 2013.<\/p> <p> I will now outline the provisions of the Bill before us.  The legislation generally mirrors previous Bills providing for the revision of D&aacute;il constituencies following a census of population.  Section 1 provides for the definition of Minister and for particular references in the Schedule to the Bill.  It is in the Schedule that the geography of each constituency is described or specified.  Section 2 provides that once the Act is passed, there will be 160 Members in the next D&aacute;il following its passage, that is to say, the D&aacute;il elected after the dissolution of the current D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides for those 160 Members to represent the constituencies specified in the Schedule.  There will be 39 constituencies of which 13 will have five seats, 17 will have four seats and nine will have three seats.  Section 4 provides that each constituency shall return the number of Members specified in relation to it in the Schedule.  Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 6(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for the total number of Members of the D&aacute;il to be no less than 166 and no more than 172 following the next review of D&aacute;il constituencies.  That would be due after census 2021.  The maximum number that the Constituency Commission could recommend is 160 and that is what is provided for in the Bill.  Having regard to projected increases in the population, it is likely that the limit of 160 Members provided for in the Electoral Act 1997 would not provide for the total number of Members to be within the constitutional limits at the next constituency review following census 2021.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides for the 2013 Act to be repealed on the dissolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that next occurs after the passing of this Act.  This effectively means that the existing constituencies continue in force until the next general election.<\/p><p>For example, the constituencies in the 2013 Act will be in force for the referendums and presidential election to be held in 2018 and for any D&aacute;il by-elections held, unless there is a general election in the interim.  Section 7 is a standard provision for the short title and collective citation.<\/p> <p> The Bill continues the long-established practice of implementing the recommendations of independent constituency commissions in full and without amendment, which has been an important factor in supporting the independence of the review process.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to revise the constituencies and I look forward to the debate.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200048#XX00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513104300,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The Bill affects the constituency of Roscommon-Galway, which I am very privileged to represent.

As the Minister of State probably knows, north Roscommon is a very strong base for me.  I feel sorry for the people of Keadue, Ballyfarnon and many other areas in that locality.  I have no doubt that the two Fianna F&aacute;il representatives for Sligo-Leitrim, Deputies MacSharry and Scanlon, will be delighted for that part of north Roscommon to be made part of their constituency and they will work for it.  However, 7,800 voters have been left in no-man's land.  I say that with no disrespect to the excellent representatives for Sligo-Leitrim.  However, here we go again.  That the Sligo-Leitrim constituency comprised Sligo, Leitrim and parts of Donegal and Cavan was absolutely ridiculous.  The commission recognised that having that part of Cavan in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency was neither feasible nor good.  However, it has taken a chunk from Roscommon and put it into Sligo-Leitrim and has given back Cavan.  We have to get away from treating counties in this manner.  It is not acceptable and, in the long term, Members will have to ensure that it is changed.<\/p>  <p>  With no disrespect to the people who will be representing the area, north Roscommon has been gutted from top to bottom by the fish knife of the commission.  It has been left in no man's land.  It needs strong representation, which I have no doubt it will receive, but it is utterly unfair to do that to any community.  Such changes have occurred throughout the country on many occasions.  The population of County Roscommon is 64,000 but that of the Roscommon-Galway constituency is approximately 84,000 or 85,000, which is a little short of what is stipulated in the legislation.  The House must devise a system to ensure that no county is treated in such a manner.  It has been done too many times and I am not happy with what has been done in respect of north Roscommon.<\/p>  <p>  There are great people coming to my constituency from the Galway East constituency, which is good Fianna F&aacute;il country, and I welcome them.

In a similar manner to Deputy Eugene Murphy or any of my colleagues who may speak on the Bill, I believe it lacks imagination.

There is much confusion in terms of who to support or who is one's representative.  Although all Deputies will represent their constituents as best they can, county boundaries are important.  Some 18 constituencies are untouched but Galway East has once again been badly affected.  We supported and propped up Roscommon in 2011 and we are now giving it more of our good people and propping it up further.  I do not understand why Galway East is to lose over 8,500 voters, as is Roscommon-Galway to Sligo-Leitrim, while 4,500 voters are to be transferred to Galway East from Galway West.  That appears to be gerrymandering for the sake of it.  There must be an easier way to redraw constituencies.  I suggested that if the commission did not want to leave the constituencies of Mayo and Galway East as they were, then perhaps four seats should have been allocated to each.  That may not have been the most popular measure but it would have kept the county intact, which is very important.  County councillors also have concerns as to what will happen to council boundaries because they need to know how their bases will be affected and whether there will be a predominance of city voters or otherwise in their areas.

We are bound by Article 16 of the Constitution and the practice, which is a horrible word often used in the House, is that all Members will say that the Bill is great and accept it and on we go.  I ask the Minister of State, who I have known for a long time, to be the pioneering Minister who facilitates a public consultation in the year ahead on how Article 16 could and should be amended to take cognisance of how the population of Ireland is currently constituted.  There is no question that when the Constitution was written in 1937, the population of the country and the migratory patterns that have happened since could not have been envisaged.  On foot of that and the failure to amend Article 16, the practice currently applied by the electoral commission, which does the best job it can in very difficult circumstances, is probably as good as it can be.  However, the practice has become for the commission to look at where the population is, ensure a minimum of one Deputy per 30,000 people and then try to stuff together whatever voters are left over.  It could happen in the Minister of State's constituency.  Piltown and Fiddown could be put in with another part of Waterford or Carrick-on-Suir in south Tipperary.  That is the kind of thing that could happen.  We now have hybrid constituencies such as my own, which is more akin to a constituency for the 1984 European Parliament election than a modern D&aacute;il constituency.  People are being disenfranchised.  That is not to say that any Deputy would not be exceptionally proud to represent all people, regardless of whether they live in Boyle, Sligo, Donegal or anywhere else.<\/p><p>The fact is that Article 16 of the Constitution is not fit for purpose.  We need a constitutional referendum.  I am not saying I have the solution, but we need to find a different way.  In 30 years' time, no matter who is sitting in these seats, we will have 120 Deputies representing the greater Dublin conurbation from Wexford to Dundalk and a sprinkling of 40 or 45 Deputies representing the rest of the country, which is not on, and at some stage some Minister will suggest considering the matter.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State for a public consultation on this.  It would not cost very much.  Let us see what innovative, creative ideas are out there that could take cognisance of the fact that we need representation of all parts of Ireland.  We can then have a constitutional referendum on Article 16 and make the necessary improvements.<\/p> <p> Regarding the naming of constituencies, and I know there are some proposed amendments in this regard, but to add insult to injury, what are the people of south Donegal or south Roscommon to think when their constituency is called Sligo-Leitrim?  The people of west Cavan were rightly indignant that they were moved into that constituency.  It was joked around these Houses that some Deputies and Senators from that part of the country would erect signs stating \"Welcome to Sligo-Leitrim\" in Virginia.  Such decisions are an insult to people.

It was absolutely ludicrous, as my colleague, Deputy Marc MacSharry, said, that parts of west and south Cavan were moved into constituencies with Sligo, Leitrim and south Donegal.  If I had to opt to stay in that constituency, rather than in the reduced Cavan-Monaghan constituency, and if I was going to that part of south Donegal that was put in with Cavan, I would travel into and out of Northern Ireland twice, back into the Republic, to get to Donegal.

I honestly believe that former practising politicians should sit on the commission.  There is no point in saying nowadays that east Cavan or west Cavan is a great Fianna F&aacute;il area, a great Fine Gael area or a great Sinn F&eacute;in area.  That is gone now because we know from the results of recent elections that things have changed dramatically.  A good case could be made for very distinguished former Members of this House from the main parties as well as Independents serving on the commission.  If there had been a former practising politician on the commission in 2012, he or she would never have signed off on the configuration of south Donegal, all of Sligo-Leitrim and west and south Cavan.  My colleagues, Deputies Eugene Murphy, Anne Rabbitte and Marc MacSharry made the point in the part of the debate that I have heard that it is a total injustice to so many communities.  I am very happy that all of Cavan is back with all of County Monaghan.  We have seven electoral divisions coming in from the Meath East constituency, and the people living in those electoral divisions are quite rightly very unhappy.  We fully understand that and while the commission had to consider things in general, it did not need to move the people in east Meath into Cavan.  I think there was a wrong reading of the tolerance level.<\/p><p>I made a detailed submission to the commission at the time.  This time last year, I was preparing it and, unfortunately, one of my best friends in politics, Brendan Reilly from Ballyjamesduff, who did much of the drafting of my submission, specifically the work on the figures and so on, was killed two weeks ago in a car accident.  He was a great and very close friend of mine, and I wish to record the contribution he made to the submission that I submitted to the commission at the time.<\/p><p>Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution sets out that &quot;the total number of members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.&quot;  Of Article 16.2.2&deg;, the submission states:<\/p><blockquote>This gives the Commission some scope to give adequate and due tolerance to recognise the particular pressures on rural constituencies vis-&agrave;-vis representation and adherence to the population per D&aacute;il Member.  The present Cavan\/Monaghan constituency [as it is at present] is a totally rural region, yet it is 3.18% above the average ratio.  [The constituencies that were meant to be above the average ratio were the urban constituencies, not the very rural constituencies.]  This is leaving an area with very specific social and economic problems both underrepresented and badly divided.<br \/><br \/>The 5% deviation from the national average is only implied and is by no means set in stone.<br \/><br \/>Greater latitude in deviating from the national average, as established by previous Commissions prior to the 2012 Commission, would give the necessary flexibility to reverse the extreme impact of the 2012 revision where [unexpectedly] four counties ended up in the one constituency[, the first time ever in the history of the State this has happened].  From the Commission's own Statement on Relevant Provisions - while the reference to Justice Clarke's judgement leans towards a deviation from the national average lower than 5%, - it is important to note that the Supreme Court clearly studiously avoids setting any such limit and ruled as quoted in the Commission's statement:The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have.  Its decision could not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article.  This Court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above or below which a variation from what is called the national average is not permitted.<\/blockquote><p>Commissions in the past allowed a deviation of approximately 5%.  It is provided for in the Constitution.  I urge the Minister of State to change this, as my colleague, Deputy Marc MacSharry said, in order that we do not disenfranchise large parts of rural communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200051#AAA00400","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1513104900,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Deputy Thomas Byrne has three and a half minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200051#AAA00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1513104900,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I will use two minutes of the slot and give the rest to Deputy Scanlon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200051#AAA00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1513104900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200051#AAA00700","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1513104900,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I will not argue about what the commission has done in this case.

That is not to take away from the legitimacy of the points raised by colleagues.  We absolutely have a right to debate the legislation underpinning the establishment of electoral commissions and we certainly should scrutinise their reports to determine whether they adhere to the terms of reference.  However, we must be careful about getting into discussions as to whether we agree with and accept the commission's recommendations, because those recommendations may have a direct bearing on how easy or difficult it is for us to get elected on the next occasion.<\/p><p>There is a very difficult balance for any commission to achieve in terms of getting the ratios right, respecting existing county, local authority and community boundaries and getting the urban-rural balance correct.  I do not envy the commission members in tackling any of those matters.  If the issues Deputies have raised had not been addressed in they way they were, there would be another group of Deputies complaining about the alternative solution.  This is not easy work and I acknowledge the efforts of the commission in preparing the report.<\/p><p>While my own constituency is not affected on this occasion, a previous local government boundary review brought about some changes on its periphery.  While they had no negative impact on my election bid, having spoken to people living in rural Brittas and Saggart, on the divide between the local electoral area, LEA, and the general election boundary, many felt that their local councillors were not necessarily serving them because they were in a neighbouring general election constituency and their Deputies were not necessarily serving them because they are in a neighbouring LEA.  These are genuine concerns and I am not arguing that we should be discounted from raising them.<\/p><p>While it is not pertinent to the legislation before us, I would be open to a consultation on or review of the constitutional limit.  However, any such exercise would have to be based on the need to achieve a better balance between the different components of the process, not making it easier for sitting politicians to secure their re-election.  I do not in any way suggest that Members who referred to the constitutional limit did so for anything other than genuine purposes.  However, for the public to have faith in such a process, we must make that very clear.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is joining other groups in supporting the Bill.  It would be wrong for the Oireachtas to set about amending the commission's recommendations.  As I said, if Members wish to change the process for determining boundaries, whether in respect of the constitutional limit or the way the terms of reference are set for the commission membership, that is a legitimate matter for us to debate.  Today, however, we have a set of recommendations from an independent commission and the right thing to do, notwithstanding the individual difficulties for some of us arising out of those recommendations, is to support them.<\/p><p>Constituencies with a larger number of seats are more representative because they afford a greater representation of the political views of constituents.  While larger parties often prefer constituencies to have a smaller number of seats and Independents and smaller parties usually prefer a larger number, the more important consideration is that having a larger number usually gives a better reflection of the diversity of opinion within the constituency.  In future, therefore, we should look to having more constituencies with a larger number of seats, purely for the representational and proportionate balance they offer.<\/p><p>There is strong merit in having a standing independent electoral office similar to that which operates in the North so that we do not have to establish <i>ad hoc<\/i>commissions after every census.  There are obvious benefits in having a proper, professional body whose job is not only to maintain a rolling review of constituencies, boundaries and seat numbers but also to deal with issues of electoral registration, centralisation and scrutiny of the register and so on.  A body like that would develop experience over time and might include former politicians or former Oireachtas staff among its membership.  I urge the Government to look at this issue in a more rounded way in the future.<\/p><p>To reiterate, I respect the views expressed by Members this evening.  However, having set up an independent commission, agreed its terms of reference and let it do its job, we should not necessarily engage in criticism of its decisions, although some of them are difficult for voters and communities in our constituencies or for individual Deputies.  We should acknowledge the commission's achievement in doing the job we tasked it do and we should support the report it has produced.  For the future, rather than waiting for the next report, we should set about, possibly on an appropriate cross-party basis, finding a way of ensuring the process for setting electoral boundaries is improved in order that we no longer encounter the difficulties colleagues have articulated today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200052#BBB00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1513105500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The constituency I represent will be changed again as a consequence of the commission's report.

Section 6(2)(<i>f<\/i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 states &quot;Subject to the provisions of this section, the Commission shall endeavour to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangements of constituencies&quot;.  In the case of Laois, Offaly and Kildare South, however, that is not the case.  Laois-Offaly was the same constituency from 1923 to 2016, with Laurence Brady being the last Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy to be elected before I took my seat in February 2011.  I thank the people of Laois-Offaly for electing me to what was then a five-seat constituency.  In 2012, we received a report like the one we are discussing today indicating that the boundaries would be changed to create a three-seat constituency of Laois, which, in order to have an adequate population, would include a chunk of Kildare South, comprising Monasterevin, Kilberry and Kildangan.  The view at the time was that I was unlikely to be returned at the next election, but the good people of Monasterevin, Kilberry and Kildangan gave me a good vote, having worked hard for them in the previous two years.  I will continue to represent them until the end of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  In fact, I have a small office in Monasterevin and although the people there will not be able to vote for me again, I have a duty to continue to represent them.<\/p><p>It is fair enough that Monasterevin, Kilberry and Kildangan are to be returned to Kildare South.<\/p><p>There is, however, also a large chunk coming out of Laois and a small bite coming out of Offaly.  Some 9,450 people from Laois and 2,404 people from Offaly will go in to make up the new Kildare South constituency, which will be a four seater.  That was a three seater.  There will be pieces of three counties going to make up one constituency in the bottom half of Kildare.<\/p> <p> I understand that sometimes a county boundary has to be broken.  We argued this with the Minister of State's predecessor, the former Minister, Phil Hogan.  In fact, if I remember correctly, we had arguments about a good few things.  Sometimes we agreed on some issues, especially on the boundary of Graiguecullen, an issue that went on for years.  Deputy Pat Deering will be familiar with it.  Phil Hogan was the one man who did make the change, which I had raised with him in the D&aacute;il, to align the county council boundary in Graiguecullen with the general election boundary, with the GAA boundary and with the county boundary.  It is one of the good things the then Minister achieved in that D&aacute;il and I give him credit for it.  It was the sensible thing to do.<\/p> <p> Moving on to where we are now, as things stand and without the changes, the report states: \"While Laois and Kildare constituencies have acceptable variations, it is necessary to alter these to address the high variances in the Offaly constituency.\"  In the last census, Offaly had a population of 77,961 and County Laois had a population of 84,697, and it is growing by the day.  Laois is a fast growing county.  The national average of population per Deputy is 29,762.  There were better options and there is a problem because not only is the proposal breaking into two counties, but it is also breaching a small area, Gracefield, with a small chunk coming out of east Offaly and into Kildare South.  A very large chunk is also being taken out of Laois, with all of Portarlington, Killenard, Ballybrittas and Jamestown going in with Kildare.<\/p> <p> Turning to what could have happened, a small piece could have been taken out of Tipperary.  According to the report, the Laois and Kildare numbers were fine but the problem was with Offaly, which needed some more population.  That part of North Tipperary with which people were connected since the last boundary change could have been left with Offaly.  A piece of Westmeath or County Meath could also have come into the north of Offaly, as could the piece of east Kildare where the boundary was already moved.  Any of those options could have given Offaly sufficient population to retain three seats and would have meant breaching only one county boundary, not two.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin said, I understand that the commission does not have an easy job.  Every action it takes has a knock-on consequence.  We know that most actions have knock-on consequences as when we move one piece of a jigsaw.  I can see that, but I have looked at it and there were a number of other options.  I am trying to be impartial here, but, being a Deputy, it is hard.  One can imagine what it is like to be elected to Laois-Offaly, when one feels one is doing grand, getting to know the people of Offaly and doing the clinics.  The next thing one discovers they are gone and one has to keep representing them.  I kept representing those people right up to the finish of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il in February 2016.  Having had a greater base in Kildare South, I now find myself losing the Kildare South constituency, although I will continue to represent the people there.  I now have to go back to Laois-Offaly again.<\/p> <p> The consequence of this boundary change is three different constituencies in five years and two county boundaries having changed.  I have another consequence for the Minster of State - Kildare has an absolute guarantee of eight Deputies after the next election.  It will be four and four, but what is Laois guaranteed?  Kildare has a population of some 220,000 but Laois will have a population of almost 90,000 by the next election.  Laois is growing faster than Kildare for a number of reasons, which I will not go into here, according to the last two censuses.  Laois could possibly wind up with only two Deputies after the next election, with a population of 90,000, whereas neighbouring Kildare, with a population of 220,000, will wind up with an absolute guarantee of eight Deputies.

She will have to deal with three different administrative staff and three different electoral areas.  God help her because that is going to be hard to do.  The boundary change is taking pieces of three counties to make one constituency.<\/p>  <p>  My last point concerns voter turnout.  In the last election, voter turnout in Laois was just over 39,000 of a 62,000 population.  That was a 60% to 61% turnout.  It was slightly higher, at 62%, in Offaly.  That is small and it is not good for democracy in any man's book, or any woman's book either.  We need to try to increase the turnout in elections.  The public in Portarlington, Killenard and Ballybrittas in north Laois are now told they are Lillywhites and that somehow they belong to Kildare, and they are not too happy about it.  Many of them are very annoyed and say that they will not vote because they are being tied in with Kildare against their will.  Obviously, I would encourage people to vote, even if they cannot vote for me, as they should always use their votes.<\/p>  <p>  Their county councils, however, will continue to be Laois in the case of that part of north Laois, and the Gracefield end of Portarlington will continue to under Offaly County Council.  The natural hinterland of Portlaoise is Portarlington, Killenard, Ballybrittas and Jamestown, which is eight or nine miles away.  The natural hinterland is not Naas, which is within a few minutes of Dublin.  Laois in particular has been chopped away as if with a blunt axe.  The commission should have paid more attention to breaching county boundaries.  I understand that one might need to be breached, but the problem is that two county boundaries have been breached.  Whoever represents the people within those areas is going to have to deal with three county councils.<\/p>  <p>  There were other options, which I believe were better options.  I do not want to complain too much about it but a better fit could have been achieved, especially for the people of north Laois.  Laois could have been left intact.  It could have enough population by the day of the next election for three seats, if we were able to sit tight for the rest of this year.  If we get through most of 2018, the population of Laois will be more than adequate.  Currently, it is constitutionally more than adequate to provide for three Deputies.  There was no need for a boundary change on a constitutional basis and it is a pity.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the other changes have been good.  As I said earlier, we need to set up a standing electoral commission or an electoral office so there is an ongoing independent body in place that can develop the expertise and take submissions from people.  That is my view of it.  I am not saying this for my own sake - I also said this in the last D&aacute;il, when there was no breach of two county boundaries that affected me.  It is, however, a bad day's work when three parts of three counties are needed to make up an electoral district.  It is a bad day's work that Laois may only have two Deputies but County Kildare is guaranteed eight.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the people of Laois-Offaly who, in 2011, elected me to represent them.

We have to build up the rest of the country and that includes ensuring that other cities and large centres of population grow in size.  The current draft national planning framework does not go far enough to achieve that.  I have put in a submission on my own city of Limerick, as well as a submission on behalf of the Labour Party at a national level, urging that we get real action to ensure we get such population balance.  There are many consequences of failing to do so, one being that we would have a huge number of Deputies around the Dublin area and much fewer in the rest of the country.  I do not want to see that appalling vista.  The national framework strategy has a significant role to play in ensuring that the country is properly represented and it is very much linked to what we are debating this evening.<br\/><br\/>On the constitutional requirements, I wish to briefly defend my colleague, Joe Costello.  When there was a threat of an election - it seems like a while ago but it is only recently - he went to the High Court on the basis of his belief that if the election went ahead before Christmas, prior to this legislation being passed, it would have breached the constitutional requirements.  Based on the two sections which I read out, I believe he was correct, although I would not second guess the courts.  Mr. Costello's senior counsel noted:<\/p><blockquote>arising from the 2016 census and the 2017 Constituency Commission report, the next D&aacute;il must have more members than the current D&aacute;il to stay within the rules as set by Article 16.2.2\u02da...  The next D&aacute;il must have at least 159 members to comply with article 16.2.2\u02da and the commission has recommended that the next D&aacute;il have 160 ...  If an election is held it would return 158 TDs which would breach article 16.2.2\u02da which creates a mandatory obligation not to breach the limits ...  An election would mean three TDs being returned for Mr. Costello's Dublin Central Constituency, when that should be four.  The kind of issue which was raised in the case has never previously arisen ...  Unless the legislation was introduced urgently the next D&aacute;il could have its constitution and authority questioned ...  The situation required to be immediately addressed but while there was a Bill in draft stage to act on the commission's recommendations, that had not been put before Cabinet. <\/blockquote><p>Thankfully we will deal with this Bill this week and I presume that the Seanad will also be able to deal with it before Christmas -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200053#CCC00400","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513106700,"counter":450,"content":"<p>On Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200054#DDD00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1513106700,"counter":451,"content":"<p>----- and hopefully we will not have an election too early in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  Even in the McGrath and Murphy case of 2007 which the Minister of State quoted, there was a reference to an urgent burden on the Oireachtas following the census.  It is quite a significant argument but one which happily has now passed us by.<\/p>  <p>  I have tabled an amendment and Deputies Cowen and Breathnach have tabled amendments that are very similar to mine.  In none of those amendments do we question the commission's decisions regarding boundaries and representation but we are questioning the names of the constituencies.  Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to how the Louth constituency takes in a significant portion of east Meath but does not name it.  There are smaller parts of other constituencies that have also been brought in and not named, but in that area there was concern among the people in the coastal area of Meath that they were not part of the constituency name.  We are not questioning the substance of what the commission is recommending but I would like to know who decides the names. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200054#DDD00300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1513106700,"counter":452,"content":"<p>It is the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200054#DDD00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1513106700,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Names were changed in the Dublin area and there was the case I just mentioned in Louth.  I presume it is the commission itself but on what basis?  Is it arbitrary?  Why does it decide to change names or have particular names for particular constituencies?  It is something on which public representatives possibly should have some role because we know our constituencies and people do get upset when their constituency name changes.<\/p>  <p>  My next remarks are somewhat similar to those raised by others.  My constituency is losing a part of Clare which we had, gaining a piece of Tipperary and we are giving back to County Limerick part of east Limerick which we have had and it had before us.  It is a case of \"I stepped out and I stepped in again\".  I particularly feel for people in those types of constituencies who might have moved three or four times in the last 20 years, or a relatively short time.  The Cappamore area and its neighbouring parishes in county Limerick is the area particularly affected in my constituency.  I have represented them in the past, then not represented them, then represented them and then not represented them, and I have not been in this House for an especially long time.  It is particularly difficult for people in those areas whose constituency keeps moving because they are they easiest to move when numbers change.<\/p>  <p>  I also support the idea of there being fewer three-seat constituencies.  It is better to have a broader type of representation in order that most people can see somebody in the Oireachtas who represents their point of view.  It is right that we have larger constituencies with more individuals representing them.  <\/p>  <p>  Like others, I was very pleased to represent a piece of County Clare.  Part of it is in the parish where I live; it is literally the other side of the bridge over the River Shannon from my home, and I will continue to represent those people until there is an election.  I know many of them very well.  I will continue to hold my constituency clinic in the area.  There are areas such as Shannon Banks, Westbury, Parteen and part of Ardnacrusha, which are very close to Limerick city.  I appreciate that Clare has got itself back together as a county and I can understand why this is happening.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley just referred to the northern part of Tipperary coming back into Tipperary but the piece nearest to us is coming into Limerick which would be the Newport-Birdhill area.  I would be very happy to represent the people in that area and give a continuity of service that had previously been given by Labour Deputies, the most recent one being Deputy Kelly.  There is some dissatisfaction that people who have always been represented in a Tipperary constituency are now coming into the Limerick city constituency but we will do our best to represent them.  <\/p>  <p>  Ideally we would like to see county boundaries unbreached but we are bound by the Constitution, as is the commission.  We have to accept that it has to do its best in drawing boundaries.  I am more concerned for the people in those areas than their public representatives.  We will get on with doing our job as best we can, but there is confusion for people living in areas who find themselves moved from one constituency to another.  To return to the national planning framework, what we would like to see is that there would be an effort to stabilise populations and not have migration from the more rural, western parts of the country to the east coast.  During discussions on the national planning framework, it emerged that Maynooth is the centre of Ireland by population, because there are roughly as many people living east of Maynooth as there are to its west, although in geographical terms it is nowhere near the centre of Ireland.  It is an indication that we need to see national planning work towards a more balanced country which would be better for everyone.  We will not oppose this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200054#DDD00500","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1513106700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) (D&aacute;il Constituencies) Bill 2017.<\/p><p>This Bill will provide for the implementation of the Constituency Commission Report 2017, the recommendations of which include increasing the number of Deputies from 158 to 160 and reducing the number of constituencies to 39.  I am in sympathy with previous speakers who referred to parts of constituencies moving back and forth.  In most of my time in this House, my constituency has moved north and south, through it cannot move east because of the sea.  Since the 1980s, we have not had an election in which the constituency remained the same.  I am also sympathetic to the people in the areas affected.  In my case, the Raheny and Edenmore parishes have gone back and forth between constituencies, though they had an advantage in that there would have been up to eight Deputies in the historic Dublin North-East and Dublin North-West constituencies, which were joined together to form Dublin Bay North.  The Deputies in question would have represented parts of the two parishes to which I refer.  At the prospect of a pre-Christmas general election, my former colleague, Joe Costello, took a case to the High Court claiming that such an election would be unconstitutional given that constituency changes had not taken place.  Happily, that election did not materialise and we are dealing with the changes tonight.<\/p> <p> The decision by the Kenny-Gilmore Government to reduce the number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il from 166 to 158 was a typically ill-considered and short-term action from those two politicians and a bad mistake for Irish democracy.  In the cut and thrust of constituency and D&aacute;il electoral politics, the 158 serving Deputies are generally good value for their constituents.  I have always believed in a larger D&aacute;il- with, perhaps, 180 Members - rather than a smaller one.  There could be 20 five-seaters and 20 four-seaters and there could even be bigger constituencies.  There is an issue with bigger constituencies, however, with which all of us, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle included, have lived for some time.  In Dublin Bay North, there are 152,000 people and 58,000 households, which we have to visit each quarter with our reports to constituents.  It is a huge task because, unlike constituencies outside Dublin, anyone in our constituency can ask us to move a representation on his or her behalf.  This means that we represent constituencies that are perhaps twice or even three times the size of a Westminster constituency, which is strange in light of the population of England.<\/p> <p> While every Seanad usually has a few good representatives and performers, from my early months in this House - when I visited with schoolchildren and young people from Dublin north east - I have always believed that the Upper House should be abolished, with the savings going to strong local government led by directly-elected executive mayors, especially in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  The Kenny-Gilmore Government decided on a policy of abolishing the Seanad but refused to mount any significant campaign to achieve that objective.  Senator Michael McDowell and others talk of reforming the Seanad by giving it a popular mandate but Ireland does not need two D&aacute;ileanna, especially in light of the work of the Constitutional Convention and the growing part played by referenda.  The people should constitute our second House and we should come back to the agenda of an enhanced D&aacute;il, as a single House, as is the case in New Zealand, Denmark and other countries that have changed from bicameral to unicameral systems.<\/p> <p> The Minister is bringing a position paper to Cabinet relating to directly-elected executive mayors.  I would warmly welcome this because it has been a constant theme among people with whom I entered politics, especially in the case of the greater Dublin region but also in respect of the greater Cork region in light of the changes being made to Cork in order to make it a leading European-sized second city.  I hope the Minister's plans will take shape in time for the 2019 elections and that there will be new executives by that time.  I have felt for some years that the housing situation is just not being dealt with in the context of the four Dublin counties and we need an overall executive to be able to address such issues.  We have seen the success of these positions and of executives and cabinets in London, Liverpool and Manchester, our great neighbouring cities across the sea, each of which now has a person who can speak for it.<\/p> <p> I made a submission to the Constituency Commission in January as part of its consultation process in the wake of the results of census 2016.  I agreed with the increase of two in the overall number of Deputies and called for them to be given to the Dublin and Leinster region, particularly as the population of the latter is heading for 3 million.  The region should be properly represented in this House.  I also indicated that my first preference would be to return to the previous constituency boundaries relating to Dublin North-East, with Portmarnock, Balgriffin and Kinsealy once again included, and the restoration of the three-seat model.  I also proposed that Dublin North Central should be reconstituted as a three-seat constituency, with any necessary additional territory and population returning from the Santry and lower Fairview-North Strand areas.  It would be right to have six Deputies for that huge population covering 35 or 40 parishes.  My second preference was to leave Dublin Bay North alone and not to lose any territory or population, because the communities and parishes of the constituency have very close social, economic and cultural affinity and civic and political groups and organisations are just beginning to get used to the merged constituency.  There is work for six or even seven Deputies there and one could say the same for Laois-Offaly and other constituencies.  Increased representation should have been the way forward, rather than what happened under the previous Government.<\/p> <p> The Schedule to the Bill sets out the list of constituencies.  Dublin Bay North, which I am proud to represent, is remaining as a five-seat constituency, with some boundary changes.  If the Bill is approved, it will mean that the electoral division of Drumcondra south, comprising 5,000 people, will be transferred out of my constituency and into Dublin Central.  Having represented a constituency which has changed after every electoral commission, I will continue my usual practice of representing the area that elected me right up to the next general election, which includes Drumcondra south in this case.<\/p> <p> Dublin Bay North has a population of 152,943, meaning there are 30,589 citizens per Deputy, which is the basis of the rationale in the report for the reduction of 5,000.  North and west Dublin are under-represented and, given the major changes planned in construction and development over the coming years, I have consistently raised the importance of collaborative development on the north fringe of Dublin city and the adjoining south fringe of Fingal county and stressed the need for close co-operation between both local authorities in these areas.  A colleague spoke earlier of representing three county councils or three major local authorities and I appreciate the enormous amount of work that goes into that.  The north fringe spans a territory from Clonshaugh and Belcamp across to Burnell, Belmayne and Clongriffin and on to Baldoyle and south Portmarnock on the coast.  The population is growing and, at long last, construction has begun.  As I said to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government a few weeks ago, however, we are laying foundation stones rather than delivering homes for our young population.<\/p> <p> Were it not for the crash, we would have had by now a thriving new district in an area that has been lacking in basic infrastructure and resources for the many families who live there.  In my submission to the commission, I noted that the division of the region locally between Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council has created problems, month after month and year after year, for the coherent and sustainable development of the new city region.<\/p><p>I highlighted the importance of local Oireachtas representation invigilating those matters and that the best method to do so would be in one constituency to ensure better accountability for the development of the region.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cowen has submitted an amendment asking that Dublin Bay North and Dublin Bay South go back to being called Dublin North East and Dublin South East.  Dublin North-East had been a constituency since the mid-1930s, when it covered roughly the same territory as it does now.  When it became more populated it became two constituencies, Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central.  It is an interesting proposal, but the population and civic society have got used to the acronym DBN for Dublin Bay North.  The general feeling is that maybe we should leave the name of the constituency alone because it expresses the huge affinity we have with the ocean and the bay, with special amenity areas on Bull Island and in Howth and throughout the constituency.  I am easy on it, but my preference is to leave Dublin Bay North with its name, which the commission in the 2011 Parliament came up with.<\/p> <p> In general terms I welcome the fact the D&aacute;il is expanding.  I would have expanded it much more, with the concomitant impact of having it as a single powerful unicameral Chamber but making sure people on the ground were really well represented with sufficient Deputies.  As it is, I will support the commission's report, even with the loss of south Drumcondra.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200054#DDD00600","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513107900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.

I am delighted to speak on this important legislation.  Constituencies in Ireland have undergone significant changes over the past five years with mergers, divisions and reductions in the number of Deputies.  My constituency of Cork South-West has been amended in a number of ways.  Before I continue, I must point out that I am honoured to have been elected and to work on behalf of my constituents in the D&aacute;il.  However, there are only three Deputies for what is probably the longest constituency in Ireland.  It should have at least five Deputies representing it.<\/p>  <p>  A few years ago my constituency lost many townlands that were, and always will be, considered part of Cork South-West.  A section of Dunmanway has been moved into the Cork North-West constituency, which is absolutely disgraceful.  It leaves the people of the area in no man's land.  I would have tied myself to the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann if I had been a Member of the House at the time to prevent losing that part of Dunmanway.  It should never have happened.  The same applies to Ballineen and Enniskeane.  The two neighbouring small towns are so close they could be considered one.  One town has been exiled to the northern half of west Cork.  With no disrespect to my colleagues from that constituency, this is a mindless change and the people who have been moved are wholly unhappy about it.<\/p>  <p>  The people who made that decision can only be described as pencil pushers.  They drew random lines on maps wherever they wished.  How could anybody think that splitting a town between constituencies would be productive or sensible?  It appears from the way the lines were drawn that it must have been done late at night after a big Christmas party.  The new recommendations from the Constituency Commission have done nothing to solve the problems in my constituency.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the commission to examine this as soon as possible.

Local public representatives do not know where to go.  In addition, recently I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group raised in the D&aacute;il the issue of the Mackinnon report and the local government changes proposed for Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  Again, these are senseless changes that are nothing less than power grabs by the city council.  There is no democracy in them.  The locals on both sides of the city and county border are not happy with these changes.  The people in offices who are making these detrimental decisions have no concept of what they are doing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I neither support nor agree with the agreement reached between the councils last Monday week.  Many people in areas such as Ballincollig, who are now being forced into the city, are not happy either.  It is another example of democracy being thrown out the window.  Councillors work tirelessly, day and night, for their communities.  Councillors such as Kevin Conway, Marcia D'Alton, June Murphy, Danny Collins and many more are totally opposed to the destructive extension of the city boundary in Cork.  It appears that the only supporters of this merger are those who back the establishment.  If it goes ahead, the decision will have devastating consequences for County Cork.  However, I hope common sense will prevail and that those who back the establishment will change and listen to the people who elected them.  I am delighted to hear that the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors are now speaking strongly against this, even though a couple of weeks ago when I and the Rural Independent Group brought forward a motion on the issue in the House the silence from that party was deafening.  Its Members rejected the motion, which could have led to kicking out the Mackinnon report.<\/p>  <p>  People in offices who decide on such detrimental changes have no understanding of the areas they are changing.  With regard to the new recommendations, I have noted that in many constituencies voters who had been moved from their traditional constituencies for the last election have been moved back in, but in other cases voters have been moved out.  This is like robbing Peter to pay Paul.  It does not make sense.  A number of voters around the country still feel disengaged from local politics and their public representatives.  I plead with the Minister of State to listen to the concerns I have raised.  If this continues to happen democracy will be thrown out the window.<\/p>  <p>  I see no provision in the Bill that seeks to amend the blatant errors of taking areas such as north Dunmanway, Enniskeane, Murragh and parts of Newcestown out of Cork South-West.  I agree with the Constituency Commission on leaving areas such as Castletownbere, Cahermore, Eyeries, Allihies, Bere Island, Ardgroom, Dursey Island, Adrigole and Glengarriff in the constituency, as they should stay in Cork.  Serious consideration should be given to shifting Lauragh to the constituency of Cork South-West, as it surrounds the area and the townlands.  If that happened, I would seriously consider supporting the Bill.  However, it is another piece of undemocratic work introduced by pencil pushers in offices who do not know the lie of the land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200057#GGG01100","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1513108500,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I call the leader of your group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200057#GGG01200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1513108500,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I think I will be resigning because I do not know who will keep the peace in the group with all the land grabs that are taking place in Kerry, Cork and elsewhere.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam c&aacute; bhfuil all but I am looking forward to tomorrow, am&aacute;rach.  I am happy to speak on this issue.  Is pribhl&eacute;id m&oacute;r dom &eacute;, a huge privilege, to be elected to serve the people of all of Tipperary, aside for the bit that has been hived off into Limerick.  I was also honoured and privileged to represent west Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with having county boundaries as far as possible but one must also consider a town such as Clonmel.  The river divides the town.  A sizeable portion of the town that is across the river is in County Waterford.  The people there were born in the hospital in Clonmel, they went to school in Clonmel and they work and socialise in Clonmel.  They want to vote in Tipperary.  I mean no disrespect to Deputy Butler who represents Waterford, but those people are Clonmel people.  Such a town should not be divided.  My colleagues were speaking about the country.<\/p>  <p>  We kept Cromwell out of Clonmel centuries ago but we could not keep out big Phil, the destroyer and enforcer.  He banished our town councils.  He got rid of 11 borough councils and all the town councils throughout the country.  Other Deputies have referred to how he trod on them.  I met the Minister of State's supporters earlier and they were not very interested in his move to Europe either.  The Minister of State must have hand-picked the crowd he brought here because they were all big supporters of the Minister of State.  They have forgotten about the man who has left these shores, although as Kilkenny has no seashore he left the pastures of Kilkenny.<\/p>  <p>  When we were engaged in talks on a programme for Government we spoke about holding plebiscites in the borough districts to ask the people if they wanted the town councils restored.  We can discuss the money afterwards.  There would be no cost to the State or the taxpayer.  All of the county councillors I knew, be they from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party or independents, worked tirelessly for the people, not for reward.  They were doing that before there ever was remuneration.  The council itself was not a cost.<\/p><p>The huge cost was due to the county managers, all the staff and the directors of services.  What they are getting would pay all the councils and the town council for one year.  I am making this point very honestly.  They gave dedicated service, looked after their people and supported the Garda and the Neighbourhood Watch.  In respect of the 11 councillors in the town of Clonmel, they picked up the phone and rang them to get the lowdown on what was going on the area.  It was necessary.  They were on the ground and in touch and the Government must try to reinstate that.  When the Bill was finally passed, I told the former Minister, Phil Hogan, when I was the last Member to speak that I would meet him in another forum.  With my support, former councillor Niall Dennehy from Former Local Authority Members &Eacute;ire, FLAME, has taken a case to the High Court.  We are awaiting answers from the Department to progress that case.  The Minister of State might look into why we cannot get relevant answers to our parliamentary questions in order that we can progress that case in the Four Courts.  <\/p> <p> I note Deputy Cassells has produced a Bill that will go before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government tomorrow in a meeting I hope to attend.  In fairness, his Private Members' Bill will restore this but we should start by reinstating the borough councils and then look at town councils in a voluntary capacity if necessary because the volunteers are there.  It is good political ground for spawning and training young politicians.  If we were honest, many of us here would admit that we started there - t&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre - so what are we are ashamed of now?  Is it a case of pulling up the ladder and to hell with the people behind them?  No, we want our town council back in Clonmel.  We used to have a budget of &euro;15.1 million in that town.  We now have nothing.  We also had the town of Carrick-on-Suir, although we never had it in Cahir but we had a block grant.  We had the towns of Cashel, Tipperary town and indeed right up into Thurles, Templemore, Nenagh and Roscrea.  If we had to, we would go as far as Birr - if they were not able to look after it - because Deputy Cowen did not come in to do much for Tipperary when they were looking after it.  We must leave county boundaries alone where possible except when the make-up of a sizeable town, its seed, breed and generation, means it is in a single enclave and so it must be left alone.  We need to go back to the drawing board here.  Deputy Michael Collins was pulled up by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for criticising the mandarins who drew the lines.  They must be held accountable.  Retired politicians and retired senior civil servants should be on this commission, along with lay people so that it is not the preserve of the great institution down in the town where all the retired civil servants and county managers are.  They have to be rooted out.  We should turn off the heating there to see whether they will get out and let us, the elected people, govern.  We should bring in lay people and retired politicians who have a wealth of knowledge - no more than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We need common sense to prevail.  We do not need attacks and forays like those affecting south-west Cavan, Sligo-Leitrim and indeed south Donegal.  The men who drew that up were crazy.  They must be asleep or been out the night before.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200057#GGG01300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513109100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Brassil and O'Loughlin.  I will take about ten minutes.  I thank the boundary commission for completing a very difficult task.  I think we will find that after each revision of the boundaries, there will be a very similar kind of debate here with some people happy and others unhappy.  Essentially, there can be serious confusion for constituents, particularly on the fringes of electoral boundaries, who often find themselves in and out of constituencies.  Accepting that, we must remember what the Constitution says.  It talks about the tolerances between 20,000 and 30,000 - no less than 20,000 and no more 30,000.  However, it also says that as far is practicable, it should be equal throughout the country and that it should be reviewed at least once every 12 years.  That was put into the Constitution at a time when there was a census of population every ten years.  After 1971, the census was reviewed every five years.  This change brought into sharp focus the fact that the Constitution said it should be done at least every 12 years.  We knew then that there were facts and figures showing that constituencies were out of sync with the results of the census.  I saw it as well.  I raised the matter continually in the D&aacute;il throughout 2006.  I did not get anywhere with it and Deputy Finian McGrath and I took a case to the High Court that was referred to on a number of occasions this evening.<\/p>  <p>  On that occasion, ten constituencies were seriously out of line.  When we look at how tight it can be with regard to who forms a Government, that matters.  We can all look at our individual constituencies.  It matters who forms a Government.  If there is a difference of maybe two or three people on one side or the other side of the House and the boundaries have not been reviewed, one could rightly claim that it has been an undemocratic process.  This is the point we must keep in mind.  It is not just from rural to urban.  During the review at that time, and we had a look at the numbers in some considerable detail, D&uacute;n Laoghaire had one seat too many and Dublin West had one seat too few.  The irony was that one person was part of the next Government and the other person lost their seat.  One should have been elected while there should not have been the extra seat in the other constituency, so it can matter.  If we are really talking about democracy in the big sense of the word in terms of representing the country as it stands, we must not lose sight of that.  <\/p>  <p>  The judge in this case, who is now Chief Justice, reminded us that it was not just a Government obligation but the obligation of the Oireachtas to carry out this revision, although, in practice, we know the work is done by the particular Department, which is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  He also said it should immediately set in train the review of the constituencies and that it was a matter of the utmost importance.  We saw just recently that we could have been in the middle of a general election with a revision that should have taken place so we can see the urgency regarding making sure that we are true to the Constitution and that as far as is practicable, we make sure that every citizen in this country is equal.  I wanted to make that point because I have listened to many things here that tend to look at it in a fragmented way, which is very frustrating because it is about a bigger principle.  I can also feel great sympathy for people on the fringes of constituencies who are in and out and feel very frustrated about that and where one sees a town divided where it should not be divided.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been hugely frustrated by what we do not do with our census of population.  I have seen numerous examples.  The advertisement goes out and people are told to fill in the census form on census night, as they should and as I would always encourage them to do, because we need this information so that we can provide services.  One then looks at how the census is or is not used.  For example, how come Kildare has the lowest ratio of garda&iacute; to population?  Meath is pretty similar, as is the likes of Wexford.  These are places that have grown very substantially and where there is a policing plan every year that is supposed to look at demographics and crime statistics.  However, in fact, up to now, it has been a work of fiction.  We look at some of the services that are provided by the HSE.  They bear no relationship to that growing population and those needs.  I have a huge criticism of the underuse of the census of population in terms of the delivery of service.  It fails spectacularly in terms of what it asks people to put in the census form and what it does with the information afterwards.  I had a look at the data relating to growth in the country over 20 years.  If we start looking at the area around Dublin, we can see that the city centre grew by 13% while Cork city only grew by 1% so the figures are not growing in the right places.  I looked at the fringes.  Fingal grew by 43% while Meath grew by 44% and Kildare grew by 39%.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200058#HHH00200","speaker":"1226"}]
