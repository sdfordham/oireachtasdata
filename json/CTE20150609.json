This proposal is to allow each member state decide if they wish to permit or ban the import and use of GM food and feed in their territory.  The proposal states that such prohibitions or restrictions must be reasoned and based on compelling grounds and must not conflict with the EFSA risk assessment.<\/p> <p>  Genetic modification is a science-based technology which, in the case of plants, alters the gene structure in a way that does not occur naturally through fertilisation or natural recombination.  This modification confers certain traits on the plant that can be advantageous to agriculture and food-feed production.  However the application of the technology has proven to be controversial.  Current EU legislation defines a GMO as \"an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and\/or natural recombination\".<\/p> <p>  According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, 18 million farmers in 28 countries planted more than 181 million ha of GM crops in 2014.  Cultivation is concentrated in five countries with 90% planted in the USA, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada.  The main GM crops cultivated are maize, soyabean, cotton and oilseed rape.  While herbicide-tolerance and insect resistance are the predominant traits of the commercialised GM crops, there is an increasing spectrum of traits emerging, which include drought and salinity tolerance, yield enhancement through more efficient use of nutrients, disease resistance, improved nutrition content and improved food safety profile. <\/p> <p>  The cultivation and marketing of GM crops within the EU is strictly controlled by EU-wide legislation which has been jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  In the past 15 years the European Union has introduced a suite of regulations governing the safety, labelling, marketing and traceability of GM crops, food and feed.  Central to these regulations are four main legislative acts, namely: directive (2001\/18\/EC), which outlines the conditions for the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and sets out aspects of the risk assessment required prior to their release; Regulation 1829\/2003 which sets out the conditions for authorisation, supervision and marketing of GMOs for food and feed use; Regulation 1830\/2003 establishes the conditions for labelling and traceability of GM food and feed; and the contained use directive (2009\/41\/EC), which lays down measures for the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms.<\/p><p>The main aim of the legislation is to give the consumer a clear choice, through labelling, between GM and non-GM products and the confidence that all GM products placed on the EU market are safe for human and animal consumption and to the environment and can be traced back to source.<\/p><p> The authorisation procedure is that GM crops, food and feed are subject to a comprehensive risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority before they are authorised for use in the EU.  The risk assessment is designed to ensure GM crops and GM food and feed do not pose a risk to human health, animal health and the environment.  Preparation of an application to have a new GM crop cultivated in the EU or to have a new GM food or feed derived from a GM crop authorised for import and use in the EU is the responsibility of the breeder.  The application must be prepared according to standard guidelines established by EFSA and the OECD.  Experts in EFSA then carry out a risk assessment of the data presented in the application to ensure the GM crop, food and feed are safe for human health, animal health and the environment.<\/p><p> Following a favourable opinion from the EFSA, the European Commission presents a draft proposal to the EU regulatory committee on GMOs, that is, the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,  SCoPAFF, for vote on approval or rejection of the application for authorisation in the EU.  If no qualified majority is achieved for or against the application, the proposal is submitted to the higher level appeals committee.  If no majority is achieved at the appeals committee, the proposal reverts to the Commission for final decision.<\/p><p> To date, no application to authorise a GM crop for cultivation or for food and feed use has received a qualified majority at standing committee level.  In general, votes have been split approximately 12 in favour, 12 against and three or four abstentions.  The decision then reverts to the Commission which has generally approved the applications in line with standard EU policy.  Once a GM product is approved, the authorisation is valid for ten years.  To date, 57 GMOs have been approved for food and feed use in the EU.  However, only one of these, namely, MON810, an insect resistant maize, has been approved for cultivation.  Of the 57 approved, 30 are maize, 12 soya bean, ten cotton, four oilseed rape and one sugar beet.<\/p><p> The GM maize, MON810, is cultivated in five EU member states, namely, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia.  The total GM maize plantings in the EU in 2014 amounted to 143,000 hectares, with over 90% of this cultivated in Spain.  All applications for authorisation by the EU to place food and feed products consisting of or containing genetically modified ingredients in the EU market are considered individually following a comprehensive evaluation of the GMO by the EFSA.  In line with Government policy of adopting a positive but precautionary approach on biotechnology, a common voting position is adopted by Ireland for food and feed on the basis of a favourable opinion from the EFSA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p> The comprehensive risk evaluation procedure adopted by the EU has given rise to a time lag between the EU and third country authorisations, thus leading to trade difficulties between the EU and the main global exporting countries of GM crops, namely, the USA, Brazil, Argentina and Canada.  New GM crops that are authorised and cultivated in North and South America are generally not authorised for a period of one to two years later in the EU, leading to rejection of unauthorised shipments of maize and soya bean at EU ports.  Rejection of these shipments occurs due to the zero tolerance in the EU of unauthorised GM crops.  This disparity in authorisation timing, known as asynchronous authorisation, has given rise to considerable difficulties for the Irish and EU trade, and alteration to the EU authorisation process as suggested in the current proposal is likely to give rise to similar difficulties in the shipment of feed materials to Ireland.<\/p><p> Regulation of GM crops in Ireland is shared between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Health.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has primary responsibility for the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment as governed by Directive 2001\/18\/EC.<\/p><p>The Department is also responsible for the authorisation of GMO trials, both field and contained-use, including genetically modified micro-organisms.  The EPA assists the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in risk assessment and the setting of conditions for the conduct of the trials, as well as conditions for deliberate release.  The Department of Health has responsibility for the use of GMOs as regards food.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for the import and use of GM feed, as well as control measures for cultivation post-commercialisation, should that arise.<\/p><p> The European Union is only 35% self-sufficient in protein supplies for animal feed.  Soybean is the most favoured vegetable protein because of its nutritional efficacy and competitive cost.  In Ireland up to 80% of animal feed for ruminants is provided by grass, hay and silage, complemented, where appropriate, by compound feeds.  In the case of pigs and poultry, virtually all of their nutrition is derived from compound feeds.  The Irish cereal harvest is generally in the region of 2.2 millions tonnes per annum, of which approximately 1.7 million tonnes are used for animal feed, with the remainder being used in the food and drinks sector.<\/p><p> On average, Ireland imports 3 million tonnes of animal feed materials per annum.  In addition, approximately 1.7 million tonnes of home-grown cereals are used in the production of feed, bringing the total usage of feed materials to approximately 4.7 million tonnes.  Some 66% of these feed materials is used for ruminant feed - 16% for pigs, 12% for poultry and 6% for other animals.  Of the 3 million tonnes imported, approximately 55% is sourced from third countries outside the European Union, mainly Argentina, the United States, Ukraine, Canada and Brazil.  More than 1.2 million tonnes of soy and maize GM products were imported into Ireland for animal feed in 2014, constituting 40% of total feed imports.  The main commodities imported are maize and maize by-products, soybean meal and soy hulls and rapeseed meal.  Up to 90% of the soybean and maize products imported from Argentina, Brazil and the United States is derived from genetically modified crops.  Significant quantities of non-GM maize and oilseed rape meal are imported from continental Europe, including Ukraine.<\/p><p> Ireland is especially dependent on feed imports relative to other EU member states in that approximately two thirds of the feed materials marketed here are imported, compared with, for instance, 37% in the United Kingdom, 27% in France and 26% in Germany.  The pig and poultry sectors which employ almost 10,000 personnel in production and processing are particularly impacted on, as soybean is an essential ingredient in the formulation of these feed rations.<\/p><p> The Food and Feed Chain Coalition, FFC, which represents ten EU member organisations from different parts of the food and feed chain has expressed its opposition to the proposal from the European Commission, as has the Irish Grain and Feed Association, IGFA.  The animal feed industry in Ireland considers the import of significant quantities of soybean and maize from North and South America where GMO cultivation is widespread as essential to satisfy the protein fraction in animal nutrition.  Trading difficulties have arisen in the past owing to zero tolerance of unauthorised GM crops.  Further difficulties with such imports are likely to be exacerbated in the future as an increasing number of GM crop varieties are cultivated in North and South America in advance of authorisations being achieved in the European Union.  In previous years the United States has delayed the cultivation of new GM varieties to ensure compatibility with EU authorisations, but this practice is increasingly difficult to implement owing to the widespread adoption of stacked or multiple GM traits in GM crops.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and will be happy to answer questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ryan and invite Mr. Canning to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#L00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433854800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving the Department the opportunity to speak about the proposal to amend the current regulation and the basis for it.  The Commission is proposing to allow member states in certain circumstances to restrict or prohibit the use of authorised genetically modified food or feed in their territories.<\/p><p>It is proposed that member states be allowed to make use of this &quot;opt-out&quot; provision, subject to their being able to justify the restriction or prohibition on a case by case basis.<br\/><br\/>Under the existing provisions laid down in Regulation EC 1829\/2003, only authorised GM food or feed may be placed on the EU market and when present in a food or feed at greater than a figure of 0.9%, it must be labelled accordingly.  The current regulation also sets out a centralised procedure for the safety assessment and authorisation of food and feed from a GM source.  Even where a genetically modified organism, GMO, or a product derived from a GMO is to be used only in animal feed, its safety with respect to human food is also assessed and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The authorisation procedure put in place by the regulation ensures the products concerned will not pose a risk to human and animal health and the environment.  The authorisation of a GM food or feed in the European Union begins with a safety assessment carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, a risk assessment body established under the regulation.  Each application is assessed on a case by case basis and once the dossier has been deemed complete by the EFSA, it forms the basis for an authorisation or rejection proposal which is then presented by the Commission to member states to be voted on at standing committee level.  <br\/><br\/>As our colleague has outlined, since the entry into force of Regulation EC 1829\/2003, a qualified majority of member states has never been achieved either for or against authorisation of a GM food or feed.  The applications are, therefore, sent to the appeals committee to try to reach a majority decision.  Where this is not achieved, an application is sent to the Commission for final decision.  The Commission has stated the reasons given by many member states to justify abstaining in votes or rejecting applications are usually not based on science but on other considerations.  Where there is scientific evidence demonstrating that an authorised GM product is likely to pose a risk to human or animal health or the environment, the regulation allows the Commission or member states to adopt emergency measures restricting or prohibiting the placing on the market of the product.  This is the only basis allowed to member states to restrict the placing of GM food or feed on the market once a product has been  authorised.<br\/><br\/>The Commission is proposing to amend Regulation EC 1829\/2003 to provide that individual member states may, subject to certain conditions, adopt measures to restrict or prohibit the use of GM food and feed on part or all of their territories.  There is a series of caveats set out in the recitals to the proposal, which are as follows: the member state must be able to justify the prohibition or restriction on the grounds of an overriding public interest in accordance with Article 36 of the treaty as developed by the case law of the European Court of Justice; the measures must not infringe Article 34 of the treaty on the free movement of goods; the measures must be reasoned and compatible with the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination between national and non-national products; as stated, the reasons for prohibition or restriction cannot be linked with health risks as they are already dealt with centrally by the EFSA and the emergency measures covered in Regulation EC 1829\/2003; and the measures cannot be used to prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of products containing less than 0.9% GM material, which products are already dealt with under the existing regulation.  Essentially, this means that products containing adventitious or technically unavoidable amounts of GM material are not required to be labelled as containing GM material.<br\/><br\/>Under the new provisions, the prohibition or restriction of a GM product by a member state may only occur after the GM product has been authorised.  This process will thus not affect the procedure for authorisation of GM food and feed which will remain valid for the whole of the European Union.  Once a GM product is authorised in the European Union, it may be marketed in all member states, including Ireland.  GM food ingredients authorised in the European Union include soya bean, maize, oilseed rape, cotton, sugar beet and starch potato.  Under the current regulation, if more that 0.9% of a food or ingredient is derived from a GM source, it must be labelled accordingly.<br\/><br\/>GM foods are not generally sold in Ireland, a situation similar to that in other EU member states.  An evaluation of the EU legislative framework for food and feed published in June 2010 by DG Sanco suggests this is because food markets have evolved towards the dominant use of non-GM supply chains.  Monitoring of the Irish marketplace has been co-ordinated by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland since 2001, which ensures only authorised GM foods or ingredients are on the market and that consumers are allowed to purchase or avoid these products by virtue of accurate labelling.<\/p><p>Sampling and analysis of GM foods are mainly concentrated on processed food containing soya, maize or rice as these are foods where GM ingredients are more commonly found.  Inspection results are published on the FSAI website and demonstrate that only a small proportion of foods analysed contain GM ingredients but that these are generally authorised GM ingredients and are below the labelling threshold of 0.9%. <\/p><p> To date, Ireland has always adopted a science-based but precautionary approach to GM foods while consumer choice has been ensured by adequate monitoring of the marketplace.  This new Commission proposal provides member states with a unilateral means of prohibiting or restricting the marketing of EU-authorised GM food and feed ingredients in their territories without having to resort to emergency measures provided for under article 34 of the regulation.  The proposal does not define the reasons that can be invoked by member states other than to stipulate that they cannot be based on perceived risks to human or animal health or the environment.  The Department of Health is of the view that the provisions of the legislation currently in place for authorising GM food and feed in the EU provide adequate science-based safeguards in the context of human and animal safety and the environment. <\/p><p> We are available for any questions members may have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gregory Canning","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433854800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Ar an ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba maith liom bu&iacute;ochas a tabhairt duith a Chathaoirleach for inviting the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss COM (2015) 177 pertaining to GM food and feed.  At the end of this opening statement, I would be happy to answer any questions that members might have and if I am unable to provide answers today, I will arrange for the relevant information to be forwarded to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The EPA is the competent authority in Ireland for the implementation of the genetically modified organisms, GMO, regulations on the contained use in laboratories and the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.  This could be for a field trial or a clinical trial in hospital.  The agency was nominated as the competent authority to administer the regulations in Ireland and the commencement date for implementation was 1 January 1995.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for national policy for GMOs and the environment.  I think one of the previous papers said that it is the EPA which gives consent for both contained use and field trials.  Other regulatory agencies involved in the regulation of GMOs in Ireland include the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which is the body for GM medicines and medicines derived from GMOs.<\/p> <p>  What are GMOs?  GMOs are defined as bacteria, viruses, fungi, plant and animal cells, plants and animals that are capable of replication or of transferring genetic material in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating or natural recombination.  In the last 39 years, the development and use of GMO or genetic engineering, GE, technology has brought many useful applications in health care in the form of new pharmaceuticals, vaccines and new methods of diagnosing disease.  An example is insulin which has saved millions of lives over the past 30 years.  Insulin is important for people who suffer from diabetes and 100% of it is now made using GM technology.  This technology is also making a major impact in the investigation of crime, waste treatment, environmental clean up and other areas.<\/p> <p>  The EPA's remit is to implement the GMO regulations in Ireland pertaining to the contained use and deliberate release into the environment.  What does the licensing of GMO users in Ireland mean?  In practice, what this means is that anyone who wants to use a GMO in a laboratory or in a field or clinical trial, which involves deliberate release into the environment, must first obtain a licence from the EPA.  By 1 June 2015, there were 579 entries on the register of GMO users in Ireland, more than 95% of which are contained users.  A total of 98% of this use relates to genetically modified micro-organisms, GMMs, that are used in laboratories and are categorised as low- risk categories - class 1-2 GMM - and GM animals which are used for medical research.  Quite a number of researchers in Ireland use GM mice.  Class 1 encompasses researchers looking at bacteria that produce antibiotics.<\/p><p>The class 2 category includes the use of genetically modified viruses for the production of vaccines.<\/p><p> Currently, there is one GM field trial that has been ongoing since 2012.  This relates to a GM potato which is tolerant to the late potato blight fungus.  This has been planted for the past four years and next year will be the last year of planting.  This work is being conducted at Oak Park by Teagasc and is part of a larger European-funded project called AMIGA to assess the impacts of GM crops on the agro-ecosystems.  Dr. Ewen Mullins from Teagasc was a speaker at our 2013 conference, details of which I will outline presently.  He has updated the relevant slide.  Committee members can see the slide on the right, which shows the position after two years of planting.  On the left side members can see the devastation caused by the late potato blight fungus.  To combat this disease Irish farmers would have to use approximately 15 to 20 sprays of fungicide per year.  The slide on the right shows the GM plant.  It has a single gene from a wild potato.  I imagine committee members can see the potential of this technology.  Every picture tells a story, mar a deirtear.<\/p><p> The EPA has no remit for GM food and feed in Ireland and, therefore, the agency has no comment to make on this proposal.  However, I wish to inform the committee of some of the outcomes of a conference held by the EPA in 2013.  The outcomes are still pertinent to this day.  The aim of the conference was to emphasise the relevance and importance of GM technology to Irish research, industry and the economy.  An EPA report, \"Synopsis of issues arising from the conference - Regulation and Use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in technology in Ireland\" was sent electronically to all Members in January this year for information purposes.  No doubt all committee members have read the document.  I re-sent it to the committee last week in electronic form.<\/p><p> What were the main outcomes?  We had several international speakers from the European Food Safety Authority and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment in the United Kingdom.  From the United States we had an NGO speaker and we had a speaker from the IFA as well and so on.  I will summarise the main points.  It was evident that Irish farmers rely on the importation of animal feed derived from GM soya and corn.  In 2012 more than 50% of imported grain was derived from GM soya and GM maize.  In fact, the EU is only 35% sufficient in animal protein and the remainder must be imported.  This means approximately 1,800 million ha must be planted outside the European Union to provide vegetable protein, an incredible area of land.  Irish farmers were concerned that they might become less competitive because they had to pay a higher price for imported commodity crops.  This is still pertinent for the current proposal before the committee.<\/p><p> Another outcome of the conference was the evidence that the use of GM technology is helping to drive Ireland's exports.  GM technology has the propensity to create more jobs in the bio-pharma sector.  For the first time Irish researchers now have the capability to carry out clinical trials on patients in hospitals using GM vaccines and other medicinal products.  Basically, this derives from Government policies in recent years.  The money has been spent on research and much of this has now been transferred to hospitals to determine whether those vaccines or drugs have any efficacy.<\/p><p> Nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies are located in Ireland and this has created over 24,000 jobs.  Fully 50% of our exports derive from the life sciences, including the bio-pharma sector.  The sector is very important.  Many companies are moving away from chemical synthesis of drugs in favour of biologics.  This is more efficacious and environmentally friendly because the companies are not using chemicals.<\/p><p> A further outcome was the general agreement that the EU regulatory system pertaining to GM crops is cumbersome, expensive, not proportionate to the risks and not functioning properly for the workings of the Internal Market.  Already there is evidence that this dysfunctional regulatory system is responsible for bio-tech job losses in the European Union.  Two multinational companies have already given up on the EU regulatory regime for cultivation purposes.  In 2012, the German giant, BASF, announced that it had halted the development of commercialisation of GM crops in Europe and moved its bio-tech research and development operations lock, stock and barrel, including growth chambers, greenhouses and laboratories, to the United States.<\/p><p>The firm cited consumer and political resistance to transgenic plants or GM crops in Europe for its decision.  Two weeks ago I heard from my German colleagues that Bayer and KWS have moved from Germany over the past year and a half.  KWS is a more traditional plant breeding company and it moved half of its research and development facilities to the United States.  The German authorities did say they were very concerned about the potential for job losses.  <\/p><p> I will outline another conclusion.  There was a discussion on why Ireland should support a product and phenotype-based regulatory system, rather than the current process-based regulatory system.  It was felt the former might better serve EU farmers and SMEs.  Such an initiative would make sense, bearing in mind that there are herbicide tolerant crops in the EU at present that are unregulated even though they have the same potential concerns as their GM counterparts.  These conventional herbicide tolerant crops are now available to Irish farmers.  They are also called clearfield crops.  Basically, it means one can select herbicide tolerance using traditional plant breeding.  However, they have the same potential concerns with the fallout from the GMO regulations.  Canada uses a product-based regulatory which regulates everything, if one knows what I mean. <\/p><p> The word \"proportionality\" is key when it comes to the implementation of the GMO deliberate release directive 2001\/18\/EC.  It was the opinion of some of the speakers at the conference that the EU is overly concerned about the potential risks from using GM crops and is not sufficiently concerned about the environmental harm that invasive species do to ecosystems.  The two species of Gunnera or wild rhubarb and Japanese knotweed are a huge problem.  I have no doubt that they have caused environmental harm.  They have adversely affected biodiversity by affecting whole ecosystems and habitats, especially in some parts of the west of Ireland.  If one drives from Achill Island, which is my own part of the woods, up to Bangor Erris and south to Clifden, one will see that wild rhubarb has completely taken over ecosystems.  Japanese knotweed has done the same in Kerry, Wexford and other counties and is very dangerous.  Unfortunately, it appears that no one is doing anything to eradicate these invasive species.  Twenty years ago people were concerned that GM crops would be released into the ecosystem.  Ireland has a problem with invasive species and we seem to have taken our eye off the ball.<\/p><p> Another matter of paramount importance is how the new techniques for plant-breeding and the genetic modification of microbes will be regulated at EU level.  The relevant EU directives are 25 years old but GM technology has come on in leaps and bounds.  At present scientists can turn a gene on or off in a plant or microbe without the insertion of new DNA or protein in the plant.  The big question in Europe is how can we regulate such products.  If we regulate them as GMOs then other jurisdictions, such as the United States, will probably deregulate.  Such a scenario would leave SMEs in the European Union with huge concerns, as I alluded to previously.<\/p><p> It is likely that some of the new techniques currently under scrutiny will not be regulated as GMOs in other jurisdictions.  The product or phenotype-based regulatory system might overcome the problem of how to regulate the new techniques.  Changing to a product-based system would bring the EU regulatory system in line with our main trading partners and would not distort trade.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I hope I have given the committee an overview of GMO regulation in Ireland.

Genetic modification is an emerging theory which brings potential but also  limitations and dangers.  The use of GMOs is a concern for consumers.  It may not be the topic of many conversations but, ultimately, it will reflect in the foodstuffs that consumers eat, whether that is in the form of animals fed with GM processed foods or the GM processing or engineering of human foodstuffs.<\/p><p>There is a cultural dynamic at play here also.  As humans do we want to eat food that is natural and that comes from traditional agricultural methods or do we want to eat food that is engineered in some other way, through human, technological or biotechnological intervention?  This is the question for consumers.  While we can dress up the issue as providing the consumer with a choice, we must reflect on the cultural dynamic before moving on and saying that by providing GM foods, we are giving consumers a choice.<\/p><p> If we accept that argument, we are in some way giving in to the major companies, Monsanto and other global institutions, which are positioning themselves on the world stage to be larger than countries, by acquiring the possibility of feeding nations through genetically modified food and feedstuffs, whether for human or animal consumption, in the future.  This scares me.  I come from a food science background and am well aware of some of the research which has been carried out over the past 15 or 20 years by companies such as Monsanto.  I have friends who work in that sector, in biotechnology and elsewhere, who are making a healthy living from it.  However, what scares me is that we do not know where it is going to end.<\/p><p> Much research has been done in this area by PhD students and others, some of which has been positive and some negative.  The ship is out in regard to the future.  I agree there will be a huge global demand for food because of increasing populations.  How are we as policy makers to prepare to meet that demand?  Should we give in to the fact that multinational players can provide food or should we consider more conventional, traditional methods of providing food?  As a committee representing the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I presume we would promote the more traditional system of providing or developing foodstuffs first.  <\/p><p> I will now put some questions to the witnesses, in particular to the representatives from the Department.  Reference was made to the demand for genetically modified feedstuffs.  The last slide shown by Dr. McLoughlin showed that more than 50% of imported grain here is derived from GM soya and GM maize products.  Is that the case?  To what extent do our feed and grain manufacturing plants use GM sourced raw materials currently?  In the eyes of the Department, what is the current situation and what does it expect it to be in future, taking on board the available agricultural land here?  What efforts are being made to try to promote and protect our traditional farming, grain and tillage farmers, in developing their enterprises rather than import grain?  Has the Department considered doing this?  What is the position regarding issues such as the environment, health, ethics and declining rural areas versus the importation of GM sourced grain?  These are just general questions.<\/p><p> In regard to the European proposals, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health seem to have taken the view that the proposals are somewhat prohibitive.  Is that due to the fact that they are predominantly more process specific than product specific and that countries have difficulties in opting out?<\/p><p>Article 34 states:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>member states may adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use of products referred to in Article 3(1) and 15(1) authorised pursuant to this Regulation provided that such measures are:<br \/><br \/>(a) reasoned and based on compelling grounds in accordance with Union law which shall, in no case, conflict with the risk assessment carried out pursuant this Regulation;<br \/><br \/>(b) proportional and non-discriminatory.<\/blockquote>I presume if both Departments are not accepting where the Commission is coming from, submissions have been made to the Commission.  Has either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine raised a concern at Council level ?  What has been the level of dialogue?  Is there a view within the Department of Health on health implications of genetically modified sources or processed foodstuffs coming into the human food chain in Ireland?  Ultimately, it will end in the human food chain if we are sourcing raw material to be fed to animals.  What is the view of the Department of Health on some of the conflicting research material, both within Europe and the United States, with respect to the implications for human health from that?<br\/><br\/>These are a few general points but it is a large and evolving area.  It is a financially lucrative area, which worries me.  While accepting that we need genetically modified foods to feed our animals in this country because we are not self-sufficient in Europe or Ireland, we are only providing ourselves with one option.  Have other options been considered, such as helping our own grain farmers and industry to develop?  I touched on what Ministers have done at Council level as I would like to know what has been happening there.<br\/><br\/>A proposal came before us at the last committee, COM 2015\/0093, but has there been any initial feedback from the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Commission on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#P00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their contributions today.  Like many citizens, I share concerns about this at the outset.  There are two aspects, with the first being the safety of genetically modified produce, while the crucial issue is the motivation behind many of the main producers of genetically modified foods.  When we consider the five countries involved - the United States, Canada, India, Argentina and Brazil - and the companies, such as Monsanto, as named by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, with a control factor, the food chain of the world could be in the hands of a few people.  That may be the motivation.  The consequences for generations to come could be startling.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health is responsible for examining the use of genetically modified organisms for food purposes.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for examining the import and use of genetically modified feed and the control measures for cultivation post-commercialisation if that arises.<\/p><p>Is there joined-up thinking?  Is there a forum whereby there is a linkage between the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the safety aspect of it?<\/p><p> On cross contamination, trials have been carried out in this country on growing GM produce alongside the natural production of food with regard to cross contamination, the effects of it and how it affects the natural produce.  What is the percentage of the contamination as a consequence of that?  I believe Spain produces 90% of GM production in Europe.  Again, we are talking about very low income economies being very vulnerable to being, perhaps, exploited for that purpose.  Also, there is the fact that climate would be a factor, because Portugal is one of the bigger producers as well.  There is also Romania and the Czech Republic.  Countries such as Germany, France and the more affluent countries of the European Union have severe restrictions on it.  That poses a question.  Abuse is probably the wrong word, but the weaker and more vulnerable economies are being used for production and perhaps being exploited for that purpose.<\/p><p> With regard to unauthorised GM crops, is there any mechanism to prevent them finding their way into what is described as the authorised sector?  We saw what happened across Europe when there was the scandal last year with horse meat in the various different chains and how easily that could be done.<\/p><p> Regarding the tests being carried out by the European Food Safety Authority and so forth, who carries out those tests on behalf of the food safety authority?  Who has the contract for doing that?  Who pays for it?  If companies are carrying out tests on behalf of a food safety authority, there is the issue of the bona fides of the people who carry them out.  Where does the funding for it come from?  Is it paid for by the European taxpayer?  Do any contributions come from the sector itself, such as the big production companies in GM production?  Again, with regard to the safety point of view, can the Department of Health representatives, in particular, say in absolute terms that they are quite satisfied with the safety of that food, be it in the food chain or the feed chain?  The fact that it is in the feed chain automatically means it finds its way into the food chain because we are eating it.  Will they give their views on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#R00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  It is hard to know where to start with this except to be direct in my approach.  I have severe reservations about genetically modified material for a number of reasons.  I qualified as a biochemist and at that stage, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the human genome was sequenced.  I did a PhD on homology modelling, which was something similar to what we are considering here.  When one talks about the genome people get the impression that it is one straight line of sequences, but it comes together in a three dimensional model.  The issue I have is that when we tamper with sequences at one part of the genome it could touch, promote, start or do something with the sequences on the other end, which are far away from each other but come close together in three dimensional structure.<\/p><p> We know the potential of virus sequences, which are short, but there are many sequences which, because we do not know what they can do, are redundant.  While GM enables us to identify and put in traces that are beneficial we could at some stage, because we do not fully understand it, open up something that we do not want to open up.  The point I am trying to make is that we are not long into GM in terms of the polymerase train reaction having been only developed in the 1980s.  While there are many advantages to GM we need to be cautious to a certain extent.<\/p><p> In regard to the statement that we must not conflict with the EFSA's risk assessment, if we cannot conflict with its risk assessment are we not then operating with one arm behind our back?  It was also stated that GMO is as \"safe\" as conventional use but, by way of illustration, there were many statements made a couple of years ago to the effect that our banks were fully capitalised.  One cannot enter into something by putting down constants that may not be correct.  In regard to the availability of GM crops on which glycocate can be sprayed, the argument has been made by many people that glycocate, or roundup as it is often called, if used on soil for long periods ruins the structure of the soil.  I am a farmer.  I would use glycocate only sparingly bearing in mind soil structure.  <\/p><p> Reference was made to labelling.  We cannot even get our country of origin labelling right.  I would suggest that we get that labelling right before entering into this area.  Another statement made earlier is that experts in the EFSA carry out a risk assessment of the data presented.  Is the EFSA provided with all or only part of the data?  <\/p><p> Reference was also made to trade difficulties.  I am a tillage farmer.  The current difficulty for the tillage industry is the recent production of three of the largest ever world harvests, as a result of which farmers are going out of business.  The price of grain today is lower than it was 25 years ago.  There will be no need to worry about grain production in Ireland into the future if this continues.  That is a sad fact.  Tillage farmers in Ireland are relying on high yields to survive.  Only for the single farm payment many tillage farmers would be gone out of business.  That is the reality of grain production in Ireland.  In regard to the suggestion that we achieve higher yields to ensure lower prices, in a country like Ireland higher world production will put us at the mercy of importers and out of business.  <\/p><p> It was also stated that the EU is only 35% self sufficient in proteins.  Thankfully, following negotiations on the new single farm payment, a supplement of &euro;100 per acre is now being paid in respect of crops such as beans.  For the first time ever, I now grow beans and protein crops and will continue to do so.  Perhaps we should put more effort into growing protein crops in the EU rather than looking to America and other areas to supply us with GM products.  If we could manage to produce enough protein what is being proposed would be worthy of consideration.  Currently, no effort is being made to protect our tillage industry.  No effort is being made to make us different.  We cannot compete on scale but we can compete on quality.  We are about to accept the potential GM argument without first doing everything we can to increase protein production within the EU.  <\/p><p> It was also stated that member states must be able to justify prohibition on the grounds of overriding public interest, in respect of which five grounds are listed.  In my view, this restricts individual states' ability to object to GM foods if they have a concern.  I do not like the headlong rush into this.  The submission from the Department of Health ended with the following: \"The Department of Health's view is that the provisions of the legislation currently in place for GM feeds provide adequate science-based safeguards\".  I am not convinced the safeguards we have in place are adequate.<\/p><p> With regard to the EPA presentation, I agree that our biopharm industry is very valuable.<\/p><p>I do not have a difficulty with that.  It was stated that Irish farmers are concerned that they might become less competitive.  As matters stand, we are already less competitive.  Once one is losing money, it all becomes relative.  I do not believe that growing GM crops will lead to tillage farmers being any better off.  As a tillage farmer, I am of the view that the position will be quite the opposite.<\/p><p> In the context of proportionality, there appears to be a headlong rush into GM production.  Reference was made to potatoes and I am aware of the fabulous work being done at Oak Park.  However, it must be remembered that three or four years ago we were lucky to be in a position to export potatoes because there were just too many of them being grown here.  I would have welcomed it if representatives from the pesticide control service had been invited to appear before us today.  That service does great work and I would have liked to have heard its view on this matter.  In a nutshell, we like the country to be perceived as having a green image.  If the US and other countries throughout the world had segregated GM crops, there would be no problem.  What would be the position if we presented those who buy food for their families a distinct choice between whether they would prefer to buy a bag of regular potatoes or a bag of clearly labelled GM potatoes?  The concern that arises - be it right or wrong - is that people would go for the safer option.  We must be very careful in the context of rushing headlong into promoting GM production.  I remain of the view that there are still health concerns but I am willing to be persuaded - over time - that this is not the case.  I will only be convinced when we have a proper understanding of the science involved.<\/p><p> From a purely business point of view, increased world production will mean that there will be no cereal industry left in this country.  Our cereal industry is dying on its feet at present.  I am of the view, therefore, that Europe should be seeking to produce more and more protein in order to give us something which we badly need.  There was a fodder crisis in this country a number of years ago, which related to the fact that we were in expansion mode rather than that we were running out of protein.  The price of soya remains quite high and people have been complaining about that fact.  Perhaps by ensuring that we have an industry in this country, we can protect our selves from the vagaries of the markets in this regard.  It must be remembered that speculation in respect of cereals - including proteins - is what adds vastly to the price in many cases.  However, I accept that political instability also plays a part.  Those are my views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#S00200","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for coming before us and sharing their expertise.  This is an emotive issue and it is the use of the word \"modified\" that frightens people.  Genetics have been use for some time in the context of the development of crops and animals.  In the context of human health, superbugs have emerged against which existing antibiotics are useless.  As a result, new antibiotics have had to be developed and this has been achieved by means of modification.<\/p> <p>  We must ask whether there is a need for GM crops.  I am here to be enlightened and persuaded in that regard.  Will our guests indicate whether the world's population can be fed without the use of GM crops?  It was stated that we import 66% of the protein feeds we require for our animals.  Deputy Barry made the point that the price of crops in Ireland is being forced down as a result of the fact that other countries are in a position to produce GM crops.  In circumstances where existing regulations do not allow GM crops to be grown in a particular country, are the people who live there being placed at an unfair disadvantage?  Technically, it should be cheaper to produce a GM crop as a result of the need to use fewer pesticides, to engage in less husbandry, etc.  Under COM (2015) 177, it will be left to member states to decide whether they wish to allow the use of GM products.<\/p><p>I would welcome the views of the panel on whether the use of such products should be regulated by individual member states?  In such circumstances, the interpretation of regulation on the use of these products would be very open-ended.  <\/p><p> Reference was made in the EPA presentation to herbicide-tolerant, HT, and to GM.  Does herbicide-tolerant not technically also mean genetically modified in some way?  As I said earlier, in terms of food production, particular breeds of animals are being constantly improved through genetics, as are crops.  Years ago the only barley available on the market here was midas barley, in respect of which one got approximately a tonne and half per acre.  We now also have hybrid crops, such as spring barley, which is a genetically modified food, in respect of which production is approximately three to three and a half tonnes per acre.  Can the world survive without GM crops?  If not, should member states have the right to regulate on the introduction of such crops in their country?<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Barry's remarks in regard to GM on all food products.  Technically, beef produced here and enhanced through the use of imported protein, which is genetically modified, should be labelled as such.  Would that affect our green image and our standing as the best country in the world in terms of food traceability?  As I said, genetics results in better breeding.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the major players in this area, including the US, Canada, Argentina and Brazil.  It was also stated that Spain produces 90% of the GM maize MON81-10 produced in the EU.  Is that product exported from the EU or is it used in Spain in the production of feedlots and so on?  As I said, this is an emotive topic.  We are all aware of the many multinationals that engaged in trials in this area and were destroyed.  It is important all research in this area is completed and then made available to the public so that people can make up their own minds.  In my view, labelling in this regard is the way forward.  As I said, I am here to be persuaded.  I believe GM has a future in the world because I do not believe we will be able to feed the world population without additional production, which into the future will require genetically modified foods.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#U00200","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry has spoken about many of the issues on which I had intended to focus.  I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations, which were illuminating as well as informative.  I thank them for the effort they put into their presentations.<\/p> <p>  I have many reservations and bountiful scepticism about GMO based food and food crops.  I always believe that when dabbling with the unknown one must err on the side of caution.  Deputy Barry used his technical knowledge to outline what can happen when one intervenes in sequences and so on.  In such circumstances, one never knows what the outcome will be, which is a matter of great concern.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry is correct that the reason poor grain is being imported is profitability and that but for the single farm payment most grain farmers would be wiped out altogether.  Approximately 3 million tonnes of animal feed material is imported into Ireland each year.  More than 50% of this grain is derived from GM soya and GM maize.  Does anybody ever refer to this?<\/p><p> We talk about food labelling.  Is that referred to in any way in the context of labelling, given that a significant amount of feedstuffs for cattle and livestock already contains significant amounts of GM ingredients?  Where is that?  My colleague is right.  Trying to get the label of origin here has been something that defeated the European Commission.  Even though we have a new EU Commissioner I have no doubt that, regardless of how hard he tries, there will be obstacles in that regard.<\/p><p> We have received submissions from various groups saying that there were 17 varieties caught up in the system in the last Commission and that it is an incredible failure of the EU's GMO regulations and a disregard for the scientific opinion of the EFSA.  However, one must be very careful of opinions.  Is everything independent or is there a mad rush by strongly financed, muscular and well heeled companies because it is in their interests to promote this?  We must be very careful as one can throw out the baby with the bath water with respect to always trying to advance technology.  For whose benefit will it ultimately be?<\/p><p> Senator O'Neill asked a relevant question regarding where this fits into feeding the world's population.  It is an interesting question that somebody should try to address.  Is this what it is about or is there a different motive altogether?  A financial motive might well be driving this.<\/p><p> I have grave reservations, but this is a useful forum for the information being imparted by the witnesses today.  I remain sceptical and I would be difficult to persuade as to the merits, particularly given the rush.  We must know more and we must tread carefully before a final decision is made in this country.  Regarding our voting record at Commission level, how do we vote?  Do we vote in accordance with the science or do we make up our own minds?  What are the criteria that drive us to make our decisions?  Are they made on an individual basis or do we have a bloc view on this going forward?  Is it a policy view or is it individual?  It is important to know that as well.

To be clear, the proposal we are dealing with is to allow the individual member states to nationalise their decision on approved products that are GMO feeds for animal feed that are approved by the EFSA in the first instance.  We must be clear on what this COM is about.  There is a wider argument, but it does not have anything to do with products for the health or biopharma sectors, even though there are many in that area.  It strictly relates to feed of greater than 0.9%.  The fear from the IGFA, as I see it, is that it would un-level the playing field for member states if some states or administrations of the day might have a more restrictive approach to it than others.<\/p> <p>  It is inevitable that it will lead to more questions, as members have mentioned here, about any effort on the part of the EU to produce more proteins for animal feeds, non-GM proteins, in crop rotations and everything else.  It is inevitable that the discussion would go that way.

Ireland imports at total of 3 million tonnes of feed materials approximately per annum, of which 1.2 millions or 40% is made up of GM feed materials - soya bean and maize by-products, which are distiiller's dried grains and corn gluten.  The protein content of soya bean is more than 40% and the protein content of the other products is more than 20%.  These materials are used specifically to bolster the protein content of compound feeds.  The soya bean is particularly important for pigs and poultry.  One cannot use the distiller's dried grains or the corn gluten and, therefore, the pig and poultry industry is dependent on the soya bean.  That is a European wide situation regarding pigs and poultry.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the cultivation of alternative crops, as has been mentioned, there is a financial incentive of &euro;250 per hectare to grow beans, peas and sweet lupins.  A number of feed compounders are geared up to process those products.  They can be used to varying extents in the diets of animals.  Peas can be used for pigs and poultry and beans and lupins can be used for dairy cattle.<\/p><p>Of course, the relative use of those protein supplements versus soya bean, corn gluten or distillers grains always is a cost factor.  There is another issue of the quantity of peas and beans that one can grow in Ireland, given the harvest conditions and given the soil conditions that are required.  I believe that deals with the aspect the Senator raised in this regard.<\/p><p> The Senator asked a question about any submissions that might have been made at this stage.  This current proposal is relatively new and only came out on 22 April.  It will come before the Council next week and that will be the first stage.  It also will come before the European Parliament next week.  Following on from that level, the procedure is that it will go down to a working group from the Council and it will go down to a rapporteur from the Parliament.  We will then be in a co-decision process, which will come later on.  If one likes, it is a rather long process and at this stage, and we are only at the very start of it.  We already have received the views of the Irish Grain and Feed Association which has made clear its views on this proposal.  Obviously, our Department will be interested in the views of this joint committee when members finish their deliberations.  At present, we are at the early stages.

This is a relatively small proposal, but its brevity does not mean simplicity.  It will have to be worked through.  Eventually the Council will reach an agreed position through negotiations.  It will pass from the Council working party to the group of permanent representatives of member states who will decide whether they have reached an agreed position that can be put to Ministers.

Over 90% of the soya bean cultivated in the USA, Brazil and Argentina is genetically modified.  The option of sourcing non-genetically modified soya bean from there is not available.  In addition, the amount of soya bean grown within the European Union at the moment is relatively small.  It is mainly grown in Italy, Hungary, France, Austria and one or two other countries.  They utilise all the soya bean that they grow themselves.  In the case of the pig, poultry and high-performance dairy herds, there is no option to replace that protein with any other protein source because there is only a given supply of oil seed rape or beans, to which Deputy Barry referred.  Beans are an excellent protein source for ruminants, particularly for beef cattle etc.  However, it is not of the same quality of protein as soya bean.

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the matter of bio-safety research.  Over a 25 year period the EU has spent &euro;300 million of taxpayers' money looking at bio-safety research in respect of food safety, environmental safety and safety in laboratories.  The research was published in 2010 by the then Commissioner, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Some of this research was carried out by universities in Ireland.  It was all independent research.  The results showed that GM technologies <i>per se<\/i>are no more dangerous than conventional crop breeding.<br\/><br\/>Another point was raised in respect of field trials and gene flow.  We had a number of field trials with herbicide-tolerant sugar beets in the 1990s.<\/p><p>The EPA looked very closely at the results in subsequent years when the sugar beet was planted.  We did not see the emergence of any tolerance to related weed species.  Unfortunately, we have no sugar beet industry now.<br\/><br\/>The current Teagasc trial is looking at indicators for biodiversity.  Again, this particular trial is funded by EU taxpayers.  The trial is comparing different types of management, i.e. integrated pest management.  It is also looking at Sarpo Mira, a naturally tolerant potato variety, compared to GM and non-GM varieties.  The results will come out in 2016 or around that time.  Of course, that gene came from a potato.  It was what is called a cisgenic potato.<br\/><br\/>A committee member asked whether this was new.  GM technology has been occurring for thousands of years.  I am referring to genetic modification <i>per se<\/i>in plants and animals.  Let us consider the wheat crop we have today.  It is not comparable to the wheat crop from 100 years ago, for example.  Again, there is intervention by plant breeders and the use of technologies like chemical mutagenesis.  As I mentioned, I believe these new techniques will circumvent the acronym GMO.  This is because we will not be able to differentiate between whether the resulting apple from an apple tree will have any new trait.  There will be no new DNA protein because of how the technology has moved.<br\/><br\/>Someone mentioned feeding the world.  Certainly, we need every tool in the toolbox.  We are experiencing climate change.  Certain pathogens are emerging in Ireland, including Schmallenberg, the virus that effects abortion in sheep.  That came in approximately ten years ago.  There is also ash dieback disease.  Can we actually manage without this technology?  Let us consider what has happened with the Ebola virus and how it was treated.  It was by using GM technology in Sierra Leone.  We need to look very carefully at it.

Mr. Lohan mentioned that we do not have alternatives for protein at present, and he is correct.  We met the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine one year ago.

Whatever price we wanted to throw at it, we could not get it.  There was a necessity that we should look long-term at increasing our production of protein.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lohan is correct.  The essential amino acids in soyas are better than in beans.  I was in Hungary last week as part of an Oireachtas delegation.  Those we spoke to shared many of the concerns we have.  They are not fans of GM produce.  They are concerned although they might be persuaded in future, like all of us.  It struck me that in the long term we should consider encouraging the profitable production of the likes of soya in countries where it can be done GM-free.  We would produce far more beans in this country if we were encouraged to do it.  It is very easy and the market will follow it.  If farmers believe there is profitability in a crop, they will grow it well.  Some parts of Europe could produce it.  All I am saying is that in the long term we should look for the possibility that we could have certain production without GM technology if it is perceived among the people who buy our products that they would prefer to have non-GM products.  At the moment there is such a mixed bag that we cannot make out what is what in respect of what is coming over on ships.  We are feeding GM crops.  What is the view of the delegation?

I will go through the presentation we have provided.  The first slide I want to mention relates to the challenges the company faces.  Bord na M&oacute;na currently faces a number of challenges forcing it to transform and diversify.  The first of these relates to Edenderry Power Limited, EPL, our power station in Edenderry, that is currently up for a judicial review which has delayed us achieving planning permission.  Historically, this station has been a 100% peat burning station but it is now a co-fired biomass-peat station.  In the future, this station will co-fire 37% biomass and 63% peat.  This creates both a challenge and an opportunity in the realm of biomass, an issue I will deal with shortly.<\/p> <p>  In view of the scale of the transformations required, we are currently engaged in a detailed LRC review process with the unions.  We have a total of 11 issues before the LRC and, where possible, I will explain what is involved in that process.  The carbon tax has had a severe impact on our fuel business.  Bord na M&oacute;na is the largest solid fuel company in Ireland and revenue from the fuel division is currently approximately &euro;107 million.  We have a significant market share on coal and on briquettes and the carbon tax in the two tranches that have come in have left us in an uncompetitive position, mainly driven by the enforcement of the carbon tax on a level playing field.  Last year, we paid &euro;8.7 million in carbon tax, 51% of the total carbon tax take of &euro;17.2 million, but we only have a 30% share of that market.  This is affecting our ability to sell our solid fuel products.<\/p> <p>  We have significant competition in all our divisions, but the division under the most pressure is the fuel business.  I will touch on that shortly.  Biomass offers a significant opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na.  We have had successful discussions with the ESB in regard to keeping the three peat-fired stations running post-2019 when the fuel purchase agreements and the PSO support run out.  I have worked very closely with the CEO of the ESB and we were able to announce this development to our workforce in the past month.<\/p><p>That creates an opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na with biomass supply and we will need approximately 1.2 million tonnes of biomass to supply those three stations plus a significant amount of other biomass for other businesses.  I will touch on that shortly.<\/p><p> To do that, the whole business needs to transform, and we are really in the middle of that now.  We must take down our cost-base significantly with peat production to allow us to compete on the open market with a commodity fuel, such as coal, oil and gas.  Up to now we have had guaranteed pricing under our fuel purchase agreements.  The one at Edenderry, EPL, ceases on 21 December and the agreement at the two ESB stations finishes at the end of 2019.  We must reduce our cost base significantly to allow those stations to continue to co-fire on a commercial basis.<\/p><p> That is a summary of the challenges facing the business.  The backbone of our strategic plan is to remain a major employer in the midlands.  Bord na M&oacute;na employs approximately 2,200 people today and we believe we have developed a plan that will continue to sustain that level of employment in the region up to 2030 and beyond.  We want to become the number one renewable energy supplier in Ireland.  We believe we can do that because of the land bank we have, and we have already invested significantly in wind farms.  We have three wind farms in operation, including two major investments that came on-stream last year, in Mount Lucas and Bruckana.  We also want to become the number one renewable home heating supplier in Ireland and the UK, and I will touch upon that in a few moments.  The position of number one landfill operator will become a strategic asset to the State, as a large number of landfills have closed over the past number of years.  We will still need landfill going forward for items that cannot be disposed of in incinerators.  I will speak to that more when we get to resource recovery.  The aspiration to be the number one biomass supplier is an Ireland Inc. opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, and I will touch on that later in the presentation.<\/p><p> Going back to Bord na M&oacute;na's roots in growing media, we have a number one position in Ireland and the UK on growing media and we are developing a professional horticultural product on a global basis.  I was fortunate enough to visit customers in Holland, Germany and Belgium last month, and Irish peat is regarded as the premier brand in the world.  It is a matter of how we get that brand to market.  Feedstock consists of all our peat harvesting, with peat used as energy in the three power stations and approximately 500,000 tonnes used in briquette factories.  It is also used in our horticulture business.  I have spoken about the challenges and the transformation solution, as spoken of in recent days, means we have to take &euro;24.2 million per annum from the cost of the business.  That should allow us to maintain the current employment level out to 2030 and beyond.<\/p><p> For the future, as a major employer in the midlands we believe we can transform Bord na M&oacute;na by 2030 into a significant producer of biomass as the peat reduces and peat energy runs out.  We believe we can sustain up to approximately 1,000 jobs in that biomass industry over the next decade.  We already have a skill-set and we have the largest tractor and excavator fleet in Europe.  Our employees are used to those skills and the transition, if we can get buy-in from the farming community, will allow Bord na M&oacute;na to be a major employer in the biomass industry.  The main component of this industry will be around willow and the mobilisation of the private forestry sector.  We have approximately 650 acres currently contracted under willow and that is yielding far in excess of our expectations in terms of tonnes per acre.  We have a financial proposition that will be attractive to farmers.  We have sent a package to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding our proposals to establish willow on a level footing with forestry, and we are hoping to get that included in this year's budget.<\/p><p> The other opportunity for us in biomass is the mobilisation of the private forestry sector.  We have had &euro;2.3 billion invested in private forestry grants since 1980, and private forestry is now becoming available for harvesting.  Very little has been done to date and through the Government initiative on BioEnergy, Ireland with Coillte, and with the addition of strategic partners, we believe we can grow that to approximately 500,000 tonnes by 2020 and 1 million tonnes of biomass by the middle of the next decade.<\/p><p>It will have a significant labour requirement, but we believe our current workforce engaged in peat harvesting is very capable of taking up the role.<\/p><p> We have two briquette factories in Derrinlough and Littleton.  Unfortunately, these factories are on an extended lay-off this year owing to a number of factors related to the carbon tax which we have mentioned, the fact that we had a very mild winter and that large stocks were available at the end of the production season.  However, we believe that with new products coming on stream, including a biomass briquette which will be 50% peat and 50% wood-based, there is a long-term future for these plants.  We hope to invest in two CHP plants, one in Littleton and one in Derrinlough, to replace existing infrastructure as a sign of our commitment.  We are also considering a new ovoid facility and will be seeking planning permission in Foynes later this month to get ready for the smokey coal ban if and when it is eventually imposed.  The facility will be capable of producing 200,000 tonnes of smokeless ovoid to replace bituminous coal.<\/p><p> On the horticulture side, we have two revenue streams through retail growing media and professional growing media.  Retail growing media are products used, for example, in Co Op stores, B&amp;Q and so forth, while professional growing media are high-end peat products used for professional growing, particularly in Holland and France.  They are large-scale specialist growers.  On the retail side, we are a major supplier both in Ireland and the United Kingdom, while on the professional side, there will be an opportunity into the future to develop our professional brand on a global basis.  It is not a skills set we possess, but the board has approved investment in it to allow us to develop the brand globally.<\/p><p> In terms of future investment, we must upgrade our existing facilities.  We must also invest in new professional bogs.  An energy peat bog is not the same as a professional horticulture bog.  We are examining our bank of peat to see which bogs we can develop to allow us to grow our professional business.<\/p><p> With regard to our renewable energy strategy, in 2014, for the first year ever, we produced more power from renewable energy resources than from traditional fossil fuels.  A total of 52% of our output came from renewable energy resources.  We have three wind farms and EPL which is co-firing at a figure of just over 30%.  We also use landfill gas on our Drehid site to generate power for approximately 8,000 homes.  It is our intention to invest in one wind farm per year for seven years, primarily on our own land.  I can discuss that matter further.  We are also ideally placed to capitalise on any roll-out of solar energy projects, for which our land is ideally suited.  When peat harvesting is exhausted, we will be left with a relatively flat land bank, with no vegetation, in remote areas.  We can roll out large-scale solar farms on this land.  I am pleased to announce that we will have a pilot 30 acre solar farm next year at Mount Lucas which will be capable of generating 5 MW.  Our plan in the longer term for wind farms is to co-locate solar and wind energy projects in order that during the summer when the wind is light we will maximise our output from our solar facility.  Our plan on the renewable energy side is to become a portfolio player by 2030.  We also believe we have a pivotal role to play in storage as the technology develops.  The ideal scenario for our land bank is that we will end up with wind farms co-located with solar and battery array facilities in order that we can take away the variability in renewable energy output.<\/p><p> On the resource recovery aspect, we have a very significant site in Drehid of 6,500 acres, with planning permission to 2028.  We have a number of facilities on site - landfill, landfill gas and a compost facility.  Our current capital programme will allow us to invest there.  We have planning permission for a 250,000 tonne MBT facility and are in the very early stages of looking at a gasification plant that will generate 15 MW of electricity.<\/p><p>The picture to the left of the slide is the MBT facility and to the right is the 15 MW power station.  A fuel derived from the MBT facility will be passed via conveyor into the gasification plant to generate the electricity.<\/p><p> Another possible major project for the Drehid facility is ash recovery and treatment.  This would involve us taking ash from the Covanta and Indaver incinerators and processing that ash to reclaim metals, with further treatment to allow it to be used in aggregates etc.  Once Covanta comes on stream, 220,000 tonnes per annum of ash will be processed between the two current incinerators in Ireland.<\/p><p> On land and community, which was our original mandate from the State, we have a significant land asset, with 80,000 hectares now in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  As per Government policy, we are working actively with Coillte on a number of work streams, including wind, BioEnergy Ireland, tourism and legal and shared services.  We believe there are significant opportunities, particularly in the tourism sector, to grow our relationship with Coillte.  Prior to applying for planning permission for any of this large-scale infrastructure, we engage with local communities to ensure there is clarity on all issues in order that we have their support before progressing.<\/p><p> From an employment perspective, as I mentioned earlier, Bord na M&oacute;na is a major employer, with 2,200 people spread across four divisions, soon to be five in terms of the division of the horticulture and fuels business.  We will only operate in those five divisions because they are our core businesses.  We believe we have developed a plan that will secure significant employment out to 2030, when we hope to be a different company, having replaced our peat business with large-scale biomass production.<\/p><p> In terms of our main requirements for the future, the first priority for us was to get the ESB agreement, which we have successfully done.  Keeping those power stations open is crucial to the future of employment in the midlands.  The two ESB stations support almost 1,000 jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na and the region.  Transformation is key.  We have to deliver savings of &euro;24.2 million if the ESB and EPL stations are to operate on a commercial basis.  There are many new business development opportunities within Bord na M&oacute;na.  If we deliver what we have outlined in our strategic plan, Bord na M&oacute;na revenue will grow from approximately &euro;430 million to approximately &euro;700 million over the next five to seven years.  This should ensure Bord na M&oacute;na remains a major employer in the midlands to 2030.

The role of Bord na M&oacute;na in terms of employment in the midlands counties for decades has been significant.  Regardless of where we come from, we all want to see that continue into the future.  We all very much welcome the diversification of Bord na M&oacute;na and the forward planning outlined by Mr. Quinn.<\/p> <p>  In terms of jobs, at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications attended by Mr. Quinn, he stated Bord na M&oacute;na needed to achieve savings of &euro;24 million.  Will that target, which is pretty steep, be achieved and, if so, how will that impact on existing staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#J00400","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>We have to achieve the &euro;24.2 million.  I will explain why it is necessary that we achieve those savings.  The price of energy is linked to gas, the price of which has dropped significantly over the past three or four years.  Other fuel types include coal, which has decreased from $130 in 2011 to $60 a tonne now, and oil.  We are all aware what has happened to oil.  At the end of this year the Edenderry facility will have to be able to compete with those commodity fuel stocks on the open market.  If we do not get the peat price down to compete with those, we do not get access to the grid, which means we do not generate power.<\/p><p>That same scenario happens with the two ESB stations at the end of 2019.  While there has been all this movement in the commodity fuel-feedstocks, peat has been guaranteed at a fixed price for the past 15 years under these fuel purchase agreements supported by the PSO but that will end and, therefore, we have to transform our business to drive our feedstock business to compete against these other fuel commodities.<\/p><p> Will we achieve the savings?  We have to.  The three stations will become what is called co-fired stations.  Each of the three stations will operate between 37% and 40% biomass and, therefore, the need for peat will drop by 40% across the stations.  We need to a drop of 200 people in employment across the business to do that.  We are in a fortunate position in that we will have 216 natural retirees over the period to 2020 and, therefore, if there are redundances, it will be a handful.  However, we also see an opportunity on the biomass side to grow employment in the sector.  We spent &euro;19 million on biomass last year.  That will grow to more than &euro;100 million by 2020 and we believe that will increase to between &euro;175 million and &euro;200 million by 2025.  That will generate a significant opportunity for the workforce if we can get the willow crops, for example, off the ground.  We are also exploring another scenario.  Our peat harvesting business is seasonal, running from May to September, but we are talking to a company at the moment which would take the workforce and deploy it in the private forestry sector during the six months of the winter timeframe.  While we might not secure increased head count, we might secure longer term employment all year round by moving to a biomass-peat mix in the power stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Mr. Quinn mentioned redundancies.

We were asked to examine the suitability of Bord na M&oacute;na land for anaerobic digestion, which we have done.  When one considers the position of Ireland versus, for example, Germany, where large-scale anaerobic digestion is used to produce biogas, it is obvious that the biggest problem we face arises in the context of the tariff.  We currently have the lowest tariff for anaerobic digestion in Europe.  The two challenges we face relate to the fact that we cannot make the use of digesters commercially viable and our ability to secure feedstock.  We have prepared a submission on the matter which we are going to send to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the next week or so.  We are of the view that there is scope for three regional anaerobic digesters of significant scale that would process somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of waste per annum in order to generate biogas but the provision of meaningful tariff support would be required to facilitate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Would Bord na M&oacute;na be in favour of changing the tariff in order to favour anaerobic digestion over wind energy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#L00700","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>They are two very different technologies.

How can the Government assist in that regard?  I am enthusiastic about the proposal to use the Mount Lucas site for solar energy generation.  If the solar panels prove successful, will Bord na M&oacute;na be more interested in developing solar capacity than wind turbines on its lands?  What can the Government do to encourage solar generation?  As far as I am concerned, the mix has gone too far towards wind.  With regard to the Mount Lucas project, what percentage of the turbines are not in use because other sources of energy are available on the grid?  Will the witnesses identify the locations of proposed wind farms over the next seven years?  I am concerned about a proposal for large-scale development close to a large property owned by Bord na M&oacute;na.  In the event of a connection being made to the grid, is it likely that the company will take advantage of the connection?  Is the area to which I refer being considered for a wind farm?<\/p><p> I asked earlier about the change in tariff from wind to biodigesters but I got an non-committal answer.  We should increase the tariffs for biodigesters but rather than levy the citizens of this State, perhaps we should reduce the tariff on other sources of energy generated from renewables.<\/p><p> The witnesses referred to Drehid, which is in the heart of my constituency.  I acknowledge that a community levy is imposed on each tonne going into the site but how many groups are involved and is there engagement with the local community in terms of showing people around the facility?  That is a better type of community interaction than simply paying a levy to the local authority for redistribution to the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#N01800","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Perhaps we can allow the witnesses to answer Deputy Lawlor's questions now before the Deputy asks further questions, if that is agreeable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#O00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will have a few more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#O00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>It is more economical for us to use domestically produced biomass than to import materials.  We have given a commitment under NewERA that for every tonne of domestically produced biomass we will displace an imported tonne.  Biomass has become an internationally traded commodity which means that ownership of an international biomass supply chain is a low-risk venture because if we do not consume the material in Ireland, we can sell it on the open market.  A considerable number of economies are converting to biomass power stations and combined heat and power plants for district heating and other purposes.<\/p> <p>  The most recent energy crop programme involved miscanthus but it was a disaster.  Farmers have long memories of it.  We have been trying to get the willow programme off the ground for nearly five years but the fruit of our efforts is 650 acres, which is very disappointing.  The other problem is that while willow needs to be grown on good land, there is a lack of willingness on the part of the farming community to lock up land for 15 to 20 years.  We can, however, offer 15 to 20-year contracts for the willow because the power stations will need biomass over that period.  I hope that will go some way towards encouraging cultivation.  We have also been working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to prepare a grant package.  When one plants willow, there is no cashflow for the first three years but the crop can be harvested every second year after that.  We are working to alleviate that cashflow problem upfront in order that farmers get an annual income from the first year for the crop.<\/p><p>That has been a major impediment in our experience.  The proposal is in with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the moment.  I gather the Department is very supportive of it and we hope to submit it to the Department of Finance for inclusion in this year's budget.  That is one way in which the Government could help us to establish the willow industry.  It is wide-ranging.  We need 15,000 ha within 100 km of the power stations.  That is the position in terms of biomass support.<\/p><p> There is grant support for the private forestry sector already.  The problem with the private forestry sector at the moment is that it tends to be rather fragmented.  The grant was for 7 ha blocks.  When we met representatives from the UK-based company with which we work in this area we concluded that the minimum economically-feasible land area to harvest private forestry was approximately 20 ha.  Therefore, we have to come up with a way of putting small co-operatives together to take close proximity 7 ha blocks and harvest them in one deployment.  Some of the barriers include road access etc.  There is some grant support available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but that will be one of the challenges.  There are over 19,000 private owners of forestry in Ireland.  It is incredibly fragmented.  How we achieve scale to harvest private forestry is going to be a key challenge.<\/p><p> A question was asked about wind versus solar.  Bord na M&oacute;na has the opportunity to roll out large-scale solar panels.  I am unsure whether committee members have seen these panels.  They are 2.5 m off the ground at the front and have a maximum height of 4 m at the back.  They are relatively maintenance-free once we deploy them.  They have halved in cost since 2008.  We are talking about efficiencies of 11% or 12%.  They are becoming very economical for western Europe.  Next year's pilot will tell us a great deal about how effective those farms will be.  We will be the first company in Ireland to deploy a solar farm on that scale.  We have to work out how we are going to co-locate that with the wind farm and how that works from a grid perspective.  That is a key point.  This time next year we will know a great deal more about solar.<\/p><p> Would we opt for solar instead of wind?  That is not our strategy at the moment.  Our plan is to co-locate the solar farms with the wind farms.  This has been a proven deployment option in Europe and we intend to do the same here.  I do not have the figures on curtailment at the moment, but that is something I can come back to the committee on.<\/p><p> A question was asked about wind farm locations but I cannot give specifics on the matter.  We have identified approximately 20 locations.  I cannot tell the committee about them because we are in the process of looking at the land banks of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte as part of the joint venture announced last year.  There are approximately 30 potential sites between the two companies.  Whichever location we decide on, it is our intention by the end of this year to communicate the decision to the local community within the coming six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>There was a question on community engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#P00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Internally, we have made a decision to the effect that before we submit any planning permission we will involve the local community.

Most of the projects in the private sector that are failing to get financing are not getting it because they cannot guarantee the fuel stock.

The reason they are so desirable or suitable for designation is because of the work we have carried out in the past in relation to restoration and rehabilitation and we are very happy to be in a situation where those lands can be designated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Senator Mullins's questions remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I will try to reply to the matters raised in sequence, if I may.

This is the first year we have received anything from Coillte.  Some 50,000 tonnes will be wood and 5,000 tonnes will be brash.  The brash is made up of the first and second thinnings of the tree.  We have tried using stumps in the past because obviously we have a lot of wood on our own land.  The problem is that there is lots of soil and stones, etc., in the wood and up to now we have not been able to find a machine that is capable of crushing and chipping it as the wood is very hard.  We had a demonstration last week from a German company which now appears to have a machine that is capable of chipping it.  If that is successful, our intent would be to maximise the biomass out-take which would include the stumps and the roots, but that is a relatively recent development in terms of capability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Quinn know what percentage of the Coillte output it is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T00400","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>It is none at the moment because we do nothing with -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Bord na M&oacute;na does nothing with Coillte?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T00600","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Yes.

If I may move on to the international biomass supply chain, there are two types of international biomass with which we are engaged at the moment.  We import palm kernel shells which are used in the palm oil industry.  They are coming in from Indonesia and Malaysia.  We can call the second biomass woody biomass.  We look to the USA, South America and Africa for that.  There is a power company in the UK called Drax which has converted 50% of its capacity to biomass.  Its model is that it went to the southern United States, took rights on the forestry for 20 years and built a wood pellet plant and shipping terminal and it now brings 900,000 tonnes of pellets back to the UK annually.  It constructed two 450,000 tonne plants.<\/p><p>That is potentially one model that we may look at.  I mentioned sourcing.  There will be three streams: owned infrastructure, internationally sourced contracts on long-term agreements for ten or 15 years and domestic supply.  I also mentioned that the risk of developing an international supply chain is pretty low because one can sell it on the open market.  It is a commodity-based fuel stock.<\/p><p> In regard to future modules with Coillte, we have only one which we are working on, that is, the wind farms.  The State proposes to have one company developing wind farms.  We are taking our development pipleline and Coillte's development pipeline and currently evaluating whether we can merge the two and have one company to develop wind farms.  We are not engaged with Coillte on any of the other projects, for example, anaerobic digestion, gasification or landfill gas.<\/p><p> I was asked about the number of employees.  We have 500 to 600 seasonal employees depending on how late we start the harvest.  Obviously, the later the harvest, the more people we need to try to catch up.  It is our intention to keep the 2,200 FTEs long-term but the mix will change.  There will probably be more seasonal employees than permanent employees.  The overall FTEs will be the 2,200.<\/p><p> In respect of the &euro;24.2 million, due to the reduction in volume we get almost &euro;17 million or &euro;18 million from sales.  Some &euro;8.7 million will come out of labour cost.  The reason we need &euro;8.7 million for labour costs is that 62% of the cost of producing peat is labour related, 38% is non-labour.  As there is not enough in the 38% to achieve the &euro;24.2 million, unfortunately we have to do something with the labour costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>They are the issues that are currently with the LRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#U00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I will not go into the specifics on that for obvious reasons.

I am aware from the presentation that Bord na M&oacute;na has a joint venture with the Cluddaun project.  It seems Bord na M&oacute;na, Coillte and ESB are running around the country almost trying to outbid each other to build various wind farms.  That is driving the planning process at which Bord na M&oacute;na is frustrated.  Will the joint venture have a responsibility to communities on the part of the three semi-State companies in this space or just carry on as at present?<\/p> <p>  In respect jof the Northern Ireland issue, have the representatives engaged with customs, the Department of Finance and the Garda?  Is Bord na M&oacute;na losing money each year?  I am aware that many of its loyal suppliers are feeling the heat and are looking to Bord na M&oacute;na, as the parent company, to take leadership.  Have the representatives engaged with Revenue on that issue?<\/p> <p>  If Bord na M&oacute;na wants to get into biomass, how is it that we had an announcement in Mayo at the weekend that a company is going to import biomass for five or six years?  Bord na M&oacute;na is one of the largest landowners in County Mayo, literally within miles of where the plant will be based.  If Bord na M&oacute;na sees a future for itself as the biomass base, it makes no sense when this golden opportunity was presented to it that nobody in the company took the ball and ran with it.   <\/p> <p>  I apologise on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, who had to attend a family event this afternoon.

With regard to the Coillte wind development project in County Mayo, the Cluddaun project, the reasons it was rejected from a planning standpoint are not directly applicable to our site.  There were different issues specific to that site.  Our site is absolutely adjacent.  Any site we own we develop in joint venture with ESB.<\/p><p>We have had delays also and are currently suffering from a continuing delay in achieving a revised planning.  There have been some legal developments.  A law case decision at the latter part of last year in the O'Grianna case has had a bearing on this.  We are still absolutely committed to developing that project and working hand in hand with the ESB we expect to deliver.<\/p><p> On the subject of community gain, we actively engage with the local community in terms of maintaining relationships and explaining what we are doing and the nature of the project.  We have had a series of town hall meetings.  I think a fundamental aspect of Bord na M&oacute;na's DNA is its responsibility to the community.  We in Bord na M&oacute;na regard ourselves as being part of and a product of the local community, especially in the midlands.  Generations of the same families have worked for the company.  We actively engage in local communities, in particular on infrastructure projects.  We believe it is essential to liaise actively with the communities and to bring them on the journey with us.<\/p><p> In response to the question on carbon tax and the engagement of Bord na M&oacute;na with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, we have actively engaged with both.  A couple of years ago, prior to the introduction of the carbon tax, members may remember that the then Minister for Finance deferred its introduction for a couple of years pending the introduction of a so-called robust mechanism for dealing with the issue of product coming from across  the Border.  We engaged heavily with the Revenue in relation to that.  The reality is that there is no robust mechanism that works in practice.  That is not, however, for the lack of engagement on our side.<\/p><p> The question of biomass and the announcement on Mayo Renewable Power was raised.  We have land adjacent to that project, but what has been demonstrated based on extensive trials over the years is that Bord na M&oacute;na's land does not support the growing of biomass.

Some of that land is used to provide amenity and tourism facilities for local communities.  An outstanding example, which the Chairman will be familiar with, is the Lough Boora Discovery Park in County Offaly.  It is an extensive area that is comprised of 3,000 acres of restored peatland.  It provides a huge tourism amenity in that part of County Offaly and in the midlands in general.  In the past year we constructed a visitor facility at the site.  Recently, the Irish tourism industry awarded the site the title of the best environmental initiative in the tourism industry in the past year.  We are very pleased with the award.  It is a tremendous site which attracts between 60,000 and 70,000 visitors per year, half of whom were from overseas and half of whom were from Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In addition, we have a number of other projects around the country.  Another example is a 400 acre site in Abbeyleix, County Laois.  Together with the local community, we have developed it into a tourism and amenity site.  If members are down in that direction, it is located on the old Cork Road and is south of Abbeyleix.  The local community has also constructed a walkway at the site in recent times.  There are a number of instances of that type of activity across our land bank and sites and across the country.  Even at facilities, such as the Mount Lucas wind farm, we have constructed a wetland and tourism facility.  It includes walks or walkways and a visitor centre will be constructed at the location later in the year.<\/p> <p>  I can assure the Deputy that we are very interested in tourism and in exploiting the potential of our lands for eco-tourism and other types of tourism activity.

It has been convened for the purpose of the consideration by the Select Sub-Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015.  The Bill was referred to this committee on 25 March 2015.  I am proposing that the sub-committee will consider the Bill from now until 7.15 p.m., if necessary.  If the proceedings on the Bill are not concluded by 7.15 p.m., we will suspend for 30 minutes and resume at 7.45 p.m.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  This Bill provides for plans by Government relating to climate change; the establishment of a body to be known as the National Expert Advisory Council on Climate Change; and provides for matters connected therewith.  The Bill contains 16 sections and there are 52 amendments proposed.  I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and officials from his Department, Mr. David Walker and Mr. John O'Neill.  I must remind the officials that they cannot speak at this meeting.  The grouping listing has been circulated.  Is the listing agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I will now deal with the amendments which were deemed to be out of order by the Bills Office by reading into the record the note I have received from the Bills Office regarding same.  The Bill as currently drafted does not set out any quantitative emission target reductions.  The setting of specific national mitigation targets, that is, actions aimed at reducing emissions and the implementing measures required to reach those targets, for example, energy efficiency or renewable energy policy measures and so forth, would impose financial costs on the Exchequer.  Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputies Stanley and Catherine Murphy proposes inserting a new definition of low carbon into the Bill to provide for an aggregate reduction of at least 80% compared with 1990 figures.  The amendment could involve a potential charge on the Exchequer and must therefore be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 156 (3).  Amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Catherine Murphy proposes deleting section 3 of the Bill in its entirety and replacing it with an alternative section entitled \"Emissions Reduction Targets\".  This new section proposes setting mitigation targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 2050, interim targets for 2030 and annual targets.  This proposed new section also requires the Minister to ensure the net emissions account for the year 2050 are at least 80% lower than the baseline and that the net emissions account for the year 2020 are at least 42% lower than the baseline.  The amendment could involve a potential charge on the Exchequer and must, therefore, be ruled out of order in accordance with standing order 156 (3).  A number of other amendments in the name of Deputies Stanley, Catherine Murphy and Cowen have also been ruled out of order for the same reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#B00100","speaker":"996"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":252,"content":"<p>The reason behind the rulings is the very same.

Few, if any of us, doubt the validity of the concept of climate justice which considers the impact of climate change on those who have made the smallest contribution to the problem.  Such persons also have the most limited means to address the issue when they are affected.  Collectively we all accept this and I am no different.  Climate change exacerbates many problems, not only in developing countries but in all countries, and the aim must be to provide for practical actions.<\/p> <p>  By far the single most important contribution any country can make is to take ambitious action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions as part of the global effort to limit climate change and its impact.  That is what the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill is all about.  It is about putting in place an institutional framework to ensure robust mitigation policy measures will be developed and in a timely fashion.  Ireland, through the European Union, is active in the international negotiations that aim to deliver this December a legally binding global agreement on combating climate change.  We will play a very active role in that regard.  The Bill already recognises the importance of these international discussions in having regard to our obligations.  Ireland has maintained significant support, reporting climate finance of &euro;34 million in 2013, mostly for adaptation projects in Ireland's key partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa in particular.  Work is continuing to explore options on how to maintain and enhance such support into the future.<\/p> <p>  From the point of view of principle, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.

The concern is that this Bill is long on tokenistic aspiration and very short on concrete measures and targets that are binding and that will force real action for dealing with climate change.  That is the point and nothing I have heard from the Government side in the debate on Second Stage or to date adequately explains why the Department will not buy into targets.

It does not take account of the legally binding mitigation targets that are being set by the EU to which we are bound as part of the international process.  There can only be two outcomes.  Either domestic mitigation targets are lower than those set by the EU, in which case they would be redundant, or they are higher than those set by the EU, in which case they would be seeking decarbonisation not least as a cost to the national economy and thereby endangering our economic recovery and putting us at an economic disadvantage compared to the rest of the EU.<\/p><p> Those are the two options.  We might bear this in mind when we come back on Report Stage and look at this again.  I should also add that the report of the joint committee on the outline heads of the Bill did not establish domestic mitigation targets separate to those decided upon as part of successive EU effort sharing decisions.  We will come back to this on Report Stage and I will look at it again.  In this context, I ask that the amendments be withdrawn.

However, I do not accept the choice that he is giving us or at least I do not think the stark choice he is giving us is the right way to look at this, particularly if we talk about exceeding targets, saying it could damage our economic recovery.  It sees the argument put forward by people concerned about climate change, namely, the need for serious, binding and effective targets; a proper system of reporting on the meeting of those targets; ensuring that there is a strategy to achieve targets and real accountability in that area; and overshooting the targets that might be set by the EU as a threat to the economy.  It is quite the opposite.  If we do not address climate change, the threat not just to our economy but our society will be far greater in the medium to longer term so I do not think we should pose it in those terms.  We need to break from that mindset.  Even now, one could argue that flooding and the impact of climate change are already having a huge cost for the economy, the Exchequer and indeed for agriculture.<\/p><p>Often we imagine we are defending agriculture against environmentalists when, in fact, that is the wrong way to look at it.  If we do not address this issue, everyone in the entire economy will pay, including those involved in the farming sector.  The logic behind the amendments is that we should be leaders in this area and should not engage in special pleading on behalf of particular sectors.  We should not engage in special pleading with the European Union to duck out of targets in certain areas and argue that Ireland is a special case.  We should be leaders in this regard because there is no more urgent and serious matter than runaway climate change and the need to address it.  That is the logic behind the amendments.

In setting targets we could make significant advances in the State and semi-State sectors, including schools, hospitals and other high energy users.  We could, for example, set a target that within two years every school, hospital, local authority and so forth should develop and publish its plans to reduce its energy use.  That would demonstrate that we were serious about tackling climate change by drilling down into local communities.  Several years ago a climate action committee was set up by the local authorities in counties Limerick and Clare.  It developed a strategy and drew up plans to deal with climate change.  The Department could issue instructions to all local authorities to revert to it by the end of the year with their plans for the transport and other sectors.  We need to look at the transport sector, including private cars, heavy goods vehicles and so forth.  What could be done in that sector to alleviate the effects of climate change?<\/p> <p>  The Government must lead a very ambitious programme for the commercial and semi-State sectors to enable them to work together, put protocols in place and review progress annually or bi-annually.  That would make a lot of sense.  That is how to tackle climate change.  Does the Minister have a view on this?  I know that the heating system in the Houses of the Oireachtas, for example, was totally changed and is now run on bio energy sources.  That is a fantastic development about which not many people actually know.  Will the Minister ask the local authorities to draw up plans, in conjunction with the experts in voluntary bodies and so forth?  We need to develop plans and targets that we can meet and which will stand up to scrutiny.  In that way, we will show that we are really serious about tackling climate change.  <\/p> <p>  To refer to a hugely controversial planning issue, I am very disappointed that so many people in Ireland are opposed to the development of wind energy projects.

There is a gap between legislation and what people think.  While the law and the obligations we have are black and white, people believe changes should be made and we, as legislators, must cross over to the way they think.  We must initiate, through them and the targets we are discussing here, probably initially by way of voluntary measures with communities.  We must all step up to the mark and try to bridge the gap.  Local authorities have excellent conferences around the country.  I do not know if there is a local authority conference on climate change or plans for climate change.  We could tell every local authority that by 1 September we want it to have held a meeting and put forward proposals on climate change, how each council is going to change how it uses energy, how it organises transport and how it is going to show leadership in the community by going out and encouraging change.<\/p> <p>  While I am not up to speed on this and the Minister or his Department would know more about it, there were climate change officers in some county councils whose job it was to deal with climate change and proactively, outside the black and white of legislation and planning, to push the agenda forward.  Schools are a very important resource, particularly students in transition year.  Perhaps we should hold a competition, which the Department might support, to find the best school in the country for climate change.  Schools would outline how they are going to change their energy use in school and influence their parents at home.  Education and information is a major issue and there is a major gap on which we must follow through, namely, how organisations such as An Taisce inform schools on green schools and how they change.  The concept of water is very topical and controversial.  We could do much more to bridge the gap.<\/p> <p>  We could do an inventory of the high energy users in each county.  Counties Clare and Limerick have worked together.  Tipperary and another county - perhaps Kilkenny or Waterford, I am not sure - did that and had a plan which was signed off by the local authorities and the council staff.  It was a plan to alleviate climate change in their communities but going bigger than the county and involving big energy users, for example in a city such as Limerick.  I am throwing out ideas in terms of strategies the Department could use to bring about the change or meet the targets, which, in many respects, is the objective of the proposal we are discussing.

Is there no mechanism by which the spokespersons could meet the Minister and his staff to work through these matters?  I do not believe that because something is complex, we should skirt around it.  We should address such issues and use the best information all of the spokespersons have to try to come up with a solution.

Obviously, we have our national climate change policy which commits us to having an 80% decarbonised economy by 2050 and carbon neutrality in agriculture.  We also have our 2020 targets for greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore, we do have targets.  I have said what I have said about the targets being set through the European Union and will not repeat our two options.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's comments on not threatening the economy and the issue of balancing economic and environmental considerations, I agree with him in principle in respect of future generations.  However, we have to make sustainable decisions - decisions that ensure we strike the right balance between these two competing factors.  They do not always have to be competing.  A low carbon environment could be a significant economic driver.  It just depends on getting the balance right, but, in principle, I do not disagree with the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the comments of Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, there are preparations ongoing for the national mitigation plan.  I take on board all of the comments the Deputy made on schools, hospitals, etc.  He is correct that the work needs to continue and what we are doing will be part of it.  <\/p> <p>  I will be launching a public consultation process very soon, in a matter of days.  It will open up this discussion to everyone, which is necessary.  It needs to be transparent and open, as nobody here has a monopoly of ideas.  Those who come together and engage in some engineering could actually achieve great things.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Fergus O'Dowd and Richard Boyd Barrett raised the issue of local authorities.<\/p><p>On Report Stage I intend to do something about them and their role.  I was going to refer to this later, but since it has just come up in the debate, I will make reference to it now.  I intend to enhance the role of local authorities in this important area.  Therefore, I intend to introduce amendments on Report Stage.  I have been considering them based on the remarks made on Second Stage by a number of Deputies, including the two opposite.  Members should please bear in mind that I am taking on board the comments made.<\/p><p> Deputy Fergus O'Dowd is correct that a number of local authorities have been very proactive in this area.  Some have been more proactive than others, as is always the case.  I have seen considerable work being done in some local authorities in preparing for this.  The local authority in County Tipperary, for instance, engaged in a process of installing solar panels on all of its buildings.  This has reaped great dividends and resulted in savings.  I must draw attention also to the lead the local authority has given in this area.  There are other examples in other local authority areas.  I appreciate the comments made on this issue.<\/p><p> The Deputy made reference to wind energy.  To be honest, I have been frustrated in this regard.  It is a question of getting the mix right.  I have been frustrated at the fact that other avenues have not been considered as part of the mix.  The lead time that was necessary in which to provide for these avenues may not have been used.  I am trying to prepare the groundwork for these avenues in other areas and they will bear fruit in the future.<\/p><p> Those are my replies to the individual comments made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#P00900","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The Minister did not respond to the direct question I asked him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#Q00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Deputy.

I came in a little late because I was in the D&aacute;il.  The point I really want to make is that while we can all make very positive noises about the need to do something about this matter, we return to drift again.  That is the fear.  We do not have the luxury of returning to drift.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of elements to be considered.  When considering the next amendment, we will discuss the time allowed for the mitigation report and the procedures for reporting back.  On the specific matter of targets, if we do not have them, there will be nothing to discipline us to prevent drift.<\/p><p>Even with the best will in the world it will drift.  If we are to get into the type of discussions mentioned by Deputy Fergus O'Dowd where we have to get down to the detail, rather than drift along in the hope that something is happening but really nothing is happening, there has to be a much tighter disciplinary framework which forces us at local authority and sectoral levels in terms of the timetable and the numbers to be achieved to do that.  Then all the rest will follow - engaging with school students, forcing us to think about it at local authority level, forcing people in particular sectors of the economy to look at the detail as to whether every new house is built with solar panels.  Are we going to look at local community energy co-operatives which utilise a mix of different renewable energies where there is a real focus and say that people have got to deliver?<\/p><p> Let us have the discussion about wind and the different mix.  I am sceptical about the industrial wind but let us have the discussion.  Targets will force us to deliver; however, we do it, we have got to deliver.  How many houses in one's area have been insulated in the past year?  How many houses needing insulation across the country have been insulated?  Without targets I do not see how this will happen, we will drift along with aspiration but little to tie us, or to say whether we have achieved anything.  If there is not a target against which to match something, people can trot out numbers to say they achieved such and such in the past year.  If there is not a target against which to test it, what does that really mean against what we have to achieve?  The point about targets is that they force that discipline on us, from which the rest will follow.  That is the argument.  The rationale and the logic for it are simply irresistible if we are serious about delivering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#Q01600","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I do not have much to add except to say that I agree with the principle enunciated by the Deputy.  However, we have very defined targets from a European process.  I ask the Deputy to trust me on this issue.  The European Union will push us to ensure we meet our targets.  We are not far off achieving those targets.  They are not that far away.  I will be launching a consultation process on the mitigation plans in the near future in which everyone will be able to play their part.  We will get down to the level of detail required.  Those are the areas which excite me.<\/p> <p>  In my wider role in the Department I derive much energy and enthusiasm from the volume of new technologies which come from every corner of the country to deal with this issue.  I see more technologies every week.  When we get into the mitigation plans and the encouragement of the technologies and, dare I say, from an economic point of view as regards creating value and wealth, the export of those technologies to China, which I visited a couple of months ago, and other countries which need them.  At least they can help improve the concept in our own country.  That is the nitty gritty I want to get down to.  However, we need to pass the Bill.  Whatever one says about this Government, Ireland is one of the first countries to pass a Bill such as this, though it may not meet everyone's desires, targets or terminology.  To be honest, there is probably no right or wrong answer to some of the questions on levels and variants but we need a starting point.  The starting point is that we must pass this legislation.  We have targets based on the European Union.  They are difficult targets.   As a country, given our profile and our background they are very difficult targets.<\/p><p>Given our rural and agricultural profile, there would be significant challenges.  From the baseline of where we have come from an economic perspective, it would bring even further challenges.  Before this job, I worked with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The capacity to make changes in transport, which is a very capital-intensive area, was very limited.  I did as much as I could with sustainable transport, for example, with bikes, the Leap card and public transport changes.  Having said that, it would not be fair to say we do not have targets.  We are in a system, through the European Union, and that is the system we must stick to.  We will be doing very well to meet them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#R00200","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Advice before setting annual targets<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>6. <\/b>(1) The Minister shall, before laying a draft of a statutory instrument containing an order under <i>section 5(1)* <\/i>before the Government, request advice from the relevant body.<br \/><br \/>(2) The request for shall must include requests for the relevant body&rsquo;s views&mdash;<blockquote>(a) in the case of annual targets proposed for years in the period 2015-2020, as to whether those targets are consistent with a reduction over that period of net emissions accounts which would allow the interim target and the 2050 target to be met,<br \/><br \/>(b) in the case of annual targets proposed for years in the period 2021-2050, as to whether those targets are consistent with a reduction over that period of net emissions accounts which would allow the 2050 target to be met,<br \/><br \/>(c) in any case&mdash;<blockquote>(i) as to what annual targets are appropriate by reference to the target-setting criteria,<br \/><br \/>(ii) as to the extent to which the annual targets should be met by taking action to reduce net emissions,<br \/><br \/>(iii) as to the respective contributions towards meeting the annual targets and the domestic effort target that should be made&mdash;<blockquote>(I) by the traded sector of the economy,<br \/><br \/>(II) by the other sectors of the economy,<\/blockquote>(iv) as to the respective contributions towards meeting the annual targets and the domestic effort target that should be made by&mdash;<blockquote>(I) energy efficiency,<br \/><br \/>(II) energy generation,<br \/><br \/>(III) land use,<br \/><br \/>(IV) transport.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>(3) The Minister shall publish the advice requested under <i>subsection (1) <\/i>as soon as reasonably practicable after they receive it.<br \/><br \/>(4) As soon as reasonably practicable after laying such a draft, the Minister shall publish a statement setting out in respect of the annual targets set by the order&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the reasons for setting those annual targets at those levels,<br \/><br \/>(b) the extent to which those targets take account of the target-setting criteria.<\/blockquote>(5) If the order under <i>section 5(1)* <\/i>makes provision different from that recommended by the relevant body, the Minister shall publish a statement setting out the reasons why.<br \/><br \/>(6) Advice requested under <i>subsection (1) <\/i>or a statement under <i>subsection (4) <\/i>or <i>(5) <\/i>may be published in such manner as the Minister considers appropriate.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#S00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":351,"content":"<p>SECTION 4<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 12:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 6, line 9, to delete &quot;24 months&quot; and substitute &quot;6 months&quot;.<\/blockquote>This is pretty straightforward and the reason for the amendment is clear.

This debate on the budget is the most important debate we have.  We have a long run-in to the budget, with many submissions and extended debate.  For the best part of several weeks, the country is focused on the fine detail of the budget and how it affects different sectors of society.  We have this because, \"It's the economy, stupid\".  Even people who do not think about politics or what goes on here most of the time focus on this debate because they know it will impact on them.  If we are serious about climate action and meeting targets, we must put that issue into a similar space.  That culture change is necessary if we are to deal with the issue.<\/p><p> I share the Minister's view, as I suspect many others interested in this issue and environmental groups do, that if we make this space, it could prove exciting, because it would allow us and the people to think about all the exciting changes, technology and changes in practices that could be beneficial, not just at the environmental level, but at an economic and social level also.

The plan should become a big event and be interrogated in a public way.  The arguments around the plan and different views on how best to put the plan together should be discussed and then the decision should be made on the plan.

Obviously I disagree with the Deputy's proposal on the basis that the national mitigation plan is designed, pursuant to section 4(2)(c), and already takes into account any existing obligations on the State under EU and national laws.  Accordingly, each successive national mitigation plan must abide by our legally binding mitigation obligations.  Specifying projected national emissions, after each successive plan has been implemented, would be redundant.  Moreover, the Bill, as currently drafted, does not deal with specific national emission levels so introducing the element here would be out of place.  That is just a practical issue.<\/p> <p>   We have been around the Houses in terms of debating this issue.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, every country is different.  We must look at our own profiling.  We have very strict targets under the Europe 2020 goals.  We have set ourselves very strict targets in our policy statement for 2050 as well.  We would be foolish if we were not to respect the profiling of our economy and the direction in which it is going in how we deal with the issue.  The Deputy hinted to a sector but he did not refer to it, namely, agriculture.  When one takes into account the deregulation of the milk industry and where we are going as a country, of course we must take advantage of that in terms of our capacity in the production of baby powder and other dairy products.  I make no apologies for that.  Without a doubt we are the best in the world at it.  We need to leverage the potential.  I would be surprised if anyone disagreed with me.<\/p><p> I do not believe any sector will be let off.  Agriculture will face significant challenges.  There will be no special case.  We will argue for the best fit for our profiling, as we have always done, and as we do in every other case.  In many respects agriculture has already faced and met serious challenges.  I reject the idea that we would put in changes and get each sector to individually stick to targets in the process that has been outlined.  We must stick to the targets set out in the European process, which are very difficult.  I do not believe in penalising a sector, for instance, agriculture, which in the specific area I mentioned is very sound environmentally.  It is not just this Government or on this side of the country that we have made the sound arguments outlined.  It could be the case that the way the profiling of this country has been done has not been correct.  We need to argue for that and ensure we get the best outcome.

Agriculture is an expanding part of our economy and if it can add greatly to our wealth by selling the best product across the world, why would we not encourage developments in the sector?<\/p><p>Hand in hand with these developments, we must examine issues related to developments in assessing the potential for transforming agricultural waste into energy.  Some time ago I visited a farm in County Limerick on which a waste to energy system was used very efficiently.  It was able to supply a significant amount of energy to the national grid.  We need to encourage all such approaches and also to consider the potential in industry to transform waste into energy.  If we did not have a recession - none of us wanted one - we would be even further from meeting our climate change targets than we are.  As the economy improves we have a considerable opportunity and challenge to ensure future developments will be carbon neutral in so far as is possible.<\/p><p> In my area there is a cement factory which has a significant waste to energy policy in place.  The company has changed its fuel source.  It is far more productive and intelligent for us to think in that way.  From speaking to industrialists who are creating employment, they are very much in agreement with such an approach.  They want to be part of a better world and bring about a reduction in CO2 emissions.  The more modern and bigger they are, the more they want to do it.  One of the problems with energy production in this country and elsewhere in Europe is that it is becoming so expensive that high energy users that have been responsible for high CO2 emissions in the past and remain in that category are moving out of Europe because they can no longer compete.  Owing to energy costs their products are far too expensive and this has given rise to a major crisis.  If we are serious about the issue, we must change the way we think about the energy we use, from where we can get it, including wind energy, which is a huge plus if one looks at it in the right way.  If the research continues into wave and tidal energy, we could potentially have a bonus in terms of new energy sources that will never run out.  If we change the way we think, we will do much better.  I agree with what the Minister said, but we must consider the challenges that are met regularly and interrogated frequently.  The Minister said no Minister would get off the hook in respect of meeting the targets set.<\/p><p> My final point is about transport and issues such as electric cars, walking, cycling and encouraging low carbon activities.  Nantes is one of the best places in the world in which to live.  It has focused on the provision of public transport and bicycles.  Using a car is not considered to be the way in which to travel.  Previously, there were eight lanes into the city, but that number has been reduced to two to make everyone use public transport.  I do not know, however, whether everyone would agree with me on that point.  However, they are the challenges we must meet and we must wake up to them.  While the legislation is not and never could be perfect, it is an improvement on what we have in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#Y00800","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>We will not save agriculture or any other industry by having targets.

Section 4 indicates that the national mitigation plan shall \"specify the policy measures that, in the opinion of the Government, would be required in order to manage greenhouse gas emissions and the removal of greenhouse gas at a level that is appropriate for furthering the achievement of the national transition objective\".

We have made these mistakes before with disastrous consequences, for example, the property basket.  It is a mistake to set off the absolute imperative to transform the economy to deal with climate change against the defence of a singular view of agricultural interest and Irish agriculture.

In the debate on the content and component elements of the plan Members will put forward different perspectives, so it makes sense that prior to the adoption of a plan it would be debated in both Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#DD00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Section 4 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are physical alternatives and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#DD00600","speaker":"996"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":450,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 8, after line 38, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Progress towards targets<\/b><b>5. <\/b>(1) The Minister shall in each year, beginning with the year 2016, request the relevant body to prepare a report setting out that body&rsquo;s views on&mdash;<blockquote>(a) progress towards achievement of&mdash;<blockquote>(i) annual targets,<br \/><br \/>(ii) the interim target,<br \/><br \/>(iii) the 2050 target,<\/blockquote>(b) whether the annual targets, the interim target or the 2050 target are likely to be achieved,<br \/><br \/>(c) any further effort which may be necessary to achieve annual targets, the interim target or the 2050 target.<\/blockquote>(2) No later than the end of the second year following a year for which an annual target has been set (a &ldquo;target year&rdquo;), the Minister shall request the relevant body to prepare a report setting out that body&rsquo;s views on&mdash;<blockquote>(a) whether the annual target for the target year was met,<br \/><br \/>(b) whether the domestic effort target was met in that target year,<br \/><br \/>(c) the ways in which those targets were or were not met,<br \/><br \/>(d) the action taken by the Minister to reduce net emissions during that year.<\/blockquote>(3) The Minister shall lay a response to the relevant body&rsquo;s report under this section before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as reasonably practicable after they receive that body&rsquo;s report.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>The same arguments apply to this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#DD00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":453,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 9, line 38, to delete &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015060900002#DD01000","speaker":"999"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Section 5 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Section 6 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1433862900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 7 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1433862900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Section 7 is opposed by Deputy Catherine Murphy.

It is not reasonable to expect it to do all of this work and turn around a major review of mitigation policy and its implementation in Ireland in just six months.  That is not possible.  We have had discussions at this committee on the range of issues involved which we could discuss forever.  It would be impossible to do it in a period of six months.  It is critical that there be a certain period of time to carry out the first review.

The report is entitled, She is not a criminal: The impact of Ireland&rsquo;s abortion law, and was launched this morning in Dublin.  I am joined by my two colleagues from our international secretariat.  They are Amnesty International's secretary general, Salil Shetty, and Amnesty International's senior legal adviser and the report author, Christina Zampas.  The reason for their appearance before the committee is that this is a global Amnesty International report.  Ireland is one of the focus countries for our global campaign, My Body My Rights, which highlights the control and criminalisation of sexuality and reproduction by many governments around the world.  This is actually the first time Ireland has been the focus of a global campaign.  Mr. Shetty will speak to the committee about that while Ms Zampas will then highlight some of the key findings and recommendations in the report.<br\/><br\/>As members are aware, this is the first time Amnesty International has appeared before this committee on the subject of abortion.  We noted the committee's lengthy and extensive hearings on the general scheme of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill in 2013.  However, as the ambit of that Bill was narrowly framed on a real and substantial risk to life ground for access to abortion, it fell far short of what international human rights law demands.  Of very particular concern is the fact that the new legislation continues to criminalise women and anyone who assists them, including health care providers, so we appreciate this committee was not in a position to debate what a human rights compliant abortion framework would involve and how that could be effected here.<br\/><br\/>Since that Bill was debated and passed, we have all watched Ms Y's tragic story unfold and the High Court PP <i>v<\/i>. HSE case cause shockwaves.  Both exposed the frightening consequences of the narrow, confused and complicated legal abortion framework that emerged from that Bill.  However, as our report shows, there are quieter and more hidden human rights violations playing out daily in the lives of women and girls here in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In the aftermath of the historic &quot;Yes&quot; vote on Ireland&rsquo;s marriage equality referendum last month, members will have heard the renewed pleas by civil society for the repeal of Article 40.3.3 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to finally be put to the people here.  Having looked carefully at Irish law and its consequences, repeal of the eighth amendment is one of Amnesty International's report's central recommendations.<br\/><br\/>Today our key message and appeal to this committee is that it adds to its work programme a review of this issue.  As our report shows, Ireland is not just an outlier in Europe and the rest of the world in legal terms &ndash; it is denying its women and girls their fundamental human rights and causing them untold harm.  This is an urgent and grave human rights issue, one which is now galvanising our members throughout the world.  This committee has the power to bring a fresh Oireachtas examination to this issue and place before this Government and the next one a mandate and roadmap for legislative and constitutional reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433866800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be afforded this opportunity to address the committee on the day we launch our report on Ireland's abortion laws.  Amnesty International is a global independent human rights movement.  We have no political or religious affiliations.  Amnesty's global My Body My Rights campaign works around the world to ensure that we all have the right to make decisions about our bodies and sexual and reproductive lives, which include the right to information and access to services.  We work on this in several countries, including Nepal, Burkina Faso, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, El Salvador and, now, here in Ireland.<\/p><p>We hope to contribute through this piece of research and this campaign to the entrenched, sensitive and often personal debate on abortion here with a clear human rights perspective and with thorough research into the impact of abortion laws on the human rights of women and girls.  Let me be clear.  In almost all cases, criminalising abortion and denying women and girls access to safe and legal abortion is a violation of a range of human rights, including the right to life, health, information and to be free from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.  In Ireland, the jails are not full of women and their doctors for having abortions and its maternal mortality rates are low.  However, this is partly the case because Ireland effectively outsources its human rights obligations to other countries.  <\/p><p> Ireland was chosen as a focus country well over a year ago for this campaign because it has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world and we believed it would be important to provide thorough analysis of the human rights consequences of the abortion laws and practices in Ireland after the extremely limited legal reform of 2013.  A further impetus for choosing Ireland was the death of Savita Halappanavar.  The circumstances of her death unveiled how dangerously uncertain the narrow risk to life ground required by the Constitution was.  It still shows today that if the law had provided for a risk to health ground, as required under international human rights law, Savita Halappanavar could be alive today.  <\/p><p> Ireland has a very good domestic human rights track record in many areas.  Regrettably, it is not so here.  I honestly hope that the Irish State does not look short-sightedly at the international interest in and attention to Ireland's marriage equality referendum vote.  The very idea of extending civil marriage to same-sex couples was an acutely sensitive, if not controversial, subject in Ireland just a few years ago and yet it managed to get cross-party support for this and 62% of the electorate voted for it.  Ireland became just the 20th state in the world to permit civil marriage equality.  Ireland has moved so far so quickly on marriage equality but it makes the treatment of women and girls in its Constitution, laws and practices all the more jarring.  The eyes of the world are on this Government and also on this Parliament.  This committee is the interface between the Government and the electorate at this critical juncture.  <\/p><p> The root of the human rights violations, pain, fear and trauma of the women and girls in this report is the 1983 amendment to the Constitution.  As the UN Human Rights Committee pointed out to Ireland in July 2014, the State's Constitution is no excuse for these human rights violations no matter what the public mood or vote is.  It must be heartening to the committee that in the case of abortion, polling has repeated shown that the Irish public is on the side of human rights.  Ireland is a noted champion of human rights and indeed on general equality on the international stage.  Amnesty International has worked with Ireland's UN missions in New York and Geneva for many years on women's rights.  The Government's review of its foreign policy, which was published in January 2015, reaffirmed its commitment to advancing gender equality and yet Ireland's domestic position on women's and girls' human rights related to abortion is deeply regressive and in violation of international human rights which it works abroad to protect.  This is also Ireland's final year on the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland is the co-facilitator of the UN negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda.  Is it not time to align its domestic law on women's rights with its global vision for the world's women and girls?  This committee can play a crucial role in this and should it take this issue on, Amnesty International stands ready to be of assistance to it.  <\/p><p> Our report is the result of research and interviews carried out by Amnesty International between September 2014 and April 2015 in Ireland and England.  It includes the testimonies of women, health care providers and civil society organisations.  We are indebted to all who contributed to the report.  It reviews the compliance of Irish law and policy on abortion with international human rights standards.  It finds both seriously wanting.<\/p><p> Ms Christina Zampas is the principal author.  She wrote the report, is our senior legal adviser at Amnesty International Ireland and is a noted legal expert in this field.  In that capacity, she has conducted research into the legal systems on abortion across the world, particularly in Europe, and she is best placed to speak on what she found in Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Salil Shetty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433866800,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank the members for inviting us today.  Across the many testimonies in this report from women, health care providers and civil society organisations about the impact of Ireland's restrictive abortion regime, there are significant recurrent themes that bear emphasising.  First, regardless of the law, women in Ireland have and will continue to have abortions.  The World Health Organization estimates confirm that restrictive abortion laws do not reduce the number of induced abortions as women will undergo abortions regardless of its legal status and lawful availability.  Ireland is no exception.  The eighth amendment and the 2013 abortion law have not stopped women from having abortions.  Every year, approximately 4,000 women travel to get abortions outside of Ireland.  Restricting access to safe and legal abortion in Ireland instead invariably leads to rights violations and disproportionately impacts those who are already marginalised or vulnerable, compounding the human rights violations they experience.<\/p> <p>  The story of Ms \"Y\" is a tragic example of how the legal regime in Ireland is harming women.  She was raped in her home country and as an asylum seeker, she sought a safe haven in Ireland or so she thought.  When she attempted to get an abortion here, she was unable to do so because of the ban on abortion even in cases of rape.  She tried to go to England but was turned back at the border because of her migrant status.  In protest at her inability to get an abortion, she stopped eating and drinking.  She was suicidal.  She was then entitled to an abortion on the only ground available under the law in Ireland, the life exception, but even so, she still could not get an abortion.  She was coerced into continuing the pregnancy despite her desperate pleas.  She underwent a caesarean section and her lawyer told us that the caesarean section scar is, and will continue to be, a constant reminder of the rape she endured in her country and the brutal treatment she received in Ireland.  Under human rights, such treatments can constitute torture.  <\/p> <p>  The second theme that arose was that without exception, every women Amnesty International spoke with, whether she travelled abroad for an abortion or remained in Ireland, experienced a violation of her right to physical and-or mental health.  In speaking of their choices to travel or to procure an illegal abortion in Ireland, almost every woman we spoke to made repeated reference to the death of Savita and the impact it had on them, some fearing for their lives should they need to undergo a lawful abortion in Ireland.  It is critical to note that the situation faced by Savita is not an isolated incident.  Any woman who is in the process of having a miscarriage could easily be her.  In fact, we spoke with several such women and I can speak to specific cases in our discussions following this presentation.  <\/p> <p>  The third theme that arose was that women consistently emphasised that having to travel abroad for an abortion made them feel like a criminal, regardless of the reason they were having abortions.  They all discussed the increased stigma and isolation this made them feel for making decisions that women in almost every other European country, with the exception of Malta, can make.  Women told us of their need to lie to their family, friends and employers; to arrange for child care; and to beg for money from friends in order to afford travel; and the fear they had of returning to Ireland with complications and needing health care but instead being labelled as a criminal.  As one doctor I spoke with said our Constitution is profoundly hypocritical and that it protects women to go abroad for something that is outlawed here.<\/p> <p>  The final theme that arose concerns the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995.  Most health care providers and counsellors we interviewed expressed frustration at this Act which essentially censors the provision of information on abortion and compromises the relationship between health care provider and patient.<\/p><p>The law&rsquo;s ban on advocating and promoting abortion has created a climate where women are denied full information on the abortion procedure in Ireland, and doctors could be held criminally liable for referring women to abortion providers.  This denies women their right to information and goes against all good practice, including that recommended by the World Health Organization. <br\/><br\/>One woman&rsquo;s statement embodies the sentiments of many interviewed for this report.  A woman identified in our report as Roisin told us:<blockquote>I&rsquo;m hoping [access to safe and legal abortion in Ireland] will happen in my lifetime.  So my daughter, when she is older and she needs to have an abortion, doesn&rsquo;t need to travel to the UK in secret, in [secret and in] silence.<\/blockquote>Amnesty International&rsquo;s calls are simple.  We know they will take courage on the part of legislators to see through.  However, as our report clearly shows, women's and girls&rsquo; health and lives are at stake and Ireland&rsquo;s human rights record is tarred.  This Legislature has a responsibility to ensure that the Republic&rsquo;s laws are in line with its international human rights obligations.  In order to achieve this, it is essential that the Constitution&rsquo;s eighth amendment be repealed; that abortion be decriminalised; that the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act be repealed and replaced with a legislative framework that ensures access to abortion both in law and in practice, at a minimum, in cases where the pregnancy poses a risk to the life or to the physical or mental health of a pregnant woman or girl, in cases of severe and fatal foetal impairment, and in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.  These are the requirements of Ireland's human rights obligations.  We are also calling for the repeal of the regulation of information legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for publishing the report.  I have read the summary, the recommendations and some of the conclusions and findings.  The individual testimonies certainly highlight some of the trauma people have to endure.  Mr. Gorman referred to a call by civil society to repeal the eighth amendment.  I cannot recall a time when we ever had a civil debate on this matter, to be quite truthful.  Perhaps from now on, we will try to ensure it is civil and cordial and that we will reach some consensus in addressing it.<\/p> <p>  This issue has been debated in the D&aacute;il on numerous occasions recently.  Deputy Daly introduced a Bill on a couple of occasions, as have other members.  There is no point in our trying to simplify this debate; it is quite complex and society has very strong views on it.  There is a deeply conservative element and those in this category have very strong objections to any form of liberalisation of abortion.  They talk about abortion on demand and the move towards that.  Theirs is certainly one view.  I have always said I believe there is a middle ground.  The matter of fatal foetal abnormalities is one on which there might be broader consensus.  Having said that, there is a strong body of opinion reflecting concern over this.<\/p> <p>  The eighth amendment is what anchors all the legislation and the interpretations by the Supreme Court in the context of the X case.  We have a very tangled legislative framework hanging off the eighth amendment.  The key question is alluded to in the recommendations.  The first recommendation is the repeal of Article 40.3.3&deg;.  To write this in black and white is quite easy but to reach a point where we could have a rational debate on it would require, in the first instance, a debate in the Parliament with a majority favouring the putting of the proposal to the people for debate.<\/p> <p>  The key question, which I cannot ask the witnesses to answer today, concerns whether the Irish people are ready to repeal the amendment without knowing what is to be put in its place.  Would they trust the Legislature to bring forward proposals?  The constitutional provision was made, in the first instance, in 1983 because the people were not of the view that they could trust that the move towards abortion on demand across Europe, the United States and elsewhere would not occur here.<\/p> <p>  There should be a debate on this issue.  We must confront it and we cannot deny the fact that ten to 12 Irishwomen will board a plane every day seeking an abortion for various reasons.  Irrespective of the reason, they feel they have a crisis pregnancy and that a termination is their option.  Very often, they travel under considerable pressure with a crisis pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  The report goes into some detail regarding the recommendations.  We received it only today so it certainly merits further discussion by this committee.<\/p> <p>  Let me return to the key issue, that of engaging civil society.  Mr. O'Gorman should be very clear that there are varying views in civil society.  There is a liberal civil society and a conservative one.  To have the debate will be exceptionally difficult.  There is no point in my pretending, in the face of a general election, that these issues cannot be very easily moved off the agenda for electoral reasons.  Unfortunately, that is what has happened regarding this issue for the past 30 years.  It has been avoided, to say the very least.<\/p> <p>  The tragic case of Savita Halappanavar brought the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act into being.  Many of the testimonies here regard the Savita Halappanavar case as an issue of concern.  Is what happened in Galway sometimes used to generate discourse without actually taking into account that it may not have been entirely a question of legislative problems and constitutional inhibitors?  If we are to structure an argument or debate, it should be grounded entirely on factual positions, both of those opposing the repeal of the eighth amendment and those proposing an amendment thereto.  The case of Savita Halappanavar was very tragic.  We had a long discussions in meetings of this committee on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill and there was a pre-legislative scrutiny element also.  This resulted in a variety of opinions.  It is not that every member agreed on how to move forward.  If we are to engage with broader society, we cannot deny the fact that 11 Irishwomen travel abroad for an abortion every day for many and various reasons.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have made recommendations.  How do they envisage our bringing about a discussion to address the recommendations in a debate, making reference to the equality referendum?  The key issue with that referendum was that there was broad political consensus.  I doubt this will feature in the case in question.  There is potential for a very divisive debate.  Perhaps the committee will have to examine this.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il previously.  We must try to come to some arrangement whereby we can actually have a proper debate, something like that which took place during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill.  Otherwise, this report will gather dust.  While it is gathering dust, another 12 women will go abroad every day of the week for a termination in England or Wales.  I assume this estimate is conservative in view of the fact that women also travel elsewhere for terminations.  One should not pretend it is easy to move this debate on because it is not.  Accepting that it is difficult would be the first step in trying to have a more inclusive debate representing all views in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#E00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Gorman and his two colleagues from Amnesty International to the committee.<\/p><p>I thank them for the contribution they have made and for the publication of the report, She is not a criminal: The impact of Ireland's abortion law, and confirm that is a view the party I represent has held throughout my political activism over many years.  It is the case that Irish opinion has evolved slowly on many matters, and most especially on the critical focus of the witnesses' address this evening, and is likely to take some little time still to get to a point where, I agree, we need to see the repeal of the eighth amendment.  Article 40.3.3&deg; denies the opportunity for women to make an effective choice where they are challenged by real and serious decision-making in their lives on their health, physical or mental well-being, the reality of the backdrop to their pregnancy, such as rape or incest, and where fatal foetal abnormalities have been confirmed and are clearly present.  In all of these situations the woman most certainly should have the right to decide in full consultation with trusted medical advisers and support.  This is not the case, and despite the good intentions of many regarding the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, it proved to be deficient when particular cases have presented in the period since.<\/p><p> I mentioned that societally Irish opinion moves slowly.  My party has also taken its time in coming to terms with recognising and realising there are circumstances which present and are real and we must face up to this.  I speak quite specifically about fatal foetal abnormalities.  We only came to a firm decision, by a majority and not unanimously, in March this year at our annual Ard-Fheis, which is our policy formulation vehicle.  The time it took frustrated many and others are discommoded by the decision taken.  In some way it is reflective of the broad range of opinion which makes up Irish societal opinion today.  We made a decision and have given effect to it with regard to opportunities that have presented in the D&aacute;il since.  Recently, we supported a Bill proposing the repeal of the eighth amendment.  In the context of our policy on this matter we most certainly will support efforts to bring about a repeal.<\/p><p> Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of how the debate is progressed with regard to trying to address the legislation which would follow, because legislation must follow when the Constitution is changed.  My sense is the greatest prospect for success would lie in a pre-signalled construction for the legislation which would follow.  Leaving it for a debate that would immediately follow, or follow at some point in time subsequently, would leave many people greatly unnerved.  If we are to make progress and see repeal of the eighth amendment, we need to be able to spell out for people what it is we as legislators are prepared to present subsequently.  This would help enormously in progressing the project for all the good and right reasons, namely, understanding, compassion and the realisation that we cannot, to all intents and purposes, continue to banish women from our shores to access a right that should be theirs here at home.  This is the position we hold.<\/p><p> I do not intend to pose a series of questions but I will point to one matter in Ms Zampas's closing remarks on the conclusions and recommendations.  I suspect Mr. O'Gorman knows as well as I do that when something new comes into the conversation, the Irish make-up is to say the position has moved.  I know about fatal foetal abnormalities because I led the argument and made the proposition.  Amnesty's document mentions severe and fatal foetal abnormalities.  I know immediately what this use of language will produce, and I ask the witnesses to take on board all of the difficulties many of us have had to get to where we are, never mind where many of us would like to be, believing it to be the correct place to arrive at.  I want to be a part of it for all the right and good reasons, none other.  The referencing used opens up the matter because where would one make this determination?  It would all become another cul-de-sac and I am concerned and worried in this respect.  I sincerely thank the witnesses for their contribution to what I have no doubt will be, as it always has been, a very intense debate and discussion which will go on for some time yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#E00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives for coming before the committee.  We are not in a position to ask very developed questions on the report but it certainly appears to be a very important and considered body of work which we will find useful and we will analyse it over the next while.  The witnesses mentioned it is part of Amnesty's global campaign, My Body My Rights.  Is Ireland the only European country featured in it?  Presumably this reflects the fact that we are significantly out of kilter on this issue <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other European countries.  Deputy Kelleher said it is a difficult issue to grapple with and it is, but everybody else seems to have managed it considerably better than we have.  From Amnesty's point of view, was Ireland ever part of another international Amnesty campaign or is this the only issue on which Ireland has been singled out?  If it is, I am not surprised, because it reflects Ireland's attitude to women.  Would it be fair to say in terms of Amnesty's research into Ireland's abortion laws that it reflects a situation which the former Minister for Justice and Equality articulated very well when he said that our Constitution means not all citizens are equal and that as a result of the eighth amendment pregnant women have a qualified right to health and bodily integrity, a scenario which does not apply to men?<\/p><p>Ireland is now putting itself on the world stage as being the ambassador of equality, and correctly so, in terms of same-sex marriage, but in terms of health, half our population, or slightly more than that, are unequal in terms of health provision.  Does Amnesty International's research vindicate that viewpoint?<\/p><p> We should move forward on all these issues.  Everyone knows we must repeal the eighth amendment.  Deputy Kelleher spoke about having a rational debate, but on the number of occasions we have had a debate on this issue in the D&aacute;il during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, every Member from every party who spoke said that there is a problem with the eighth amendment.  That, to me, must be our starting point.  They may have very different views on what happens next but everyone is agreed on that point.  I would challenge anyone to check the record on that and they will find that people said that something must be done about that.  That is something on which we can all find commonality.  Let us get rid of the eighth amendment because, clearly, we all agree it does not work.  Would our guests agree that for us to be human rights complaint, we need to do that?<\/p><p> We should not have this conversation in a vacuum.  We know that representatives of non-governmental organisations from Ireland are appearing before the UN Human Rights Committee.  We should know that figures were published today which show that 3,735 women of Irish addresses travelled to Britain to access abortion last year.  From our guests' findings and interviews with people, is it the case that the research leads them to believe that the consequence of the State's failure to provide access to safe abortion in Ireland does not change the Irish abortion rate, rather it just means, as was said, that we are outsourcing our human rights and health responsibilities, and to overcome that, we need not only to repeal the eighth amendment but also to provide for safe and legal abortion in all the circumstances they have outlined?  In fairness, the majority of people in Ireland have repeatedly stated in opinion polls that they agree with that in all those circumstances.  I do not see it as being a huge problem.  Have our guests come across a similar scenario anywhere else where human rights and access to health care was outsourced in a similar fashion?  It seems a peculiar abdication of the State's responsibility to put into the Constitution that people can access the health treatment of abortion but they cannot access it in Ireland and have to leave the country to access it.  That seems a very peculiar set-up.<\/p><p> I would consider myself a feminist and would be pro-choice but it is fair to say that Amnesty International is not those things.  I am not criticising our guests for that.  It is a different type of organisation but its stance on this issue has been dictated not by those motivations but very much by an analysis of human rights concerns, international human rights standards, international standards in terms of citizens' rights to exercise health care and their rights to bodily integrity.<\/p><p> In terms of the issue of criminalisation, I believe it was Deputy Kelleher who mentioned that he hopes we could have a thorough scrutiny of any new legislation like we did for the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  I sincerely hope it is dramatically better than that because that legislation criminalises people.  From the viewpoint of Amnesty International's international human rights defenders or observers, is it the case that Amnesty International is saying that criminalisation is a violation of people's human rights in all circumstances?  I think it is saying that and that certainly would be my view.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#F00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Deputy Conway, our Vice Chairman, and Senator Crown have indicated they wish to speak.

I have not got to read the report in great detail today but I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue with them.  I have some specific questions about the pieces I have read.  With respect to the closing arguments that were made about repealing the eighth amendment, that abortion be decriminalised and that the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act would have to be repealed, and Deputy Daly picked up on those, none of this can happen unless we repeal the eighth amendment.  That is the quandary in which we find ourselves.  That must be the launch pad for any conversation around this.  There will be differences of opinion about how and what comes after that, but none of this can happen unless we can repeal the eighth amendment.  I believe we should do that.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting that the World Health Organization's figures show that throughout the world approximately 800 pregnant women die every day.  As a young woman and a legislator, it jars with me that our development policy is far more progressive than our domestic policy.  Those 800 women a day who die in pregnancy due to childbirth, as per the WHO figures, live in developing countries.  Thankfully, childbirth here is relatively safe.  There are always difficulties, but relatively and most strikingly, that was not the case for Savita Halappanavar in Galway.  It is not correct to say that legislation in terms of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, as restrictive and as difficult as it is, happened because of Savita's case.  Her case completely changed public opinion.  That is what it did.  That legislation was trying to catch up with something that happened 21 years previously.  That shows that this legislation was hard fought for by many people over many years but society, opinion and circumstances have moved on considerably in that time.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of decriminalisation, one of the speakers made a comment about the procurement of illegal abortions in Ireland.  I would like to know a little more about that.  Was the speaker saying that the procurement of illegal abortions in Ireland is happening through people buying medication online, or that backstreet abortions are being carried out by unqualified people, or that qualified people are participating in abortions?  We know that women in Ireland have abortions every year but they have to travel to the UK.<\/p> <p>  I welcome again the publication of Amnesty International's report but it is shameful that this is the focus of it, that women are treated like this.  My position as an individual is very clear but, as other Deputies have said, we have to work to the middle ground in terms of repealing the eighth amendment.  That must be the first step.  None of the other things we want can happen unless we remove this amendment.  As a young parliamentarian, I would like the opportunity to vote on an issue like this because I am probably one of a very few number of people physically who could be in this position in the next ten years.  I also want to thank the very brave women and their partners, husbands and boyfriends who came forward and spoke about the issues around fatal foetal impairment and the treatment, if it could be called that, they have to go to Liverpool to get.  There has also being a seismic shift in public opinion on this issue and, to be fair, among legislators as well when they have heard these stories of these very brave families and the really awful way in which they are treated.  We need help from civil society.  We need to work together to make sure we get over the first hurdle of repealing the eighth amendment.  The committee has said it will give more time to this in its work programme following on from the commission report the Labour Party published under the lead of Senator Ivana Bacik.  I look forward to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#G00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending and for the report.  I have a position on abortion that makes everyone maximally unhappy.<\/p><p>While it may not have been hijacked, the debate is being driven by people at the two extremes, and a logical, considered, temperate, thoughtful, scientifically informed and unsentimental middle ground has not been allowed to develop.  The position that a two-cell, four-cell, eight-cell, 16-cell, 32-cell foetus, or a foetus a month or two old, with no working brain and no consciousness, movement or any of the characteristics that make a person a person, is a person with the same and equal rights as the mother who is its host is not logical.  It may be a good basis for a theological definition of when life begins and for an individual's personal morality, but it is not a good basis for public law or policy.  However, currently, it is the basis for the public policy we have, which is effectively that from the moment of conception, a two-cell or eight-cell foetus - although this has been interpreted by the courts as being only at the time of implantation, which can occur very quickly and with very few cells - assumes the full individual rights of a citizen.  This is not logical, and as a society we do not behave as if we believe that.  Even people who have an anti-abortion or pro-life position do not behave as if they believe that.  Otherwise, why, if we know that ten or 12 women are committing murder by travelling to England, would we not put police road blocks in place at all our airports and ports to stop them from travelling for abortions?  Why are we not carrying out mandatory pregnancy tests?  If in any other situation ten, 12 or 14 murders a day were taking place, people would be up in arms about it.  It is quite obvious that we do not believe this.  We believe that whatever abortion is, it is something different.  Therefore, if for no other reason than that, the case for repealing the eighth amendment is very strong.<\/p><p> As somebody who frequently has to make life-and-death decisions and have discussions with patients and their families about the level of intervention they would like in the event they become incapacitated or their prognosis becomes poor, I am very conscious that in general people are very comfortable with regard to doctors making decisions on when life ends.  This is historically true in jurisdictions all around the world.  However, they have not been as comfortable with allowing us decide when life begins.  Part of this problem is that this is our fault as a profession, because there has been a fair deal of moral cowardice.  People have brought their own pro-life and pro-choice prejudices into the debate with them and do not want to appear to be disloyal to their own intellectual or philosophical base by taking a position which may be at some variance with it.  For this reason, the part of my position which makes me unpopular with pro-choice people, having already burned my bridges with the pro-life people, is that while I believe it is absurd, medieval and theological to assume that a two-cell organism is a person, I also believe it is absurd, medieval and unbelievably inhumane to think that a 22-, 24- or 26-week-old foetus, which can move, has a nervous system and must be anaesthetised before it can be dismembered in the course of a late-term abortion, is not a human.  The ultimate logic of the pro-choice position, a viewpoint I have heard articulated, is \"It is my body and I can do whatever I want with it at any time, up to and including 40 weeks.\"  If there is a campaign to repeal the eighth amendment, I will support it, because I believe it is a bad amendment that ties the hands of legislators.  In the highly likely event that I am still in Parliament at that stage, I may well support some other kind of replacement legislation, which will make me massively unpopular with many other people.<\/p><p> I have a question for the three witnesses.  As representatives of Amnesty International, a premier human rights organisation, when do they believe a foetus becomes a person who should enjoy the protection of Amnesty International?  At what stage do they think should Amnesty become involved?  Would Amnesty International ever go into a country where abortions are legal at 34 or 36 weeks, where children can be removed from the womb and after they have moved and made noise be allowed to die on a table?  Would they ever think it is their job, as part of Amnesty International, to defend their rights?  I would like to hear Amnesty International's position on this, because I need to inform how I will think about this in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#G00400","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Two other members have indicated that they wish to speak.

I support the repeal of the eighth amendment because I do not believe this issue should have a place in our Constitution or that it is a constitutional issue.  Deputy Kelleher said earlier that the difficulty in any referendum campaign is that it is rarely about what we are asking the public.  We need to be very clear about what we want in place of what we have.  We would probably all find difficulties with any legislation on this, based on what has been articulated.  The issues Amnesty International has highlighted are issues I would support, but I also agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questioning in regard to terminology surrounding severe and fatal foetal impairment.  That is new wording as far as we are concerned in this debate.<\/p> <p>  An issue that has not been raised is one I became very conscious of during the debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  In our debate, we talk about the number of women who travel daily to Britain for abortions, but we do not talk about children who end up in the care of the State and who do not have that choice.  That protection is not there for them.  These are often children who have been raped by a family member.  What choices and rights do these children have?  Regretfully, I have come across cases involving these children whom we have totally and utterly failed.  These children are put into the care of the State because we as legislators cannot come together and make laws in this area.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate what has been said about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  However, while I believe the debates and hearings we had were a good model, our debate was restricted by the Constitution.  If we could have a wider debate, it would be useful for us to tease out the issues.  Before we had our debates, I was not clear on my position, but the debate helped me to become comfortable with my position.  We need to find a forum that is not focused on one or the other end of the spectrum, where one feels one has to apologise for standing in the middle and for not being strongly in favour of one end.  We must try to see how many people we can bring to the centre to try to work out how they feel about this.  We know how people at each end who are shouting out on this issue feel, but we must work out how we feel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#H00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to leave the meeting for a few minutes.

Before I came to this House, I was clear in my head - or so I thought - that I did not agree with abortion in any shape or form.  My attitude was &quot;No way, Jos&eacute;,&quot; in any circumstances.  I acknowledge that this was a result of my upbringing and faith and that this had been drilled into me.  In the past number of years that view has been challenged at many levels and in many circumstances, but I am still afraid of the issue.  I know that may sound stupid, but I do not know what the world will look like after we have had this conversation.  I acknowledge, however, that we need to have the conversation.<\/p><p>We need to tease out what is acceptable to Irish people if the eighth amendment is repealed and under what circumstances abortion should be permitted.  We have had proposal after proposal put forward that abortion be permitted in cases of rape, for example, but we have never had a proper conversation with middle Ireland on what people believe is acceptable and agreeable or on how far we should go.  Now, in 2015, it is time for that conversation.  I believe we should have that conversation before we have a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, because we cannot ask people to repeal it without knowing what will be in its place afterwards.  I do not know whether this is something we should put to a special constitutional convention, but it should be put to people who are reflective of Irish society, not just the extremes on both sides.  With respect, we all know what they feel.  As Senator van Turnhout said, we need to capture the feelings of everybody else.  We must acknowledge the fears that exist, but have the conversation.  I am ready to have that conversation now.  I was not ready before, but I acknowledge that we need to have it now.

Ireland is changing.  We have all recognised that in recent weeks.  For what seems like a very long time under successive Governments, this topic was not spoken about openly.  It may have been discussed but certainly not in the context in which we are doing so now.  Starting the conversation is very important in light of what has happened in recent weeks.<\/p><p> I am a mother and a grandmother, and I regard my children as the greatest gift ever given to me.  I went through a time in my life when I had a number of miscarriages and felt the devastation that caused.  I agree with Deputy Regina O'Doherty that it is frightening to think of what is happening outside this House, but without all the information, the figures and the stories, which have been well reported, it is difficult for somebody like me to ask any questions of the witnesses.  Along with most people in the room, I would like to be able to debate this issue and listen to those stories.  This is not about decisions.  It is about believing that what we do here as legislators gives everybody equal opportunities and so on.  We have restarted this conversation and we should let it flitter away.<\/p><p> Like many other members, I have met people in my constituency office who had experienced the trauma of foetal abnormality, and on many occasions following those meetings I went home deeply shocked and upset by their stories.  Some of them were very close to home.  As legislators we have to have all the facts and information but, above all, we must be compassionate in our decisions, because that is what this is about.  It is about compassion, putting ourselves into other people's shoes and listening to what they have to say.<\/p><p> I have nothing further to add.  I do not have questions but I agree with the previous speakers that this is about human beings.  In fairness to Senator Crown, whom I do not always agree with, he speaks with great knowledge about the medical aspects.

Ultimately, they must face the electorate and people in their own constituencies, so I thank them for engaging and for taking our contributions seriously.<\/p> <p>  We met yesterday with people from the Executive branch, the Minister for Health and the T&aacute;naiste, and raised many of these issues with them, but we believe the meeting with this parliamentary committee is probably the most important one.  The questions members asked us today as to the process from here on and what replaces the eighth amendment are relevant, but who will give the answers to those?  We have some thoughts, but this committee has to move the process forward.  It has to come up with a framework and a process which will help us to move forward, because nobody is saying there is not a problem.  Everybody accepts there is a real challenge here.  If there is one thing this report can do, it is that it will contribute to the process moving forward, not in an open-ended way but in a time-bound manner in that it has a clear end date.  Elections come and go, but this is affecting 4,000 women every year.  It is a very serious issue and I hope the committee can find a concrete way in the coming weeks to take it forward.  I hope an action plan of some sort will come out of it.<\/p> <p>  I want to restate what we said earlier, because it is important when we are asked what will replace the eighth amendment, etc., and what is our position on the issue.  Our position is essentially in line with international human rights standards, and those are clear.  Abortion should be decriminalised in all circumstances.  The criminalisation of a woman who is already going through such suffering does not make sense.  Very few countries criminalise, and we would not expect Ireland to be in that group of countries.  Beyond that, we say clearly that it is not only the risk to life but the risk to mental and physical health that must be taken into consideration.  Abortion services should be available for women who become pregnant from rape, incest and sexual assault.  In the case of foetal impairment, we can come to the question of severe and fatal, which Ms Zampas can clarify.  That is our position.  We hope it can inform the discussion when members consider what happens next.  That is our contribution.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is in a unique position on this subject, but in terms of the international stage, if the Irish ambassador or representative was sitting on the Human Rights Council and one of the countries which came up for review said that in that country freedom of expression is not allowed because there is a constitutional provision which prevents that, the Irish representative would say it is time it changed its constitution.  Similarly, if we were told by a country that the death penalty was very much in our faith and culture, that would be challenged by an Irish representative to the effect that that is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>  On both counts I would appeal to this committee to think about the way forward and the next steps because I suspect there is no other body which can make that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Salil Shetty"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I put it to Mr. Shetty that the committee itself cannot change the Constitution-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#J00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433866800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Salil Shetty"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":627,"content":"<p>-----so that, therefore, is a matter for the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#J00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433866800,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Salil Shetty"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":629,"content":"<p>What exactly is Mr. Shetty calling for in the context of the report?

When our global movement adopted this policy position in 2007, Amnesty International in Ireland voted against it.  When it was adopted we accepted that was the position of our international movement, but our members made it clear that we would not work on this issue at that point.  We have been on our own journey on this as well.<\/p> <p>  Amnesty International's position on access to abortion as adopted in 2007 was not a particularly progressive position.  We have elaborated on and moved that position forward in significant ways since that time.<\/p><p>We are a part of all of that.  One of the important statements that Amnesty Ireland needs to make is that, as members of Amnesty International who work with the organisation in Ireland, we are part of a society that has been described by former Ministers for Health at various times as pathologically incapable of having a rational, objective conversation about an issue like abortion.  We need to own this.  It references much of what Deputy Kelleher discussed.<\/p><p> I wish to address a question that he also raised about the case of Savita Halappanavar.  Ms Zampas might discuss this matter.  As all of the reports established, Savita's death was the result of medical negligence.  However, we are clear in our view that, if Ireland had had a human rights-compliant framework of abortion in law and in practice, Savita Halappanavar could have been alive today.  The issues that led to the grave risk to her life and that resulted in medical negligence becoming a factor would likely not have arisen had she been granted a termination at the point when she requested it and when it was clear that she was experiencing an inevitable miscarriage.  It is worth pointing out that her death moved public opinion.  It also empowered public opinion to be articulated in a way that it had not been previously.<\/p><p> This morning, it was sobering to hear Dr. Mahony make it clear in her presentation when we launched the report that the Act did not address the circumstances surrounding Savita's death.  I am sure that Ms Zampas will discuss cases.  One case mentioned in the report arose three months after Savita died in the same hospital and involved the same circumstances.  Many medical experts gave information as part of the research to make it very clear to us that we are still, as Dr. Mahony stated this morning and as Senator Crown, with his expertise, would speak to, playing medical roulette with women's lives and health.  Doctors are forced to sit back and not intervene.  They can see that a woman will inevitably become ill, then seriously ill and finally gravely ill, but they must wait for the moment in which they can make a determination of a real and substantial risk to her life.  As Dr. Mahony asked, does that mean a 10%, 20%, 50% or 80% chance of death?  All the time, the doctors must remember that, if they act and a clinical view is arrived at in future that there was not a real and substantial risk, the woman and the practitioner will face up to 14 years in prison.  We are still operating in this context.<\/p><p> We must be clear about what we are saying about Savita's case, but we must baldly state that it is likely that she would still be alive if Ireland had had a human rights-compliant framework for abortion at the time that she presented at the hospital in Galway.<\/p><p> On the question of what would replace the current set-up and how to carry the debate forward, I noted Deputy Doherty's comments about some of the comments being made because we have published this report, for example, presenting Amnesty as a pro-abortion lobby group.  I will ask those who respond in that way to read the report and to engage with the testimony, evidence and research presented therein.  We are not going to engage in a vitriolic shouting match with those who may have previously created a heat around this debate that has caused all of us to run away from it since.  The human rights violations that we have identified in this research require that we do not do so.  I am encouraged by the nature of how this debate has developed politically and the responses that we have received from the committee at this meeting on the clear need for this debate.<\/p><p> Let us be clear.  This is a controversial, complex and difficult issue.  In Ireland, our major difficulty is our fear of how this debate went previously rather than of where we might go in the conversation.  We have been frightened and cowed out of having the conversation because of the heat and vitriol that often accompanies it.  As executive director of Amnesty International in Ireland, I want to make it clear that Amnesty will be a part of ensuring that we have this conversation.  We will not be shouted down or intimidated away from it.  The lives and human rights of the women and girls who spoke to us and of those who will face grave violations as a consequence of Ireland's law on abortion require that we do so.  We are a human rights organisation.  We are not a lobby group or a pro-abortion group.  Unless those who would present that view also want to accuse all of the treaty monitoring bodies of the United Nations of being pro-abortion lobby groups, their position on this point has little depth or merit.<\/p><p> As everyone has mentioned, opinion in Ireland seems to be strongly on board with the minimal obligations required by international human rights standards, which were adopted and written by states and legislators and are binding.  We are asking states, including Ireland, to respect those obligations.<\/p><p> I will ask Ms Zampas to answer the question on severe and fatal foetal impairment, as it was an important one that we want to address properly.<\/p><p> To answer Deputy Daly, Ireland is the only country in Europe that features in the My Body My Rights campaign.  We agree with Deputy Shatter, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, that gender discrimination is at the heart of the violations that are under discussion.  We believe that Ireland is outsourcing its human rights obligations, which is unacceptable.<\/p><p> The other country that we examined in respect of this issue is El Salvador.  I was there last September for the launch of a similar report.  In some ways, El Salvador is Ireland without access to England - that is unless women have money.  Its abortion law is even stricter, with abortion banned in all circumstances, including risk to life.  Poor, rural and, often, young women experience the impacts of El Salvador's approach whereas those who have money travel.<\/p><p> We agree with Deputy Conway that nothing can happen until after we have repealed the eighth amendment, which is why that forms one of our overarching recommendations.  On the broader question of the political process that needs to happen, though, that is a matter for legislators.  We are available to support and inform the process in any way that legislators believe is appropriate.  We will be a part of the public debate that must follow to support the work that legislators will need to do.  It makes obvious sense that, in tabling a proposal to amend the Constitution, legislators need to be clear about its impacts.  It seems sensible to suggest that a clear framework be decided, developed and delivered.  Consistent with international human rights law, Amnesty's position is that abortion should be decriminalised and instead addressed through the civil code and medical regulation.  This is a discussion that we might develop at some point.<\/p><p> I was struck by Deputy Conway's comment about how, as a young woman, she had a particular interest in this.  I recently made the point - others have made it also - that there are few people directly affected by the eighth amendment who voted on it.  Those most affected by it have never had their say.  This is something that we need to address.<\/p><p> I appreciated Senator Crown's input.  I will hand over to Ms Zampas so that she can deal with his question on how and where states should begin providing protection for prenatal life.<\/p><p> To be clear, I understood that Senator van Turnhout was referring to the situation of children in the care of the State who found themselves in crisis pregnancies.  Our understanding is that there are circumstances in which the State provides for children in care to travel to access terminations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>It is not necessarily a consistent practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#K00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433866800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>No.  The Senator is pointing out something that the research and our report made clear, in that it is marginalised women and girls who are most at risk of grave human rights violations as a result of our particularly restrictive framework.<\/p> <p>  I have answered everything, so Ms Zampas might address some of the legal questions.

I will not repeat what Mr. O'Gorman stated, but I want to say something about the Savita situation and the case of Lupe, who is mentioned in our report.<\/p><p>She was in a very similar situation.  She had a wanted pregnancy and she was miscarrying.  She went to the hospital for a scan which indicated that there was no foetal heartbeat but they told her to come back the following week just to make sure.  She ended up carrying a dead foetus for two months.  At one point she realised that she could get an infection and she could be Savita.  She went back to Spain, her home country, and doctors there could not believe that she had not been given an abortion.  Dr. Mahony referred to how it does not make clinical sense to equate the constitutional protection of the unborn with the right to life of the pregnant woman.  To repeat what Mr. O'Gorman has said, the distinction between health and life is not a distinction for the law to make.  It is a distinction to be made in a clinical setting by a pregnant woman, in consultation with her doctor.<\/p><p> Severe foetal impairment is a very difficult issue.  The easy answer is that human rights bodies recognise that the human rights implications of denying women who have had pregnancies which are severe could be that women will seek abortions anyway, but I think it is much more difficult than that.  We have a story of a woman who wanted to be called Laoise's mother.  She had a very wanted pregnancy.  She and her husband were very happy about it.  The pregnancy was diagnosed with a severe foetal impairment.  Her decision to terminate her pregnancy was not an easy one.  When we were drafting the report, it was very difficult for her to include it in the report.  Finally she agreed and she came out and thought it was very important.  She took part in a recent meeting with stakeholders where she said she was happy it was in the report.  It is not up to Amnesty to make the call on what is severe or not.  We are not a medical organisation.  We would never want to see a list of what is severe.  It is a clinical decision to be made between a patient and her doctor.  These are judgments to be made in a clinical setting.  We are a human rights organisation.  We are not going to list the grounds on which women can have abortions for severe foetal impairment, but we will follow international human rights standards.<\/p><p> Deputy Daly referred to other countries in Europe.  Malta is the only other country in the EU that has a stricter law than Ireland.  In the 47 Council of Europe member states, the only other countries that have stricter laws are the micro states of Andorra and San Marino.  Malta, Andorra and San Marino have a total ban on abortion.  In regard to pregnant women having a qualified right and how the eighth amendment works, our report describes how pregnant women in non-abortion related settings are being treated in maternal health care settings, so it is not just related to abortion.  That could be the topic of a whole other report.  There is one story that stands out, to which we wished to dedicate more time in terms of the report, but we want to make it clear that the eighth amendment impacts on all pregnant women, not just those seeking abortion.<\/p><p> In regard to the criminalising of abortion, we follow human rights standards.  Human rights bodies have called for the decriminalisation of abortion in all circumstances, to take it out of the criminal code and not punish women and doctors.  We know what happens when there is a criminal law governing abortion.  It stops women from seeking care, even post-abortion care, it hinders providers from making decisions that are in the best interests of their patients and it reinforces a stigma and treats women as outcasts.  That is why we also call for decriminalisation, and we believe there are other ways to regulate.  There are professional sanctions which can be imposed on doctors; their licences can be removed, etc.  Some of the doctors to whom we spoke were concerned about the criminalising of abortion hovering over them, but they also spoke about professional sanction, and to some that is almost worse: to have their licence taken away or to be ostracised by their peers in the medical community.<\/p><p> Deputy Conway asked about how illegal abortions happen in Ireland.  This is dealt with towards the end of our report.  Women who cannot travel, usually the most vulnerable women and asylum seekers, spoke to us about how they considered suicide.  One woman spoke about how she calculated throwing herself in front of a truck or jumping off a bridge.  It appears that women are taking the medical abortion pills here.  Sandra's story, which is on page 94 of the report, tells how she procured the pills online.  We want to be clear that medical abortion is very safe.  The WHO has it on the essential medicines list for abortion.  It is extremely safe and it is the safest methods of illegal abortions, safer than any other method.  Around the world, especially in countries where women cannot travel and where abortion is prohibited or extremely restricted, like in Latin America, taking the pills have actually saved women's lives and have reduced maternal mortality.  However, that is not an answer to changing the laws.  The pills should be taken with medical supervision but we think that is probably one of the ways in which women are having illegal abortions here.<\/p><p> Reference was made to gestational limits.  Amnesty's policy is that states could put reasonable limits on abortion and that could be the licensing of doctors, regulating of facilities that provide abortions, and gestational limits.  Most countries have gestational limits.  No country in Europe allows abortion on request to the end of pregnancy.  It allows abortion until end of pregnancy when women's lives or health is in danger.  Late term abortions do not happen because a woman makes a conscious choice to delay having the abortion.  There are reasons they happen late.  In the US less than 1% of abortions are late term abortions, but we see those who oppose abortion use this as a way to discuss the issue.  They have co-opted the language of \"partial-birth abortion\" etc.  Viability would be a reasonable gestational limit so we support those limits.  Amnesty believes the best way to protect pre-natal life is to provide maternal health care services.  In Ireland, the best way to protect pregnant women and those seeking abortions would be to repeal the eighth amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Christina Zampas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Ms Zampas outlined that there were more than 60 interviews.

In the context of a hearing like this it is very difficult to articulate much of the testimony of the women and girls we interviewed.  I know it is challenging for members to get through everything they are given to read.  However, if they have time at all it would be incredibly valuable for them to read some of that testimony.<\/p> <p>  Ms Zampas spoke of Lupe, a woman who was required to return to a hospital in Ireland for a scan every week for two months before she finally gave up and travelled to Spain to access an abortion.  I do not intend to be too graphic here, but we need to be blunt about this.  When she travelled she was bleeding all the way and frightened about the impact of a pregnancy that she knew could not possibly continue because she knew that the foetus had died.  That took place three months after Ms Savita Halappanavar died.  That is one of the cases I particularly ask members to pay attention to.<\/p> <p>  I have a request to make of the committee.  Earlier Deputy Conway indicated that the committee may have plans to look at foetal impairment at some point.  If at all possible we would like the committee to begin this conversation in a way that seeks to move it forward.  Hopefully this evening's hearing will be a start to that and we really value the opportunity to appear before the committee.  We need to begin the process of both the political and public conversation that needs to happen if we are to move the issue forward.<\/p> <p>  We would be incredibly grateful to the committee if in deciding its work programme in coming weeks it could open up a discussion on reviewing the eighth amendment and Ireland's legal and policy framework with regard to abortion.  That would be an incredibly valuable contribution in seeking to move some of this forward.  I do not underestimate the challenge involved in that.  However, for those of us, including many members of the committee who have made it clear, who are understandably committed to finding a way to move some of this process forward, we cannot continue to wait until we have another tragedy.  It is certain that if the committee, the Government and the Legislature do not act, at some point - it could be at any moment - we will be facing into another crisis, another tragedy where another girl or woman has lost her life or we face another macabre horrific situation on par with the one we faced towards the end of last year.<\/p> <p>  I thank members of the committee for giving their time and we look forward to engaging with them on the matter in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015060900002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman"},{"type":"speech","time":1433866800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Christina Zampas, Mr. Colm O'Gorman and Mr. Salil Shetty for their presence and testimony this afternoon, and for the report that is before us.

As Deputy Kelleher has rightly said it is an issue that has polarised Irish society for over 40 years.  We have been able to show that we can debate the matter in this committee in a civilised manner and I hope we will continue to do that in future deliberations.  The committee will at a future date as part of our work programme discuss what, if anything, we will do.  I have made my view clear that it is important for us to have a national conversation along the lines of the Convention on the Constitution, of which I was a member and which did sterling work.  It would be a very important forum within which to bring together the different viewpoints within civic society.
