This proposal is to allow each member state decide if they wish to permit or ban the import and use of GM food and feed in their territory.  The proposal states that such prohibitions or restrictions must be reasoned and based on compelling grounds and must not conflict with the EFSA risk assessment.<\/p> <p>  Genetic modification is a science-based technology which, in the case of plants, alters the gene structure in a way that does not occur naturally through fertilisation or natural recombination.  This modification confers certain traits on the plant that can be advantageous to agriculture and food-feed production.  However the application of the technology has proven to be controversial.  Current EU legislation defines a GMO as \"an organism, with the exception of human beings, in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and\/or natural recombination\".<\/p> <p>  According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, 18 million farmers in 28 countries planted more than 181 million ha of GM crops in 2014.  Cultivation is concentrated in five countries with 90% planted in the USA, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada.  The main GM crops cultivated are maize, soyabean, cotton and oilseed rape.  While herbicide-tolerance and insect resistance are the predominant traits of the commercialised GM crops, there is an increasing spectrum of traits emerging, which include drought and salinity tolerance, yield enhancement through more efficient use of nutrients, disease resistance, improved nutrition content and improved food safety profile. <\/p> <p>  The cultivation and marketing of GM crops within the EU is strictly controlled by EU-wide legislation which has been jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  In the past 15 years the European Union has introduced a suite of regulations governing the safety, labelling, marketing and traceability of GM crops, food and feed.  Central to these regulations are four main legislative acts, namely: directive (2001\/18\/EC), which outlines the conditions for the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and sets out aspects of the risk assessment required prior to their release; Regulation 1829\/2003 which sets out the conditions for authorisation, supervision and marketing of GMOs for food and feed use; Regulation 1830\/2003 establishes the conditions for labelling and traceability of GM food and feed; and the contained use directive (2009\/41\/EC), which lays down measures for the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms.<\/p><p>The main aim of the legislation is to give the consumer a clear choice, through labelling, between GM and non-GM products and the confidence that all GM products placed on the EU market are safe for human and animal consumption and to the environment and can be traced back to source.<\/p><p> The authorisation procedure is that GM crops, food and feed are subject to a comprehensive risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority before they are authorised for use in the EU.  The risk assessment is designed to ensure GM crops and GM food and feed do not pose a risk to human health, animal health and the environment.  Preparation of an application to have a new GM crop cultivated in the EU or to have a new GM food or feed derived from a GM crop authorised for import and use in the EU is the responsibility of the breeder.  The application must be prepared according to standard guidelines established by EFSA and the OECD.  Experts in EFSA then carry out a risk assessment of the data presented in the application to ensure the GM crop, food and feed are safe for human health, animal health and the environment.<\/p><p> Following a favourable opinion from the EFSA, the European Commission presents a draft proposal to the EU regulatory committee on GMOs, that is, the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,  SCoPAFF, for vote on approval or rejection of the application for authorisation in the EU.  If no qualified majority is achieved for or against the application, the proposal is submitted to the higher level appeals committee.  If no majority is achieved at the appeals committee, the proposal reverts to the Commission for final decision.<\/p><p> To date, no application to authorise a GM crop for cultivation or for food and feed use has received a qualified majority at standing committee level.  In general, votes have been split approximately 12 in favour, 12 against and three or four abstentions.  The decision then reverts to the Commission which has generally approved the applications in line with standard EU policy.  Once a GM product is approved, the authorisation is valid for ten years.  To date, 57 GMOs have been approved for food and feed use in the EU.  However, only one of these, namely, MON810, an insect resistant maize, has been approved for cultivation.  Of the 57 approved, 30 are maize, 12 soya bean, ten cotton, four oilseed rape and one sugar beet.<\/p><p> The GM maize, MON810, is cultivated in five EU member states, namely, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia.  The total GM maize plantings in the EU in 2014 amounted to 143,000 hectares, with over 90% of this cultivated in Spain.  All applications for authorisation by the EU to place food and feed products consisting of or containing genetically modified ingredients in the EU market are considered individually following a comprehensive evaluation of the GMO by the EFSA.  In line with Government policy of adopting a positive but precautionary approach on biotechnology, a common voting position is adopted by Ireland for food and feed on the basis of a favourable opinion from the EFSA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p> The comprehensive risk evaluation procedure adopted by the EU has given rise to a time lag between the EU and third country authorisations, thus leading to trade difficulties between the EU and the main global exporting countries of GM crops, namely, the USA, Brazil, Argentina and Canada.  New GM crops that are authorised and cultivated in North and South America are generally not authorised for a period of one to two years later in the EU, leading to rejection of unauthorised shipments of maize and soya bean at EU ports.  Rejection of these shipments occurs due to the zero tolerance in the EU of unauthorised GM crops.  This disparity in authorisation timing, known as asynchronous authorisation, has given rise to considerable difficulties for the Irish and EU trade, and alteration to the EU authorisation process as suggested in the current proposal is likely to give rise to similar difficulties in the shipment of feed materials to Ireland.<\/p><p> Regulation of GM crops in Ireland is shared between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Health.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has primary responsibility for the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment as governed by Directive 2001\/18\/EC.<\/p><p>The Department is also responsible for the authorisation of GMO trials, both field and contained-use, including genetically modified micro-organisms.  The EPA assists the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in risk assessment and the setting of conditions for the conduct of the trials, as well as conditions for deliberate release.  The Department of Health has responsibility for the use of GMOs as regards food.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for the import and use of GM feed, as well as control measures for cultivation post-commercialisation, should that arise.<\/p><p> The European Union is only 35% self-sufficient in protein supplies for animal feed.  Soybean is the most favoured vegetable protein because of its nutritional efficacy and competitive cost.  In Ireland up to 80% of animal feed for ruminants is provided by grass, hay and silage, complemented, where appropriate, by compound feeds.  In the case of pigs and poultry, virtually all of their nutrition is derived from compound feeds.  The Irish cereal harvest is generally in the region of 2.2 millions tonnes per annum, of which approximately 1.7 million tonnes are used for animal feed, with the remainder being used in the food and drinks sector.<\/p><p> On average, Ireland imports 3 million tonnes of animal feed materials per annum.  In addition, approximately 1.7 million tonnes of home-grown cereals are used in the production of feed, bringing the total usage of feed materials to approximately 4.7 million tonnes.  Some 66% of these feed materials is used for ruminant feed - 16% for pigs, 12% for poultry and 6% for other animals.  Of the 3 million tonnes imported, approximately 55% is sourced from third countries outside the European Union, mainly Argentina, the United States, Ukraine, Canada and Brazil.  More than 1.2 million tonnes of soy and maize GM products were imported into Ireland for animal feed in 2014, constituting 40% of total feed imports.  The main commodities imported are maize and maize by-products, soybean meal and soy hulls and rapeseed meal.  Up to 90% of the soybean and maize products imported from Argentina, Brazil and the United States is derived from genetically modified crops.  Significant quantities of non-GM maize and oilseed rape meal are imported from continental Europe, including Ukraine.<\/p><p> Ireland is especially dependent on feed imports relative to other EU member states in that approximately two thirds of the feed materials marketed here are imported, compared with, for instance, 37% in the United Kingdom, 27% in France and 26% in Germany.  The pig and poultry sectors which employ almost 10,000 personnel in production and processing are particularly impacted on, as soybean is an essential ingredient in the formulation of these feed rations.<\/p><p> The Food and Feed Chain Coalition, FFC, which represents ten EU member organisations from different parts of the food and feed chain has expressed its opposition to the proposal from the European Commission, as has the Irish Grain and Feed Association, IGFA.  The animal feed industry in Ireland considers the import of significant quantities of soybean and maize from North and South America where GMO cultivation is widespread as essential to satisfy the protein fraction in animal nutrition.  Trading difficulties have arisen in the past owing to zero tolerance of unauthorised GM crops.  Further difficulties with such imports are likely to be exacerbated in the future as an increasing number of GM crop varieties are cultivated in North and South America in advance of authorisations being achieved in the European Union.  In previous years the United States has delayed the cultivation of new GM varieties to ensure compatibility with EU authorisations, but this practice is increasingly difficult to implement owing to the widespread adoption of stacked or multiple GM traits in GM crops.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and will be happy to answer questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ryan and invite Mr. Canning to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#L00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433854800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving the Department the opportunity to speak about the proposal to amend the current regulation and the basis for it.  The Commission is proposing to allow member states in certain circumstances to restrict or prohibit the use of authorised genetically modified food or feed in their territories.<\/p><p>It is proposed that member states be allowed to make use of this &quot;opt-out&quot; provision, subject to their being able to justify the restriction or prohibition on a case by case basis.<br\/><br\/>Under the existing provisions laid down in Regulation EC 1829\/2003, only authorised GM food or feed may be placed on the EU market and when present in a food or feed at greater than a figure of 0.9%, it must be labelled accordingly.  The current regulation also sets out a centralised procedure for the safety assessment and authorisation of food and feed from a GM source.  Even where a genetically modified organism, GMO, or a product derived from a GMO is to be used only in animal feed, its safety with respect to human food is also assessed and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The authorisation procedure put in place by the regulation ensures the products concerned will not pose a risk to human and animal health and the environment.  The authorisation of a GM food or feed in the European Union begins with a safety assessment carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, a risk assessment body established under the regulation.  Each application is assessed on a case by case basis and once the dossier has been deemed complete by the EFSA, it forms the basis for an authorisation or rejection proposal which is then presented by the Commission to member states to be voted on at standing committee level.  <br\/><br\/>As our colleague has outlined, since the entry into force of Regulation EC 1829\/2003, a qualified majority of member states has never been achieved either for or against authorisation of a GM food or feed.  The applications are, therefore, sent to the appeals committee to try to reach a majority decision.  Where this is not achieved, an application is sent to the Commission for final decision.  The Commission has stated the reasons given by many member states to justify abstaining in votes or rejecting applications are usually not based on science but on other considerations.  Where there is scientific evidence demonstrating that an authorised GM product is likely to pose a risk to human or animal health or the environment, the regulation allows the Commission or member states to adopt emergency measures restricting or prohibiting the placing on the market of the product.  This is the only basis allowed to member states to restrict the placing of GM food or feed on the market once a product has been  authorised.<br\/><br\/>The Commission is proposing to amend Regulation EC 1829\/2003 to provide that individual member states may, subject to certain conditions, adopt measures to restrict or prohibit the use of GM food and feed on part or all of their territories.  There is a series of caveats set out in the recitals to the proposal, which are as follows: the member state must be able to justify the prohibition or restriction on the grounds of an overriding public interest in accordance with Article 36 of the treaty as developed by the case law of the European Court of Justice; the measures must not infringe Article 34 of the treaty on the free movement of goods; the measures must be reasoned and compatible with the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination between national and non-national products; as stated, the reasons for prohibition or restriction cannot be linked with health risks as they are already dealt with centrally by the EFSA and the emergency measures covered in Regulation EC 1829\/2003; and the measures cannot be used to prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of products containing less than 0.9% GM material, which products are already dealt with under the existing regulation.  Essentially, this means that products containing adventitious or technically unavoidable amounts of GM material are not required to be labelled as containing GM material.<br\/><br\/>Under the new provisions, the prohibition or restriction of a GM product by a member state may only occur after the GM product has been authorised.  This process will thus not affect the procedure for authorisation of GM food and feed which will remain valid for the whole of the European Union.  Once a GM product is authorised in the European Union, it may be marketed in all member states, including Ireland.  GM food ingredients authorised in the European Union include soya bean, maize, oilseed rape, cotton, sugar beet and starch potato.  Under the current regulation, if more that 0.9% of a food or ingredient is derived from a GM source, it must be labelled accordingly.<br\/><br\/>GM foods are not generally sold in Ireland, a situation similar to that in other EU member states.  An evaluation of the EU legislative framework for food and feed published in June 2010 by DG Sanco suggests this is because food markets have evolved towards the dominant use of non-GM supply chains.  Monitoring of the Irish marketplace has been co-ordinated by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland since 2001, which ensures only authorised GM foods or ingredients are on the market and that consumers are allowed to purchase or avoid these products by virtue of accurate labelling.<\/p><p>Sampling and analysis of GM foods are mainly concentrated on processed food containing soya, maize or rice as these are foods where GM ingredients are more commonly found.  Inspection results are published on the FSAI website and demonstrate that only a small proportion of foods analysed contain GM ingredients but that these are generally authorised GM ingredients and are below the labelling threshold of 0.9%. <\/p><p> To date, Ireland has always adopted a science-based but precautionary approach to GM foods while consumer choice has been ensured by adequate monitoring of the marketplace.  This new Commission proposal provides member states with a unilateral means of prohibiting or restricting the marketing of EU-authorised GM food and feed ingredients in their territories without having to resort to emergency measures provided for under article 34 of the regulation.  The proposal does not define the reasons that can be invoked by member states other than to stipulate that they cannot be based on perceived risks to human or animal health or the environment.  The Department of Health is of the view that the provisions of the legislation currently in place for authorising GM food and feed in the EU provide adequate science-based safeguards in the context of human and animal safety and the environment. <\/p><p> We are available for any questions members may have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gregory Canning","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433854800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Ar an ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba maith liom bu&iacute;ochas a tabhairt duith a Chathaoirleach for inviting the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss COM (2015) 177 pertaining to GM food and feed.  At the end of this opening statement, I would be happy to answer any questions that members might have and if I am unable to provide answers today, I will arrange for the relevant information to be forwarded to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The EPA is the competent authority in Ireland for the implementation of the genetically modified organisms, GMO, regulations on the contained use in laboratories and the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.  This could be for a field trial or a clinical trial in hospital.  The agency was nominated as the competent authority to administer the regulations in Ireland and the commencement date for implementation was 1 January 1995.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for national policy for GMOs and the environment.  I think one of the previous papers said that it is the EPA which gives consent for both contained use and field trials.  Other regulatory agencies involved in the regulation of GMOs in Ireland include the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which is the body for GM medicines and medicines derived from GMOs.<\/p> <p>  What are GMOs?  GMOs are defined as bacteria, viruses, fungi, plant and animal cells, plants and animals that are capable of replication or of transferring genetic material in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating or natural recombination.  In the last 39 years, the development and use of GMO or genetic engineering, GE, technology has brought many useful applications in health care in the form of new pharmaceuticals, vaccines and new methods of diagnosing disease.  An example is insulin which has saved millions of lives over the past 30 years.  Insulin is important for people who suffer from diabetes and 100% of it is now made using GM technology.  This technology is also making a major impact in the investigation of crime, waste treatment, environmental clean up and other areas.<\/p> <p>  The EPA's remit is to implement the GMO regulations in Ireland pertaining to the contained use and deliberate release into the environment.  What does the licensing of GMO users in Ireland mean?  In practice, what this means is that anyone who wants to use a GMO in a laboratory or in a field or clinical trial, which involves deliberate release into the environment, must first obtain a licence from the EPA.  By 1 June 2015, there were 579 entries on the register of GMO users in Ireland, more than 95% of which are contained users.  A total of 98% of this use relates to genetically modified micro-organisms, GMMs, that are used in laboratories and are categorised as low- risk categories - class 1-2 GMM - and GM animals which are used for medical research.  Quite a number of researchers in Ireland use GM mice.  Class 1 encompasses researchers looking at bacteria that produce antibiotics.<\/p><p>The class 2 category includes the use of genetically modified viruses for the production of vaccines.<\/p><p> Currently, there is one GM field trial that has been ongoing since 2012.  This relates to a GM potato which is tolerant to the late potato blight fungus.  This has been planted for the past four years and next year will be the last year of planting.  This work is being conducted at Oak Park by Teagasc and is part of a larger European-funded project called AMIGA to assess the impacts of GM crops on the agro-ecosystems.  Dr. Ewen Mullins from Teagasc was a speaker at our 2013 conference, details of which I will outline presently.  He has updated the relevant slide.  Committee members can see the slide on the right, which shows the position after two years of planting.  On the left side members can see the devastation caused by the late potato blight fungus.  To combat this disease Irish farmers would have to use approximately 15 to 20 sprays of fungicide per year.  The slide on the right shows the GM plant.  It has a single gene from a wild potato.  I imagine committee members can see the potential of this technology.  Every picture tells a story, mar a deirtear.<\/p><p> The EPA has no remit for GM food and feed in Ireland and, therefore, the agency has no comment to make on this proposal.  However, I wish to inform the committee of some of the outcomes of a conference held by the EPA in 2013.  The outcomes are still pertinent to this day.  The aim of the conference was to emphasise the relevance and importance of GM technology to Irish research, industry and the economy.  An EPA report, \"Synopsis of issues arising from the conference - Regulation and Use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in technology in Ireland\" was sent electronically to all Members in January this year for information purposes.  No doubt all committee members have read the document.  I re-sent it to the committee last week in electronic form.<\/p><p> What were the main outcomes?  We had several international speakers from the European Food Safety Authority and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment in the United Kingdom.  From the United States we had an NGO speaker and we had a speaker from the IFA as well and so on.  I will summarise the main points.  It was evident that Irish farmers rely on the importation of animal feed derived from GM soya and corn.  In 2012 more than 50% of imported grain was derived from GM soya and GM maize.  In fact, the EU is only 35% sufficient in animal protein and the remainder must be imported.  This means approximately 1,800 million ha must be planted outside the European Union to provide vegetable protein, an incredible area of land.  Irish farmers were concerned that they might become less competitive because they had to pay a higher price for imported commodity crops.  This is still pertinent for the current proposal before the committee.<\/p><p> Another outcome of the conference was the evidence that the use of GM technology is helping to drive Ireland's exports.  GM technology has the propensity to create more jobs in the bio-pharma sector.  For the first time Irish researchers now have the capability to carry out clinical trials on patients in hospitals using GM vaccines and other medicinal products.  Basically, this derives from Government policies in recent years.  The money has been spent on research and much of this has now been transferred to hospitals to determine whether those vaccines or drugs have any efficacy.<\/p><p> Nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies are located in Ireland and this has created over 24,000 jobs.  Fully 50% of our exports derive from the life sciences, including the bio-pharma sector.  The sector is very important.  Many companies are moving away from chemical synthesis of drugs in favour of biologics.  This is more efficacious and environmentally friendly because the companies are not using chemicals.<\/p><p> A further outcome was the general agreement that the EU regulatory system pertaining to GM crops is cumbersome, expensive, not proportionate to the risks and not functioning properly for the workings of the Internal Market.  Already there is evidence that this dysfunctional regulatory system is responsible for bio-tech job losses in the European Union.  Two multinational companies have already given up on the EU regulatory regime for cultivation purposes.  In 2012, the German giant, BASF, announced that it had halted the development of commercialisation of GM crops in Europe and moved its bio-tech research and development operations lock, stock and barrel, including growth chambers, greenhouses and laboratories, to the United States.<\/p><p>The firm cited consumer and political resistance to transgenic plants or GM crops in Europe for its decision.  Two weeks ago I heard from my German colleagues that Bayer and KWS have moved from Germany over the past year and a half.  KWS is a more traditional plant breeding company and it moved half of its research and development facilities to the United States.  The German authorities did say they were very concerned about the potential for job losses.  <\/p><p> I will outline another conclusion.  There was a discussion on why Ireland should support a product and phenotype-based regulatory system, rather than the current process-based regulatory system.  It was felt the former might better serve EU farmers and SMEs.  Such an initiative would make sense, bearing in mind that there are herbicide tolerant crops in the EU at present that are unregulated even though they have the same potential concerns as their GM counterparts.  These conventional herbicide tolerant crops are now available to Irish farmers.  They are also called clearfield crops.  Basically, it means one can select herbicide tolerance using traditional plant breeding.  However, they have the same potential concerns with the fallout from the GMO regulations.  Canada uses a product-based regulatory which regulates everything, if one knows what I mean. <\/p><p> The word \"proportionality\" is key when it comes to the implementation of the GMO deliberate release directive 2001\/18\/EC.  It was the opinion of some of the speakers at the conference that the EU is overly concerned about the potential risks from using GM crops and is not sufficiently concerned about the environmental harm that invasive species do to ecosystems.  The two species of Gunnera or wild rhubarb and Japanese knotweed are a huge problem.  I have no doubt that they have caused environmental harm.  They have adversely affected biodiversity by affecting whole ecosystems and habitats, especially in some parts of the west of Ireland.  If one drives from Achill Island, which is my own part of the woods, up to Bangor Erris and south to Clifden, one will see that wild rhubarb has completely taken over ecosystems.  Japanese knotweed has done the same in Kerry, Wexford and other counties and is very dangerous.  Unfortunately, it appears that no one is doing anything to eradicate these invasive species.  Twenty years ago people were concerned that GM crops would be released into the ecosystem.  Ireland has a problem with invasive species and we seem to have taken our eye off the ball.<\/p><p> Another matter of paramount importance is how the new techniques for plant-breeding and the genetic modification of microbes will be regulated at EU level.  The relevant EU directives are 25 years old but GM technology has come on in leaps and bounds.  At present scientists can turn a gene on or off in a plant or microbe without the insertion of new DNA or protein in the plant.  The big question in Europe is how can we regulate such products.  If we regulate them as GMOs then other jurisdictions, such as the United States, will probably deregulate.  Such a scenario would leave SMEs in the European Union with huge concerns, as I alluded to previously.<\/p><p> It is likely that some of the new techniques currently under scrutiny will not be regulated as GMOs in other jurisdictions.  The product or phenotype-based regulatory system might overcome the problem of how to regulate the new techniques.  Changing to a product-based system would bring the EU regulatory system in line with our main trading partners and would not distort trade.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I hope I have given the committee an overview of GMO regulation in Ireland.

Genetic modification is an emerging theory which brings potential but also  limitations and dangers.  The use of GMOs is a concern for consumers.  It may not be the topic of many conversations but, ultimately, it will reflect in the foodstuffs that consumers eat, whether that is in the form of animals fed with GM processed foods or the GM processing or engineering of human foodstuffs.<\/p><p>There is a cultural dynamic at play here also.  As humans do we want to eat food that is natural and that comes from traditional agricultural methods or do we want to eat food that is engineered in some other way, through human, technological or biotechnological intervention?  This is the question for consumers.  While we can dress up the issue as providing the consumer with a choice, we must reflect on the cultural dynamic before moving on and saying that by providing GM foods, we are giving consumers a choice.<\/p><p> If we accept that argument, we are in some way giving in to the major companies, Monsanto and other global institutions, which are positioning themselves on the world stage to be larger than countries, by acquiring the possibility of feeding nations through genetically modified food and feedstuffs, whether for human or animal consumption, in the future.  This scares me.  I come from a food science background and am well aware of some of the research which has been carried out over the past 15 or 20 years by companies such as Monsanto.  I have friends who work in that sector, in biotechnology and elsewhere, who are making a healthy living from it.  However, what scares me is that we do not know where it is going to end.<\/p><p> Much research has been done in this area by PhD students and others, some of which has been positive and some negative.  The ship is out in regard to the future.  I agree there will be a huge global demand for food because of increasing populations.  How are we as policy makers to prepare to meet that demand?  Should we give in to the fact that multinational players can provide food or should we consider more conventional, traditional methods of providing food?  As a committee representing the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I presume we would promote the more traditional system of providing or developing foodstuffs first.  <\/p><p> I will now put some questions to the witnesses, in particular to the representatives from the Department.  Reference was made to the demand for genetically modified feedstuffs.  The last slide shown by Dr. McLoughlin showed that more than 50% of imported grain here is derived from GM soya and GM maize products.  Is that the case?  To what extent do our feed and grain manufacturing plants use GM sourced raw materials currently?  In the eyes of the Department, what is the current situation and what does it expect it to be in future, taking on board the available agricultural land here?  What efforts are being made to try to promote and protect our traditional farming, grain and tillage farmers, in developing their enterprises rather than import grain?  Has the Department considered doing this?  What is the position regarding issues such as the environment, health, ethics and declining rural areas versus the importation of GM sourced grain?  These are just general questions.<\/p><p> In regard to the European proposals, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health seem to have taken the view that the proposals are somewhat prohibitive.  Is that due to the fact that they are predominantly more process specific than product specific and that countries have difficulties in opting out?<\/p><p>Article 34 states:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>member states may adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use of products referred to in Article 3(1) and 15(1) authorised pursuant to this Regulation provided that such measures are:<br \/><br \/>(a) reasoned and based on compelling grounds in accordance with Union law which shall, in no case, conflict with the risk assessment carried out pursuant this Regulation;<br \/><br \/>(b) proportional and non-discriminatory.<\/blockquote>I presume if both Departments are not accepting where the Commission is coming from, submissions have been made to the Commission.  Has either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine raised a concern at Council level ?  What has been the level of dialogue?  Is there a view within the Department of Health on health implications of genetically modified sources or processed foodstuffs coming into the human food chain in Ireland?  Ultimately, it will end in the human food chain if we are sourcing raw material to be fed to animals.  What is the view of the Department of Health on some of the conflicting research material, both within Europe and the United States, with respect to the implications for human health from that?<br\/><br\/>These are a few general points but it is a large and evolving area.  It is a financially lucrative area, which worries me.  While accepting that we need genetically modified foods to feed our animals in this country because we are not self-sufficient in Europe or Ireland, we are only providing ourselves with one option.  Have other options been considered, such as helping our own grain farmers and industry to develop?  I touched on what Ministers have done at Council level as I would like to know what has been happening there.<br\/><br\/>A proposal came before us at the last committee, COM 2015\/0093, but has there been any initial feedback from the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Commission on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#P00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their contributions today.  Like many citizens, I share concerns about this at the outset.  There are two aspects, with the first being the safety of genetically modified produce, while the crucial issue is the motivation behind many of the main producers of genetically modified foods.  When we consider the five countries involved - the United States, Canada, India, Argentina and Brazil - and the companies, such as Monsanto, as named by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, with a control factor, the food chain of the world could be in the hands of a few people.  That may be the motivation.  The consequences for generations to come could be startling.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health is responsible for examining the use of genetically modified organisms for food purposes.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for examining the import and use of genetically modified feed and the control measures for cultivation post-commercialisation if that arises.<\/p><p>Is there joined-up thinking?  Is there a forum whereby there is a linkage between the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the safety aspect of it?<\/p><p> On cross contamination, trials have been carried out in this country on growing GM produce alongside the natural production of food with regard to cross contamination, the effects of it and how it affects the natural produce.  What is the percentage of the contamination as a consequence of that?  I believe Spain produces 90% of GM production in Europe.  Again, we are talking about very low income economies being very vulnerable to being, perhaps, exploited for that purpose.  Also, there is the fact that climate would be a factor, because Portugal is one of the bigger producers as well.  There is also Romania and the Czech Republic.  Countries such as Germany, France and the more affluent countries of the European Union have severe restrictions on it.  That poses a question.  Abuse is probably the wrong word, but the weaker and more vulnerable economies are being used for production and perhaps being exploited for that purpose.<\/p><p> With regard to unauthorised GM crops, is there any mechanism to prevent them finding their way into what is described as the authorised sector?  We saw what happened across Europe when there was the scandal last year with horse meat in the various different chains and how easily that could be done.<\/p><p> Regarding the tests being carried out by the European Food Safety Authority and so forth, who carries out those tests on behalf of the food safety authority?  Who has the contract for doing that?  Who pays for it?  If companies are carrying out tests on behalf of a food safety authority, there is the issue of the bona fides of the people who carry them out.  Where does the funding for it come from?  Is it paid for by the European taxpayer?  Do any contributions come from the sector itself, such as the big production companies in GM production?  Again, with regard to the safety point of view, can the Department of Health representatives, in particular, say in absolute terms that they are quite satisfied with the safety of that food, be it in the food chain or the feed chain?  The fact that it is in the feed chain automatically means it finds its way into the food chain because we are eating it.  Will they give their views on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#R00200","speaker":"1047","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  It is hard to know where to start with this except to be direct in my approach.  I have severe reservations about genetically modified material for a number of reasons.  I qualified as a biochemist and at that stage, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the human genome was sequenced.  I did a PhD on homology modelling, which was something similar to what we are considering here.  When one talks about the genome people get the impression that it is one straight line of sequences, but it comes together in a three dimensional model.  The issue I have is that when we tamper with sequences at one part of the genome it could touch, promote, start or do something with the sequences on the other end, which are far away from each other but come close together in three dimensional structure.<\/p><p> We know the potential of virus sequences, which are short, but there are many sequences which, because we do not know what they can do, are redundant.  While GM enables us to identify and put in traces that are beneficial we could at some stage, because we do not fully understand it, open up something that we do not want to open up.  The point I am trying to make is that we are not long into GM in terms of the polymerase train reaction having been only developed in the 1980s.  While there are many advantages to GM we need to be cautious to a certain extent.<\/p><p> In regard to the statement that we must not conflict with the EFSA's risk assessment, if we cannot conflict with its risk assessment are we not then operating with one arm behind our back?  It was also stated that GMO is as \"safe\" as conventional use but, by way of illustration, there were many statements made a couple of years ago to the effect that our banks were fully capitalised.  One cannot enter into something by putting down constants that may not be correct.  In regard to the availability of GM crops on which glycocate can be sprayed, the argument has been made by many people that glycocate, or roundup as it is often called, if used on soil for long periods ruins the structure of the soil.  I am a farmer.  I would use glycocate only sparingly bearing in mind soil structure.  <\/p><p> Reference was made to labelling.  We cannot even get our country of origin labelling right.  I would suggest that we get that labelling right before entering into this area.  Another statement made earlier is that experts in the EFSA carry out a risk assessment of the data presented.  Is the EFSA provided with all or only part of the data?  <\/p><p> Reference was also made to trade difficulties.  I am a tillage farmer.  The current difficulty for the tillage industry is the recent production of three of the largest ever world harvests, as a result of which farmers are going out of business.  The price of grain today is lower than it was 25 years ago.  There will be no need to worry about grain production in Ireland into the future if this continues.  That is a sad fact.  Tillage farmers in Ireland are relying on high yields to survive.  Only for the single farm payment many tillage farmers would be gone out of business.  That is the reality of grain production in Ireland.  In regard to the suggestion that we achieve higher yields to ensure lower prices, in a country like Ireland higher world production will put us at the mercy of importers and out of business.  <\/p><p> It was also stated that the EU is only 35% self sufficient in proteins.  Thankfully, following negotiations on the new single farm payment, a supplement of &euro;100 per acre is now being paid in respect of crops such as beans.  For the first time ever, I now grow beans and protein crops and will continue to do so.  Perhaps we should put more effort into growing protein crops in the EU rather than looking to America and other areas to supply us with GM products.  If we could manage to produce enough protein what is being proposed would be worthy of consideration.  Currently, no effort is being made to protect our tillage industry.  No effort is being made to make us different.  We cannot compete on scale but we can compete on quality.  We are about to accept the potential GM argument without first doing everything we can to increase protein production within the EU.  <\/p><p> It was also stated that member states must be able to justify prohibition on the grounds of overriding public interest, in respect of which five grounds are listed.  In my view, this restricts individual states' ability to object to GM foods if they have a concern.  I do not like the headlong rush into this.  The submission from the Department of Health ended with the following: \"The Department of Health's view is that the provisions of the legislation currently in place for GM feeds provide adequate science-based safeguards\".  I am not convinced the safeguards we have in place are adequate.<\/p><p> With regard to the EPA presentation, I agree that our biopharm industry is very valuable.<\/p><p>I do not have a difficulty with that.  It was stated that Irish farmers are concerned that they might become less competitive.  As matters stand, we are already less competitive.  Once one is losing money, it all becomes relative.  I do not believe that growing GM crops will lead to tillage farmers being any better off.  As a tillage farmer, I am of the view that the position will be quite the opposite.<\/p><p> In the context of proportionality, there appears to be a headlong rush into GM production.  Reference was made to potatoes and I am aware of the fabulous work being done at Oak Park.  However, it must be remembered that three or four years ago we were lucky to be in a position to export potatoes because there were just too many of them being grown here.  I would have welcomed it if representatives from the pesticide control service had been invited to appear before us today.  That service does great work and I would have liked to have heard its view on this matter.  In a nutshell, we like the country to be perceived as having a green image.  If the US and other countries throughout the world had segregated GM crops, there would be no problem.  What would be the position if we presented those who buy food for their families a distinct choice between whether they would prefer to buy a bag of regular potatoes or a bag of clearly labelled GM potatoes?  The concern that arises - be it right or wrong - is that people would go for the safer option.  We must be very careful in the context of rushing headlong into promoting GM production.  I remain of the view that there are still health concerns but I am willing to be persuaded - over time - that this is not the case.  I will only be convinced when we have a proper understanding of the science involved.<\/p><p> From a purely business point of view, increased world production will mean that there will be no cereal industry left in this country.  Our cereal industry is dying on its feet at present.  I am of the view, therefore, that Europe should be seeking to produce more and more protein in order to give us something which we badly need.  There was a fodder crisis in this country a number of years ago, which related to the fact that we were in expansion mode rather than that we were running out of protein.  The price of soya remains quite high and people have been complaining about that fact.  Perhaps by ensuring that we have an industry in this country, we can protect our selves from the vagaries of the markets in this regard.  It must be remembered that speculation in respect of cereals - including proteins - is what adds vastly to the price in many cases.  However, I accept that political instability also plays a part.  Those are my views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#S00200","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for coming before us and sharing their expertise.  This is an emotive issue and it is the use of the word \"modified\" that frightens people.  Genetics have been use for some time in the context of the development of crops and animals.  In the context of human health, superbugs have emerged against which existing antibiotics are useless.  As a result, new antibiotics have had to be developed and this has been achieved by means of modification.<\/p> <p>  We must ask whether there is a need for GM crops.  I am here to be enlightened and persuaded in that regard.  Will our guests indicate whether the world's population can be fed without the use of GM crops?  It was stated that we import 66% of the protein feeds we require for our animals.  Deputy Barry made the point that the price of crops in Ireland is being forced down as a result of the fact that other countries are in a position to produce GM crops.  In circumstances where existing regulations do not allow GM crops to be grown in a particular country, are the people who live there being placed at an unfair disadvantage?  Technically, it should be cheaper to produce a GM crop as a result of the need to use fewer pesticides, to engage in less husbandry, etc.  Under COM (2015) 177, it will be left to member states to decide whether they wish to allow the use of GM products.<\/p><p>I would welcome the views of the panel on whether the use of such products should be regulated by individual member states?  In such circumstances, the interpretation of regulation on the use of these products would be very open-ended.  <\/p><p> Reference was made in the EPA presentation to herbicide-tolerant, HT, and to GM.  Does herbicide-tolerant not technically also mean genetically modified in some way?  As I said earlier, in terms of food production, particular breeds of animals are being constantly improved through genetics, as are crops.  Years ago the only barley available on the market here was midas barley, in respect of which one got approximately a tonne and half per acre.  We now also have hybrid crops, such as spring barley, which is a genetically modified food, in respect of which production is approximately three to three and a half tonnes per acre.  Can the world survive without GM crops?  If not, should member states have the right to regulate on the introduction of such crops in their country?<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Barry's remarks in regard to GM on all food products.  Technically, beef produced here and enhanced through the use of imported protein, which is genetically modified, should be labelled as such.  Would that affect our green image and our standing as the best country in the world in terms of food traceability?  As I said, genetics results in better breeding.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the major players in this area, including the US, Canada, Argentina and Brazil.  It was also stated that Spain produces 90% of the GM maize MON81-10 produced in the EU.  Is that product exported from the EU or is it used in Spain in the production of feedlots and so on?  As I said, this is an emotive topic.  We are all aware of the many multinationals that engaged in trials in this area and were destroyed.  It is important all research in this area is completed and then made available to the public so that people can make up their own minds.  In my view, labelling in this regard is the way forward.  As I said, I am here to be persuaded.  I believe GM has a future in the world because I do not believe we will be able to feed the world population without additional production, which into the future will require genetically modified foods.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015060900002#U00200","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433854800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry has spoken about many of the issues on which I had intended to focus.  I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations, which were illuminating as well as informative.  I thank them for the effort they put into their presentations.<\/p> <p>  I have many reservations and bountiful scepticism about GMO based food and food crops.  I always believe that when dabbling with the unknown one must err on the side of caution.  Deputy Barry used his technical knowledge to outline what can happen when one intervenes in sequences and so on.  In such circumstances, one never knows what the outcome will be, which is a matter of great concern.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry is correct that the reason poor grain is being imported is profitability and that but for the single farm payment most grain farmers would be wiped out altogether.  Approximately 3 million tonnes of animal feed material is imported into Ireland each year.  More than 50% of this grain is derived from GM soya and GM maize.  Does anybody ever refer to this?<\/p><p> We talk about food labelling.  Is that referred to in any way in the context of labelling, given that a significant amount of feedstuffs for cattle and livestock already contains significant amounts of GM ingredients?  Where is that?  My colleague is right.  Trying to get the label of origin here has been something that defeated the European Commission.  Even though we have a new EU Commissioner I have no doubt that, regardless of how hard he tries, there will be obstacles in that regard.<\/p><p> We have received submissions from various groups saying that there were 17 varieties caught up in the system in the last Commission and that it is an incredible failure of the EU's GMO regulations and a disregard for the scientific opinion of the EFSA.  However, one must be very careful of opinions.  Is everything independent or is there a mad rush by strongly financed, muscular and well heeled companies because it is in their interests to promote this?  We must be very careful as one can throw out the baby with the bath water with respect to always trying to advance technology.  For whose benefit will it ultimately be?<\/p><p> Senator O'Neill asked a relevant question regarding where this fits into feeding the world's population.  It is an interesting question that somebody should try to address.  Is this what it is about or is there a different motive altogether?  A financial motive might well be driving this.<\/p><p> I have grave reservations, but this is a useful forum for the information being imparted by the witnesses today.  I remain sceptical and I would be difficult to persuade as to the merits, particularly given the rush.  We must know more and we must tread carefully before a final decision is made in this country.  Regarding our voting record at Commission level, how do we vote?  Do we vote in accordance with the science or do we make up our own minds?  What are the criteria that drive us to make our decisions?  Are they made on an individual basis or do we have a bloc view on this going forward?  Is it a policy view or is it individual?  It is important to know that as well.

To be clear, the proposal we are dealing with is to allow the individual member states to nationalise their decision on approved products that are GMO feeds for animal feed that are approved by the EFSA in the first instance.  We must be clear on what this COM is about.  There is a wider argument, but it does not have anything to do with products for the health or biopharma sectors, even though there are many in that area.  It strictly relates to feed of greater than 0.9%.  The fear from the IGFA, as I see it, is that it would un-level the playing field for member states if some states or administrations of the day might have a more restrictive approach to it than others.<\/p> <p>  It is inevitable that it will lead to more questions, as members have mentioned here, about any effort on the part of the EU to produce more proteins for animal feeds, non-GM proteins, in crop rotations and everything else.  It is inevitable that the discussion would go that way.

Ireland imports at total of 3 million tonnes of feed materials approximately per annum, of which 1.2 millions or 40% is made up of GM feed materials - soya bean and maize by-products, which are distiiller's dried grains and corn gluten.  The protein content of soya bean is more than 40% and the protein content of the other products is more than 20%.  These materials are used specifically to bolster the protein content of compound feeds.  The soya bean is particularly important for pigs and poultry.  One cannot use the distiller's dried grains or the corn gluten and, therefore, the pig and poultry industry is dependent on the soya bean.  That is a European wide situation regarding pigs and poultry.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the cultivation of alternative crops, as has been mentioned, there is a financial incentive of &euro;250 per hectare to grow beans, peas and sweet lupins.  A number of feed compounders are geared up to process those products.  They can be used to varying extents in the diets of animals.  Peas can be used for pigs and poultry and beans and lupins can be used for dairy cattle.<\/p><p>Of course, the relative use of those protein supplements versus soya bean, corn gluten or distillers grains always is a cost factor.  There is another issue of the quantity of peas and beans that one can grow in Ireland, given the harvest conditions and given the soil conditions that are required.  I believe that deals with the aspect the Senator raised in this regard.<\/p><p> The Senator asked a question about any submissions that might have been made at this stage.  This current proposal is relatively new and only came out on 22 April.  It will come before the Council next week and that will be the first stage.  It also will come before the European Parliament next week.  Following on from that level, the procedure is that it will go down to a working group from the Council and it will go down to a rapporteur from the Parliament.  We will then be in a co-decision process, which will come later on.  If one likes, it is a rather long process and at this stage, and we are only at the very start of it.  We already have received the views of the Irish Grain and Feed Association which has made clear its views on this proposal.  Obviously, our Department will be interested in the views of this joint committee when members finish their deliberations.  At present, we are at the early stages.

This is a relatively small proposal, but its brevity does not mean simplicity.  It will have to be worked through.  Eventually the Council will reach an agreed position through negotiations.  It will pass from the Council working party to the group of permanent representatives of member states who will decide whether they have reached an agreed position that can be put to Ministers.

Over 90% of the soya bean cultivated in the USA, Brazil and Argentina is genetically modified.  The option of sourcing non-genetically modified soya bean from there is not available.  In addition, the amount of soya bean grown within the European Union at the moment is relatively small.  It is mainly grown in Italy, Hungary, France, Austria and one or two other countries.  They utilise all the soya bean that they grow themselves.  In the case of the pig, poultry and high-performance dairy herds, there is no option to replace that protein with any other protein source because there is only a given supply of oil seed rape or beans, to which Deputy Barry referred.  Beans are an excellent protein source for ruminants, particularly for beef cattle etc.  However, it is not of the same quality of protein as soya bean.

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the matter of bio-safety research.  Over a 25 year period the EU has spent &euro;300 million of taxpayers' money looking at bio-safety research in respect of food safety, environmental safety and safety in laboratories.  The research was published in 2010 by the then Commissioner, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Some of this research was carried out by universities in Ireland.  It was all independent research.  The results showed that GM technologies <i>per se<\/i>are no more dangerous than conventional crop breeding.<br\/><br\/>Another point was raised in respect of field trials and gene flow.  We had a number of field trials with herbicide-tolerant sugar beets in the 1990s.<\/p><p>The EPA looked very closely at the results in subsequent years when the sugar beet was planted.  We did not see the emergence of any tolerance to related weed species.  Unfortunately, we have no sugar beet industry now.<br\/><br\/>The current Teagasc trial is looking at indicators for biodiversity.  Again, this particular trial is funded by EU taxpayers.  The trial is comparing different types of management, i.e. integrated pest management.  It is also looking at Sarpo Mira, a naturally tolerant potato variety, compared to GM and non-GM varieties.  The results will come out in 2016 or around that time.  Of course, that gene came from a potato.  It was what is called a cisgenic potato.<br\/><br\/>A committee member asked whether this was new.  GM technology has been occurring for thousands of years.  I am referring to genetic modification <i>per se<\/i>in plants and animals.  Let us consider the wheat crop we have today.  It is not comparable to the wheat crop from 100 years ago, for example.  Again, there is intervention by plant breeders and the use of technologies like chemical mutagenesis.  As I mentioned, I believe these new techniques will circumvent the acronym GMO.  This is because we will not be able to differentiate between whether the resulting apple from an apple tree will have any new trait.  There will be no new DNA protein because of how the technology has moved.<br\/><br\/>Someone mentioned feeding the world.  Certainly, we need every tool in the toolbox.  We are experiencing climate change.  Certain pathogens are emerging in Ireland, including Schmallenberg, the virus that effects abortion in sheep.  That came in approximately ten years ago.  There is also ash dieback disease.  Can we actually manage without this technology?  Let us consider what has happened with the Ebola virus and how it was treated.  It was by using GM technology in Sierra Leone.  We need to look very carefully at it.

Mr. Lohan mentioned that we do not have alternatives for protein at present, and he is correct.  We met the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine one year ago.

Whatever price we wanted to throw at it, we could not get it.  There was a necessity that we should look long-term at increasing our production of protein.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lohan is correct.  The essential amino acids in soyas are better than in beans.  I was in Hungary last week as part of an Oireachtas delegation.  Those we spoke to shared many of the concerns we have.  They are not fans of GM produce.  They are concerned although they might be persuaded in future, like all of us.  It struck me that in the long term we should consider encouraging the profitable production of the likes of soya in countries where it can be done GM-free.  We would produce far more beans in this country if we were encouraged to do it.  It is very easy and the market will follow it.  If farmers believe there is profitability in a crop, they will grow it well.  Some parts of Europe could produce it.  All I am saying is that in the long term we should look for the possibility that we could have certain production without GM technology if it is perceived among the people who buy our products that they would prefer to have non-GM products.  At the moment there is such a mixed bag that we cannot make out what is what in respect of what is coming over on ships.  We are feeding GM crops.  What is the view of the delegation?

I will go through the presentation we have provided.  The first slide I want to mention relates to the challenges the company faces.  Bord na M&oacute;na currently faces a number of challenges forcing it to transform and diversify.  The first of these relates to Edenderry Power Limited, EPL, our power station in Edenderry, that is currently up for a judicial review which has delayed us achieving planning permission.  Historically, this station has been a 100% peat burning station but it is now a co-fired biomass-peat station.  In the future, this station will co-fire 37% biomass and 63% peat.  This creates both a challenge and an opportunity in the realm of biomass, an issue I will deal with shortly.<\/p> <p>  In view of the scale of the transformations required, we are currently engaged in a detailed LRC review process with the unions.  We have a total of 11 issues before the LRC and, where possible, I will explain what is involved in that process.  The carbon tax has had a severe impact on our fuel business.  Bord na M&oacute;na is the largest solid fuel company in Ireland and revenue from the fuel division is currently approximately &euro;107 million.  We have a significant market share on coal and on briquettes and the carbon tax in the two tranches that have come in have left us in an uncompetitive position, mainly driven by the enforcement of the carbon tax on a level playing field.  Last year, we paid &euro;8.7 million in carbon tax, 51% of the total carbon tax take of &euro;17.2 million, but we only have a 30% share of that market.  This is affecting our ability to sell our solid fuel products.<\/p> <p>  We have significant competition in all our divisions, but the division under the most pressure is the fuel business.  I will touch on that shortly.  Biomass offers a significant opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na.  We have had successful discussions with the ESB in regard to keeping the three peat-fired stations running post-2019 when the fuel purchase agreements and the PSO support run out.  I have worked very closely with the CEO of the ESB and we were able to announce this development to our workforce in the past month.<\/p><p>That creates an opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na with biomass supply and we will need approximately 1.2 million tonnes of biomass to supply those three stations plus a significant amount of other biomass for other businesses.  I will touch on that shortly.<\/p><p> To do that, the whole business needs to transform, and we are really in the middle of that now.  We must take down our cost-base significantly with peat production to allow us to compete on the open market with a commodity fuel, such as coal, oil and gas.  Up to now we have had guaranteed pricing under our fuel purchase agreements.  The one at Edenderry, EPL, ceases on 21 December and the agreement at the two ESB stations finishes at the end of 2019.  We must reduce our cost base significantly to allow those stations to continue to co-fire on a commercial basis.<\/p><p> That is a summary of the challenges facing the business.  The backbone of our strategic plan is to remain a major employer in the midlands.  Bord na M&oacute;na employs approximately 2,200 people today and we believe we have developed a plan that will continue to sustain that level of employment in the region up to 2030 and beyond.  We want to become the number one renewable energy supplier in Ireland.  We believe we can do that because of the land bank we have, and we have already invested significantly in wind farms.  We have three wind farms in operation, including two major investments that came on-stream last year, in Mount Lucas and Bruckana.  We also want to become the number one renewable home heating supplier in Ireland and the UK, and I will touch upon that in a few moments.  The position of number one landfill operator will become a strategic asset to the State, as a large number of landfills have closed over the past number of years.  We will still need landfill going forward for items that cannot be disposed of in incinerators.  I will speak to that more when we get to resource recovery.  The aspiration to be the number one biomass supplier is an Ireland Inc. opportunity for Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, and I will touch on that later in the presentation.<\/p><p> Going back to Bord na M&oacute;na's roots in growing media, we have a number one position in Ireland and the UK on growing media and we are developing a professional horticultural product on a global basis.  I was fortunate enough to visit customers in Holland, Germany and Belgium last month, and Irish peat is regarded as the premier brand in the world.  It is a matter of how we get that brand to market.  Feedstock consists of all our peat harvesting, with peat used as energy in the three power stations and approximately 500,000 tonnes used in briquette factories.  It is also used in our horticulture business.  I have spoken about the challenges and the transformation solution, as spoken of in recent days, means we have to take &euro;24.2 million per annum from the cost of the business.  That should allow us to maintain the current employment level out to 2030 and beyond.<\/p><p> For the future, as a major employer in the midlands we believe we can transform Bord na M&oacute;na by 2030 into a significant producer of biomass as the peat reduces and peat energy runs out.  We believe we can sustain up to approximately 1,000 jobs in that biomass industry over the next decade.  We already have a skill-set and we have the largest tractor and excavator fleet in Europe.  Our employees are used to those skills and the transition, if we can get buy-in from the farming community, will allow Bord na M&oacute;na to be a major employer in the biomass industry.  The main component of this industry will be around willow and the mobilisation of the private forestry sector.  We have approximately 650 acres currently contracted under willow and that is yielding far in excess of our expectations in terms of tonnes per acre.  We have a financial proposition that will be attractive to farmers.  We have sent a package to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding our proposals to establish willow on a level footing with forestry, and we are hoping to get that included in this year's budget.<\/p><p> The other opportunity for us in biomass is the mobilisation of the private forestry sector.  We have had &euro;2.3 billion invested in private forestry grants since 1980, and private forestry is now becoming available for harvesting.  Very little has been done to date and through the Government initiative on BioEnergy, Ireland with Coillte, and with the addition of strategic partners, we believe we can grow that to approximately 500,000 tonnes by 2020 and 1 million tonnes of biomass by the middle of the next decade.<\/p><p>It will have a significant labour requirement, but we believe our current workforce engaged in peat harvesting is very capable of taking up the role.<\/p><p> We have two briquette factories in Derrinlough and Littleton.  Unfortunately, these factories are on an extended lay-off this year owing to a number of factors related to the carbon tax which we have mentioned, the fact that we had a very mild winter and that large stocks were available at the end of the production season.  However, we believe that with new products coming on stream, including a biomass briquette which will be 50% peat and 50% wood-based, there is a long-term future for these plants.  We hope to invest in two CHP plants, one in Littleton and one in Derrinlough, to replace existing infrastructure as a sign of our commitment.  We are also considering a new ovoid facility and will be seeking planning permission in Foynes later this month to get ready for the smokey coal ban if and when it is eventually imposed.  The facility will be capable of producing 200,000 tonnes of smokeless ovoid to replace bituminous coal.<\/p><p> On the horticulture side, we have two revenue streams through retail growing media and professional growing media.  Retail growing media are products used, for example, in Co Op stores, B&amp;Q and so forth, while professional growing media are high-end peat products used for professional growing, particularly in Holland and France.  They are large-scale specialist growers.  On the retail side, we are a major supplier both in Ireland and the United Kingdom, while on the professional side, there will be an opportunity into the future to develop our professional brand on a global basis.  It is not a skills set we possess, but the board has approved investment in it to allow us to develop the brand globally.<\/p><p> In terms of future investment, we must upgrade our existing facilities.  We must also invest in new professional bogs.  An energy peat bog is not the same as a professional horticulture bog.  We are examining our bank of peat to see which bogs we can develop to allow us to grow our professional business.<\/p><p> With regard to our renewable energy strategy, in 2014, for the first year ever, we produced more power from renewable energy resources than from traditional fossil fuels.  A total of 52% of our output came from renewable energy resources.  We have three wind farms and EPL which is co-firing at a figure of just over 30%.  We also use landfill gas on our Drehid site to generate power for approximately 8,000 homes.  It is our intention to invest in one wind farm per year for seven years, primarily on our own land.  I can discuss that matter further.  We are also ideally placed to capitalise on any roll-out of solar energy projects, for which our land is ideally suited.  When peat harvesting is exhausted, we will be left with a relatively flat land bank, with no vegetation, in remote areas.  We can roll out large-scale solar farms on this land.  I am pleased to announce that we will have a pilot 30 acre solar farm next year at Mount Lucas which will be capable of generating 5 MW.  Our plan in the longer term for wind farms is to co-locate solar and wind energy projects in order that during the summer when the wind is light we will maximise our output from our solar facility.  Our plan on the renewable energy side is to become a portfolio player by 2030.  We also believe we have a pivotal role to play in storage as the technology develops.  The ideal scenario for our land bank is that we will end up with wind farms co-located with solar and battery array facilities in order that we can take away the variability in renewable energy output.<\/p><p> On the resource recovery aspect, we have a very significant site in Drehid of 6,500 acres, with planning permission to 2028.  We have a number of facilities on site - landfill, landfill gas and a compost facility.  Our current capital programme will allow us to invest there.  We have planning permission for a 250,000 tonne MBT facility and are in the very early stages of looking at a gasification plant that will generate 15 MW of electricity.<\/p><p>The picture to the left of the slide is the MBT facility and to the right is the 15 MW power station.  A fuel derived from the MBT facility will be passed via conveyor into the gasification plant to generate the electricity.<\/p><p> Another possible major project for the Drehid facility is ash recovery and treatment.  This would involve us taking ash from the Covanta and Indaver incinerators and processing that ash to reclaim metals, with further treatment to allow it to be used in aggregates etc.  Once Covanta comes on stream, 220,000 tonnes per annum of ash will be processed between the two current incinerators in Ireland.<\/p><p> On land and community, which was our original mandate from the State, we have a significant land asset, with 80,000 hectares now in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  As per Government policy, we are working actively with Coillte on a number of work streams, including wind, BioEnergy Ireland, tourism and legal and shared services.  We believe there are significant opportunities, particularly in the tourism sector, to grow our relationship with Coillte.  Prior to applying for planning permission for any of this large-scale infrastructure, we engage with local communities to ensure there is clarity on all issues in order that we have their support before progressing.<\/p><p> From an employment perspective, as I mentioned earlier, Bord na M&oacute;na is a major employer, with 2,200 people spread across four divisions, soon to be five in terms of the division of the horticulture and fuels business.  We will only operate in those five divisions because they are our core businesses.  We believe we have developed a plan that will secure significant employment out to 2030, when we hope to be a different company, having replaced our peat business with large-scale biomass production.<\/p><p> In terms of our main requirements for the future, the first priority for us was to get the ESB agreement, which we have successfully done.  Keeping those power stations open is crucial to the future of employment in the midlands.  The two ESB stations support almost 1,000 jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na and the region.  Transformation is key.  We have to deliver savings of &euro;24.2 million if the ESB and EPL stations are to operate on a commercial basis.  There are many new business development opportunities within Bord na M&oacute;na.  If we deliver what we have outlined in our strategic plan, Bord na M&oacute;na revenue will grow from approximately &euro;430 million to approximately &euro;700 million over the next five to seven years.  This should ensure Bord na M&oacute;na remains a major employer in the midlands to 2030.  I thank the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn for his presentation.

The role of Bord na M&oacute;na in terms of employment in the midlands counties for decades has been significant.  Regardless of where we come from, we all want to see that continue into the future.  We all very much welcome the diversification of Bord na M&oacute;na and the forward planning outlined by Mr. Quinn.<\/p> <p>  In terms of jobs, at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications attended by Mr. Quinn, he stated Bord na M&oacute;na needed to achieve savings of &euro;24 million.  Will that target, which is pretty steep, be achieved and, if so, how will that impact on existing staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#J00400","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>We have to achieve the &euro;24.2 million.  I will explain why it is necessary that we achieve those savings.  The price of energy is linked to gas, the price of which has dropped significantly over the past three or four years.  Other fuel types include coal, which has decreased from $130 in 2011 to $60 a tonne now, and oil.  We are all aware what has happened to oil.  At the end of this year the Edenderry facility will have to be able to compete with those commodity fuel stocks on the open market.  If we do not get the peat price down to compete with those, we do not get access to the grid, which means we do not generate power.<\/p><p>That same scenario happens with the two ESB stations at the end of 2019.  While there has been all this movement in the commodity fuel-feedstocks, peat has been guaranteed at a fixed price for the past 15 years under these fuel purchase agreements supported by the PSO but that will end and, therefore, we have to transform our business to drive our feedstock business to compete against these other fuel commodities.<\/p><p> Will we achieve the savings?  We have to.  The three stations will become what is called co-fired stations.  Each of the three stations will operate between 37% and 40% biomass and, therefore, the need for peat will drop by 40% across the stations.  We need to a drop of 200 people in employment across the business to do that.  We are in a fortunate position in that we will have 216 natural retirees over the period to 2020 and, therefore, if there are redundances, it will be a handful.  However, we also see an opportunity on the biomass side to grow employment in the sector.  We spent &euro;19 million on biomass last year.  That will grow to more than &euro;100 million by 2020 and we believe that will increase to between &euro;175 million and &euro;200 million by 2025.  That will generate a significant opportunity for the workforce if we can get the willow crops, for example, off the ground.  We are also exploring another scenario.  Our peat harvesting business is seasonal, running from May to September, but we are talking to a company at the moment which would take the workforce and deploy it in the private forestry sector during the six months of the winter timeframe.

We were asked to examine the suitability of Bord na M&oacute;na land for anaerobic digestion, which we have done.  When one considers the position of Ireland versus, for example, Germany, where large-scale anaerobic digestion is used to produce biogas, it is obvious that the biggest problem we face arises in the context of the tariff.  We currently have the lowest tariff for anaerobic digestion in Europe.  The two challenges we face relate to the fact that we cannot make the use of digesters commercially viable and our ability to secure feedstock.  We have prepared a submission on the matter which we are going to send to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the next week or so.  We are of the view that there is scope for three regional anaerobic digesters of significant scale that would process somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of waste per annum in order to generate biogas but the provision of meaningful tariff support would be required to facilitate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Would Bord na M&oacute;na be in favour of changing the tariff in order to favour anaerobic digestion over wind energy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#L00700","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>They are two very different technologies.

We have a number of projects that have been ongoing for many years regarding the rehabilitation and restoration of peatlands.  In particular, in a very large area in excess of 5,000 acres of our peatlands in north-west Mayo, we have the largest rehabilitation and restoration project regarding peatland habitats in Europe.

The carbon tax has not been implemented by the Northern Ireland Executive, even though it has been introduced throughout the rest of the UK.  Mr. Quinn has already clearly outlined the impact that is having.  It should be implemented in the North of Ireland to provide a level playing field.<\/p> <p>  A major reason for insufficient biomass being grown here is that the land is being utilised for other more valuable crops.  It is likely that Bord na M&oacute;na will import more given that it is cheaper to import it and it has a lower moisture content than the biomass produced here.<\/p><p>How will does Bord na M&oacute;na encourage more farmers to produce willow, in particular?  How can the Government assist in that regard?  I am enthusiastic about the proposal to use the Mount Lucas site for solar energy generation.  If the solar panels prove successful, will Bord na M&oacute;na be more interested in developing solar capacity than wind turbines on its lands?  What can the Government do to encourage solar generation?  As far as I am concerned, the mix has gone too far towards wind.  With regard to the Mount Lucas project, what percentage of the turbines are not in use because other sources of energy are available on the grid?  Will the witnesses identify the locations of proposed wind farms over the next seven years?  I am concerned about a proposal for large-scale development close to a large property owned by Bord na M&oacute;na.  In the event of a connection being made to the grid, is it likely that the company will take advantage of the connection?  Is the area to which I refer being considered for a wind farm?<\/p><p> I asked earlier about the change in tariff from wind to biodigesters but I got an non-committal answer.  We should increase the tariffs for biodigesters but rather than levy the citizens of this State, perhaps we should reduce the tariff on other sources of energy generated from renewables.<\/p><p> The witnesses referred to Drehid, which is in the heart of my constituency.  I acknowledge that a community levy is imposed on each tonne going into the site but how many groups are involved and is there engagement with the local community in terms of showing people around the facility?  That is a better type of community interaction than simply paying a levy to the local authority for redistribution to the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#N01800","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Perhaps we can allow the witnesses to answer Deputy Lawlor's questions now before the Deputy asks further questions, if that is agreeable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#O00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I will have a few more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#O00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>It is more economical for us to use domestically produced biomass than to import materials.  We have given a commitment under NewERA that for every tonne of domestically produced biomass we will displace an imported tonne.  Biomass has become an internationally traded commodity which means that ownership of an international biomass supply chain is a low-risk venture because if we do not consume the material in Ireland, we can sell it on the open market.  A considerable number of economies are converting to biomass power stations and combined heat and power plants for district heating and other purposes.<\/p> <p>  The most recent energy crop programme involved miscanthus but it was a disaster.  Farmers have long memories of it.  We have been trying to get the willow programme off the ground for nearly five years but the fruit of our efforts is 650 acres, which is very disappointing.  The other problem is that while willow needs to be grown on good land, there is a lack of willingness on the part of the farming community to lock up land for 15 to 20 years.  We can, however, offer 15 to 20-year contracts for the willow because the power stations will need biomass over that period.  I hope that will go some way towards encouraging cultivation.  We have also been working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to prepare a grant package.  When one plants willow, there is no cashflow for the first three years but the crop can be harvested every second year after that.  We are working to alleviate that cashflow problem upfront in order that farmers get an annual income from the first year for the crop.<\/p><p>That has been a major impediment in our experience.  The proposal is in with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the moment.  I gather the Department is very supportive of it and we hope to submit it to the Department of Finance for inclusion in this year's budget.  That is one way in which the Government could help us to establish the willow industry.  It is wide-ranging.  We need 15,000 ha within 100 km of the power stations.  That is the position in terms of biomass support.<\/p><p> There is grant support for the private forestry sector already.  The problem with the private forestry sector at the moment is that it tends to be rather fragmented.  The grant was for 7 ha blocks.  When we met representatives from the UK-based company with which we work in this area we concluded that the minimum economically-feasible land area to harvest private forestry was approximately 20 ha.  Therefore, we have to come up with a way of putting small co-operatives together to take close proximity 7 ha blocks and harvest them in one deployment.  Some of the barriers include road access etc.  There is some grant support available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but that will be one of the challenges.  There are over 19,000 private owners of forestry in Ireland.  It is incredibly fragmented.  How we achieve scale to harvest private forestry is going to be a key challenge.<\/p><p> A question was asked about wind versus solar.  Bord na M&oacute;na has the opportunity to roll out large-scale solar panels.  I am unsure whether committee members have seen these panels.  They are 2.5 m off the ground at the front and have a maximum height of 4 m at the back.  They are relatively maintenance-free once we deploy them.  They have halved in cost since 2008.  We are talking about efficiencies of 11% or 12%.  They are becoming very economical for western Europe.  Next year's pilot will tell us a great deal about how effective those farms will be.  We will be the first company in Ireland to deploy a solar farm on that scale.  We have to work out how we are going to co-locate that with the wind farm and how that works from a grid perspective.  That is a key point.  This time next year we will know a great deal more about solar.<\/p><p> Would we opt for solar instead of wind?  That is not our strategy at the moment.  Our plan is to co-locate the solar farms with the wind farms.  This has been a proven deployment option in Europe and we intend to do the same here.  I do not have the figures on curtailment at the moment, but that is something I can come back to the committee on.<\/p><p> A question was asked about wind farm locations but I cannot give specifics on the matter.  We have identified approximately 20 locations.  I cannot tell the committee about them because we are in the process of looking at the land banks of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte as part of the joint venture announced last year.  There are approximately 30 potential sites between the two companies.  Whichever location we decide on, it is our intention by the end of this year to communicate the decision to the local community within the coming six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>There was a question on community engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#P00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Internally, we have made a decision to the effect that before we submit any planning permission we will involve the local community.

Bord na M&oacute;na is an important State asset.  Mr. Quinn outlined that last year, its profits were &euro;33 million.  This is quite a turnaround when one looks back at Bord na M&oacute;na in 1998 when significant State intervention was needed.  I know when the previous Government was listing State companies that were to examine their strategy and appropriate ownership models, Bord na M&oacute;na was not included in that list but it has engaged, and rightly so, in this process with the strategic plan, which is very important.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the ownership model, has Bord na M&oacute;na formulated a firm view in this area?  Does it want to be privately owned or does it see itself having a different regulatory regime?  Last November, it unveiled plans for an additional 210 turbines with the ESB at a cost of &euro;300 million.  What stage is this process at?  The fact that Bord na M&oacute;na is looking at expanding and investing in the forestry industry is very welcome.  It is key for Ireland.  We cannot afford to be importing materials we could produce here.  We talk about our indigenous economy and how it is the backbone of our economy.  This is a great opportunity so anything that we can do as a Government to support Bord na M&oacute;na in that role is critical because the amount of material we are importing at the moment is not sustainable.  Mr. Quinn mentioned the target of 800 to 1,000 jobs in the biomass industry by 2030.  Again, this shows how labour-intensive it is.  This is our future.

Most of the projects in the private sector that are failing to get financing are not getting it because they cannot guarantee the fuel stock.  What Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte will provide through BioEnergy Ireland is a platform for indigenous biomass to sell to BioEnergy Ireland and for projects that need fuel stock to come to BioEnergy Ireland.

To pay 51% of the overall take for 30% market share is unsustainable.  Something must be done on that to allow us at least compete on a level playing field.<\/p> <p>  With regard to other aspects that concern me, we have issues with the amount of time it takes to get through the planning process for some of the infrastructure.  I came back from the United States to take up this role.  It takes two and a half to three years to get through every step of the planning process, and some of these projects, particularly the wind projects, are very capital intensive to get to the consented planning stage.  That is something we need to examine in the future.

Quite extensive working areas for machines to turn and so on, which may not relate directly to harvesting the peat but are nevertheless part of the overall production process, are needed.  Therefore, approximately three quarters, or 60,000 ha, are actively involved in the production process.  <\/p><p> In respect of lifespan, Mr. Quinn has already noted that we expect the fuel peat to last until 2030 or thereabouts, based on current forecasts.  The horticultural peat would last a bit longer, probably another ten or 20 years, depending on demand.  <\/p><p> None of the areas that we operate production on are currently designated under the special area of conservation, SAC, or national heritage area, NHA, processes.  None of the rest of our land is either.  Over the years, in a number of cases we have passed areas to the National Parks and Wildlife Service which it has subsequently designated as SACs or NHAs.  I mentioned earlier on that we have an extensive programme of rehabilitation and restoration of peatland on which we are not actively in production.  We have a number of areas where we never entered into production although these were acquired in the same way as all other peatlands in the past.  In fact, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has identified with our co-operation and help a number of areas which may be suitable for designation as SACs and NHAs later in this year and we are co-operating fully with that process.  The reason they are so desirable or suitable for designation is because of the work we have carried out in the past in relation to restoration and rehabilitation and we are very happy to be in a situation where those lands can be designated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Senator Mullins's questions remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I will try to reply to the matters raised in sequence, if I may.

The problem is that there is lots of soil and stones, etc., in the wood and up to now we have not been able to find a machine that is capable of crushing and chipping it as the wood is very hard.  We had a demonstration last week from a German company which now appears to have a machine that is capable of chipping it.

If I may move on to the international biomass supply chain, there are two types of international biomass with which we are engaged at the moment.  We import palm kernel shells which are used in the palm oil industry.  They are coming in from Indonesia and Malaysia.  We can call the second biomass woody biomass.  We look to the USA, South America and Africa for that.  There is a power company in the UK called Drax which has converted 50% of its capacity to biomass.  Its model is that it went to the southern United States, took rights on the forestry for 20 years and built a wood pellet plant and shipping terminal and it now brings 900,000 tonnes of pellets back to the UK annually.  It constructed two 450,000 tonne plants.<\/p><p>That is potentially one model that we may look at.  I mentioned sourcing.  There will be three streams: owned infrastructure, internationally sourced contracts on long-term agreements for ten or 15 years and domestic supply.  I also mentioned that the risk of developing an international supply chain is pretty low because one can sell it on the open market.  It is a commodity-based fuel stock.<\/p><p> In regard to future modules with Coillte, we have only one which we are working on, that is, the wind farms.  The State proposes to have one company developing wind farms.  We are taking our development pipleline and Coillte's development pipeline and currently evaluating whether we can merge the two and have one company to develop wind farms.  We are not engaged with Coillte on any of the other projects, for example, anaerobic digestion, gasification or landfill gas.<\/p><p> I was asked about the number of employees.  We have 500 to 600 seasonal employees depending on how late we start the harvest.  Obviously, the later the harvest, the more people we need to try to catch up.  It is our intention to keep the 2,200 FTEs long-term but the mix will change.  There will probably be more seasonal employees than permanent employees.  The overall FTEs will be the 2,200.<\/p><p> In respect of the &euro;24.2 million, due to the reduction in volume we get almost &euro;17 million or &euro;18 million from sales.  Some &euro;8.7 million will come out of labour cost.  The reason we need &euro;8.7 million for labour costs is that 62% of the cost of producing peat is labour related, 38% is non-labour.  As there is not enough in the 38% to achieve the &euro;24.2 million, unfortunately we have to do something with the labour costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#T01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>They are the issues that are currently with the LRC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#U00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1433853000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I will not go into the specifics on that for obvious reasons.

I am aware from the presentation that Bord na M&oacute;na has a joint venture with the Cluddaun project.  It seems Bord na M&oacute;na, Coillte and ESB are running around the country almost trying to outbid each other to build various wind farms.  That is driving the planning process at which Bord na M&oacute;na is frustrated.  Will the joint venture have a responsibility to communities on the part of the three semi-State companies in this space or just carry on as at present?<\/p> <p>  In respect jof the Northern Ireland issue, have the representatives engaged with customs, the Department of Finance and the Garda?

Have the representatives engaged with Revenue on that issue?<\/p> <p>  If Bord na M&oacute;na wants to get into biomass, how is it that we had an announcement in Mayo at the weekend that a company is going to import biomass for five or six years?  Bord na M&oacute;na is one of the largest landowners in County Mayo, literally within miles of where the plant will be based.

With regard to the Coillte wind development project in County Mayo, the Cluddaun project, the reasons it was rejected from a planning standpoint are not directly applicable to our site.  There were different issues specific to that site.  Our site is absolutely adjacent.  Any site we own we develop in joint venture with ESB.<\/p><p>We have had delays also and are currently suffering from a continuing delay in achieving a revised planning.  There have been some legal developments.  A law case decision at the latter part of last year in the O'Grianna case has had a bearing on this.  We are still absolutely committed to developing that project and working hand in hand with the ESB we expect to deliver.<\/p><p> On the subject of community gain, we actively engage with the local community in terms of maintaining relationships and explaining what we are doing and the nature of the project.  We have had a series of town hall meetings.  I think a fundamental aspect of Bord na M&oacute;na's DNA is its responsibility to the community.  We in Bord na M&oacute;na regard ourselves as being part of and a product of the local community, especially in the midlands.  Generations of the same families have worked for the company.  We actively engage in local communities, in particular on infrastructure projects.  We believe it is essential to liaise actively with the communities and to bring them on the journey with us.<\/p><p> In response to the question on carbon tax and the engagement of Bord na M&oacute;na with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, we have actively engaged with both.  A couple of years ago, prior to the introduction of the carbon tax, members may remember that the then Minister for Finance deferred its introduction for a couple of years pending the introduction of a so-called robust mechanism for dealing with the issue of product coming from across  the Border.  We engaged heavily with the Revenue in relation to that.  The reality is that there is no robust mechanism that works in practice.  That is not, however, for the lack of engagement on our side.<\/p><p> The question of biomass and the announcement on Mayo Renewable Power was raised.  We have land adjacent to that project, but what has been demonstrated based on extensive trials over the years is that Bord na M&oacute;na's land does not support the growing of biomass.

An outstanding example, which the Chairman will be familiar with, is the Lough Boora Discovery Park in County Offaly.  It is an extensive area that is comprised of 3,000 acres of restored peatland.  It provides a huge tourism amenity in that part of County Offaly and in the midlands in general.  In the past year we constructed a visitor facility at the site.  Recently, the Irish tourism industry awarded the site the title of the best environmental initiative in the tourism industry in the past year.  We are very pleased with the award.  It is a tremendous site which attracts between 60,000 and 70,000 visitors per year, half of whom were from overseas and half of whom were from Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In addition, we have a number of other projects around the country.  Another example is a 400 acre site in Abbeyleix, County Laois.  Together with the local community, we have developed it into a tourism and amenity site.  If members are down in that direction, it is located on the old Cork Road and is south of Abbeyleix.  The local community has also constructed a walkway at the site in recent times.  There are a number of instances of that type of activity across our land bank and sites and across the country.

We cannot keep squeezing staff numbers.  We must start to grow our business again.  Take the briquette factories for example.  When the biomass briquette kicks in, we believe there will be a significant opportunity to develop a stove fuel.  Some 100,000 stoves per year have been sold in Ireland over the past three years.  There has been significant growth in the domestic stove market in the UK, to the extent that the solid fuel market there is growing again.  Therefore, why can we not develop a product that is unique to fuels and manufactured in our briquette factories so that we can grow top line sales?  Automation does not necessarily mean fewer jobs.  It also enables companies to grow their top line, by enabling them be more efficient and more price competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015060900002#X01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1433853000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Is there any capital investment required in terms of the conversion of some of the briquette factories to being able to use biomass?
