I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for coming here today.<\/p> <p>My Commencement matter refers to the many ladies who were covered by the marriage bar.  They were in public sector employment but were forced to leave work through no fault of their own.   Up to the abolition of this measure in 1973, women in a number of public sector bodies were obliged to resign upon marriage.  Most of these women had been covered by the State pension scheme and did not accumulate credits through the then social welfare stamp.  The superannuation contributions that had been deducted were refunded, leaving them with no pension entitlements whatsoever.<\/p> <p>The marriage bar was abolished in 1973.  Some of these ladies decided to return to employment but there was no automatic right to reinstatement and instead they had to compete for advertised vacancies.  If they returned to public sector employment they were entitled to buy back their previous service but the period between resignation and reinstatement was lost forever.  If they returned to private sector employment, they started anew with no credits whatsoever for the earlier years of their lives.<\/p> <p>Most of these women have now reached retirement age and find themselves on reduced pensions or being means tested for a non-contributory pension as a result of the enforcement of an unfair measure.  I know there are many others on reduced pensions for a wide variety of reasons.  In 2010, 43% of men were on reduced pensions and 57% received the full rate of pension.  The corresponding figure for women was 59% on reduced pensions and 41% received the full rate of pension.  These are interesting statistics and I hope to acquire the 2015 figures.  It is clear that the group of women to whom I refer were unfairly and unjustifiably treated by the State.  Surely they are entitled to the restoration of the rights that were taken from them.  I request that the Minister of State and his colleagues examine this matter sympathetically to see how they could alleviate the position of these women.  <\/p> <p>The second category covered by my Commencement matter are people who chose to concentrate on looking after their families in the home.  They were  left with no credits whatsoever and are now totally dependent on receiving a non-contributory pension if they qualify following a means test.  I accept that this category extends well beyond former public sector employees and applies to many men as well as women.  These people have served the State well and saved a considerable amount of public money by their dedication and caring attitude.  There is surely a great case for looking after these valuable citizens in their later years.  I ask that these people be regarded as self-employed and at least be given the option to participate in a contributory pension scheme to give them the credits that would enable them to obtain a full contributory pension when they become senior citizens.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maria Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2465\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is vitally important that people have the opportunity to ensure they have at least a measure of security as they approach retirement age.

As she will be aware, the marriage bar was a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments whereby women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  It was abolished in 1973 when we joined the EEC.  Where such employees were public servants, they paid a reduced rate of PRSI which did not provide cover for the State pension, and the marriage bar would not have impacted on their State pension entitlement.  It may, however, have impacted upon their entitlement to a public service pension, which is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>Our State pensions system is comprised of a number of schemes based on criteria such as contributions paid, income need and other factors.  This is to ensure that people have an adequate standard of living in old age.  The State pension contributory is one such scheme, and its rate of payment is related to contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund.  As such, those who have paid more into that fund are more likely to be paid under the scheme.  The actuarial review of the fund in 2012 confirmed that the fund provides better value to female than male contributors due to the redistributive nature of the fund.  Entitlement to the contributory pension is calculated by means of a yearly average calculation, whereby the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 may qualify at the 85% rate.<\/p> <p>The homemaker's scheme, introduced in 1994, makes qualification easier for those who took time out of the workforce on caring duties.  It allows up to 20 such years in the period since its introduction to be disregarded when the yearly average is calculated, making it easier to qualify for a higher rate of payment.  I am informed that the cost of backdating this scheme before 1994 could be as high as &euro;280 million per year.  Given that this would not benefit the poorest pensioners with little or no means, namely, State pension non-contributory and maximum-rate contributory pensioners of low means, the Government would have to consider such proposals carefully.  Such changes would impact deeply on moneys available to fund measures for all pensioners and for other people who depend on payments from the Department of Social Protection, many of whom live on much lower incomes.  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, he or she may qualify for a means tested non-contributory pension, amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  Alternatively, if the spouse is a State pensioner, his or her most beneficial payment may be the increase for a qualified adult payment, amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension.<\/p> <p>Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a total contributions approach.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this scheme.  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from around 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#C00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Is the Senator happy with that response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#C00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#C00400","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#C00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>-----for his response.

This is an issue which a colleague of mine, Councillor Eddie Mulligan, has pursued for some time and he has made specific recommendations to the Minister.  Former Deputy John Brown and Deputy Mary Butler have pursued this also, as have others.<\/p><p>What is required is flexibility.  The herring quota available in the Celtic Sea is ring-fenced per annum at approximately 1,700 tonnes.  Last December, 1,000 tonnes of this allocation to Ireland went unused in this particular area.  The reason was the detrimental weather.  What was sought at the time was to carry forward at least some of the tonnage for vessels with a proven track record even though this is not a requirement of the quota allocation for extending the quota into the following year.  Unfortunately this did not happen and therefore fishing activity this year is eating into this year's quota and not the surplus quota from last year.<\/p><p>I seek to ascertain whether there is a willingness to examine this and provide a ministerial direction to carry forward quota into next year.  Traditionally the pelagic herring quota is fished in the autumn or spring, but given that last autumn was so bad the same could happen this year.  If this were to happen the quota would go unused also.  This would be to the detriment of Irish fishermen in general, particularly in this region given the situation last year.  This is something that could happen in the other eight areas under the pelagic management quota model, but this is the case I am raising today.  I hope the Minister of State has some good news for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#C00800","speaker":"1382","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am covering for the Minister, Deputy Creed, on this occasion.<\/p> <p>The Celtic Sea sentinel herring fishery is a herring fishery for small boats under 17 m. in length operating in an area off the south-east coast known as the Dunmore box.  This is an open access fishery and track record is not considered an appropriate management tool for the small operators in this fishery.  The ministerial policy for Celtic Sea herring was adopted in 2012 after more than a year of intensive consultations with stakeholders.  This policy sets down the arrangements for the proper and effective management, conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.<\/p> <p>The 2015 quota for the sentinel fishery was 2,212 tonnes, however, only 990 tonnes were landed due to bad weather.  Under national management arrangements, quotas are allocated within the year.  Under long-standing policy, quotas may not be carried forward into the following year in respect of individual boats or groups of boats within a fishery, for example, the sentinel herring Celtic Sea fishery.  This policy protects the public ownership of quotas and protects against property rights being established which would transfer ownership of quotas into private hands.  At national level, up to 10% of uncaught quota may be carried forward to the following year, in line with the provisions of the EU regulation at national level.  In 2015, on an exceptional basis due to the impact of the Russian embargo on the pelagic markets, the limit for carryover was increased to 25% from 2015 into 2016.  The revised available quota for 2016 is 17,492 tonnes, of which 4,147 tonnes were carried forward from 2015.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Owing to the low catches in the sentinel fishery in 2015 and at the request of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum for increased fishing opportunities for the inshore fleet, the Minister proposed, on an exceptional basis, a once-off increase of 500 tonnes for this fishery for 2016.  He sought the views of stakeholders on his proposal and in all instances the views received fully supported it.  Accordingly, the Minister transferred 500 tonnes from the main fisheries allocation to the sentinel fishery for 2016.<\/p><p>This increase of 500 tonnes will not involve any change of ministerial policy on the management of the Celtic Sea herring fishery as this proposal will only be applicable to 2016.  The total allocation to the sentinel fishery for 2016 now stands at 2,380 tonnes.  In January 2016, a three-week sentinel fishery operated, which recorded landings of 535 tonnes.  The available balance for the autumn is 1,845 tonnes.<\/p><p>The Minister asked the Celtic Sea herring management advisory committee, which represents the fishing industry, to take cognisance of the impact of the opening dates on the sentinel fishery in 2015 when making its recommendation for this year.  The committee has advised that, in its experience of the fishery, the herring stock does not come close enough inshore for small sentinel vessels to catch it until around early November.  Having considered the committee&rsquo;s formal advice, I am advised that the Minister has set the opening date for the sentinel fishery as 6 November.

The proposal for a directly elected mayor of Dublin has been knocking around since the mid-2000s.  Credit is due to the former Minister for Environment and Local Government, Mr. Noel Dempsey, for taking an enlightened view on this issue.  His successor, Mr. John Gormley, and my party colleague, Councillor Dermot Lacey, have also been strong advocates for the direct election of a mayor of the capital city or the Dublin region for a five-year period.  With a population of approximately 1.3 million people, the Dublin region needs a directly elected mayor who can be a strong ambassador internationally and organise integrated planning across the four local authorities, especially with regard to investment, housing and planning.<\/p> <p>Three local authorities adjoin Dublin Bay and this requires joined up thinking, which is also needed on the DART underground proposal, the metro north project to Swords and proposals to connect Tallaght and Clondalkin to the city centre.  Business representatives in Dublin increasingly ask me why a city of 1.3 million people does not directly elect a mayor for a five-year term.  The time has come for change.  I commissioned a survey in September which found that 74% of Dubliners support a directly elected mayor.  We constantly try to persuade young people to engage with democracy and vote in elections.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The survey told me that 95.7%% of the group aged between 18 and 24 see that Dublin would benefit from having an elected mayor.

Many Ministers from different parties have been speaking about this for 15 years to try to bring forward legislation on the matter.  I ask the Minister of State to lay out the pathway in order that a plebiscite can be held in 2018 to allow for a directly-elected mayor in 2019.  This would coincide with the local and European elections.  It would be a fitting legacy for the Minister of State were he to spearhead this and deliver on something that has been spoken about for 15 years.

Michael could have a good conversation there.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Kevin Humphreys for raising this very important matter.  This is the second time today that Noel Dempsey has been praised in my presence, so I had better be careful in what I say.  As a former colleague, I have listened to him being talked about while at Meath County Council and again today.  As he had some far-reaching views when it came to reform of local government with which most people would agree, the praise is rightly due.<\/p> <p>With regard to today's discussion, I apologise that my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, could not make it to the House today.  I will take the debate on his behalf.  A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to consider directly-elected mayors in cities as part of wider potential local government reform measures including greater devolution, smaller local electoral areas, municipal governments and supports for councillors.  The programme states that having consulted widely with all relevant stakeholders, a report on all these issues will be prepared by the Minister by mid-2017 for the Government and the Oireachtas.  Scoping work on the development of proposals to address the range of issues in the programme for Government is already being undertaken in the Department.  This will identify the matters to be addressed in the report to be submitted by mid-2017.  Decisions will be a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas, as appropriate, following consideration of the report.  On the issue before the House today there are important arguments put forward for creating the office of a directly-elected mayor for Dublin.  Before reaching a conclusion however, there are significant issues that must be addressed.  Senator Humphreys has put across very well his own research on people's desire for this proposal.  It is important that the matter should be addressed properly.<\/p> <p>First and foremost it would be necessary to decide on a range of substantive statutory functions that might be assigned to a directly-elected mayor for Dublin.  What would the directly-elected mayor be in charge of, what budgetary powers would he or she have and how will these functions impact on other public bodies at central and local government?  It may well be right to make significant changes in governance for the benefit of the Dublin area, but we need to be very clear on what we are doing and why we are doing it.  There is no point in creating an office with a weak or duplicated mandate that would make the ultimate goal of delivering better services for the citizen harder, not easier, to achieve.  All aspects of the governance of the Dublin metropolitan area will need to be taken into account including questions around an overall regional authority, the relationship with the wider Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, impacts on the existing Dublin authorities and the local area governance in the villages around the city and counties of Dublin.  In addition, any proposal for a directly-elected mayor must have full regard to cost implications and staffing issues.  Resources would be needed to support the performance of the statutory functions assigned to the mayor and to support the operation of the mayor's office.<\/p> <p>The Minister will approach this issue in his planned report for Government and the Oireachtas on the basis of the benefits that have been identified with regard to the substantive functions to be performed by a mayor that improve public services for people living in and visiting the area, and whether these benefits outweigh the cost that would be involved.  I thank Senator Humphreys again.  It is an important debate to have and it is probably only warming up.  I have no doubt we will be here again on this issue in the months ahead.  The commitment is there.  The Senator wanted a timeline and it is there; to bring the report to the Houses in mid-2017.  This still gives enough time to implement it further after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#F00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Is Senator Humphreys happy or would he like a brief supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#F00400","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>No, with no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy English, I am very disappointed in the response.

The fact we could have a directly-elected mayor for very little cost has been widely debated.  However, democracy is not cheap.  If Dublin is not doing well, Ireland is not doing well.  Dublin is a main driver for financial investment.  We saw the result of the recent referendum put to our neighbours in the UK in which they decided to exit the EU.  Now more than ever, the Dublin region needs a directly-elected mayor.  It has been supported in the recent research I have done.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce and IBEC also support the idea of a directly-elected mayor.  I am disappointed by the response of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and to be honest, I hear echoes of the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, in it.  That is not something I would normally say about the Minister, Deputy Coveney.<\/p><p>We need speed and action.  There are many ways in which we can reduce the number of councillors in the Dublin region to make it a cost-effective measure.  What we really need and what is being said by the citizens of Dublin and the Chamber of Commerce is to let Dublin vote.  We have been promised this for 15 years and there has been no action.  From this response, I hear that we may get a report by 2017.  Let us make a clear decision, show leadership and put the question to the citizens of Dublin on whether they want a directly-elected mayor that can drive planning, change, investment and housing in our capital city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#F00500","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>To be very clear, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is following what is laid out in the programme for Government approach to this.  He has promised to bring forward a report in mid-2017, which still matches the timeline the Senator envisages.  We have to recognise that it is not just the Senator and his research that we have to consult.  We have to consult all the various stakeholders that this affects.  We have come through major change in local government over the last couple of years under the last Government.  Some of it has worked quite well while there are other areas in which concerns have been raised.  The Minister wants to make sure that we make this decision for the right reasons, that it leads on to better local government and better decision-making.  I understand what the Senator is saying about it being more cost-effective and more effective for decision-making, but the point is not just to have the vote for the sake of it.  It has to be genuinely for the right reasons and we have to have thought it all through.  The Senator knows how the Minister, Deputy Coveney, approaches his work.  He thinks everything through and makes sure there is a reason for it.  That report will be brought before the Houses in mid-2017 and a decision will be made on it that will bring us on to the next step.<\/p> <p>At this stage, it is worthwhile using the next four or five months to consult all stakeholders, get everyone's opinion on this and make the right decision on behalf of Dublin city.

We have seen it in the past in local authorities and we are trying to eliminate it.  If we get this right, it will be a worthwhile project.  It is important that we wait for the report and take it step by step.  It still means we can match the timelines as the Senator envisages.  There is nothing to say that cannot be achieved if the Oireachtas wants to go that way.  The report in mid-2017 is the first step and we will take it from there.

In two national newspapers today major concerns were expressed about judicial appointments.  Last week the Minister for Justice and Equality was in the House and, in fairness to her, she indicated that she would bring forward some reforms.  Having a veto on judicial appointments is wrong and constitutionally questionable.  We are now in a situation where a Minister has told the public and the political system that he has received a cast iron commitment and has an agreement with the Government.  This raises serious questions about the separation of powers and the overlap in this matter.  Tomorrow we will debate a Private Member's motion on the establishment of a judicial council.  I do not want to spend all of the time allotted to me talking about this issue, but, clearly, it has reached the heights of being mentioned in the national press and forms part of the editorial in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.

We cannot have a situation where people are queuing up to have appeals heard, yet there are no judges available to hear them.  This is about the Judiciary and the separation of powers.  It is imperative that the Minister come to the House tomorrow to clarify the position or issue a statement on the current position.  I want her to clarify if there is an agreement that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Independent Alliance state they have.

Last week, during the debate on Sinn F&eacute;in's Rent Certainty Bill, we pressed the point that the situation in the sector was getting worse and that time was the crucial factor.  The Bill would have helped thousands of families in Dublin and throughout the country who are worried out their minds about how they will meet the extortionate increases in rent.  They do not have the money to keep a roof over their heads, which is why the homeless figures are increasing on a monthly basis, yet despite all of this, Fianna F&aacute;il and its partners in government, Fine Gael, saw fit to kick the can down the road once again.  On the same night that Fianna F&aacute;il voted against providing rent certainty for tenants Deputy Barry Cowen complained that there was nothing in the budget for those in the private rental sector.  Many of the problems identified in the report for those in social housing and tenants in the private rental sector were addressed in Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill.  There are now 328,700 people reliant on the private rental sector for accommodation.  The vacancy rate is only 1.45%.  This is a staggering number of people who are the mercy of a system that clearly does not work for anybody.  One of the suggestions made in the report is that the number of vacant units would need to increase by 300% in order to see rent stabilisation.  That is obviously unobtainable in the short term and means that the only viable option is introducing rent certainty.<\/p> <p>There is also the problem of people living in local authority housing that has fallen into disrepair.  There are houses that have not been renovated for decades.  I have been in many such homes and the wind blew through the gaps in windows.

These concerns have been echoed and vindicated across Europe in the week since by lawyers who have made it clear that declarations do not carry legal weight; by the German Constitutional Court, which last Thursday demanded new and explicit assurances; by the Council of Europe Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development; and by a vote in Wallonia, in Belgium, on Friday.  While our Government happily signed off on the deal last week, others have been demanding something better.  Germany, for example, produced today a new declaration of its own designed to address constitutional concerns, Belgium has spent the weekend in negotiations and, finally, belatedly, at 9 p.m. last night, we began to hear reports of new text emerging from the European Commission, which mentioned the Vienna Convention and included actual legal references.  These changes did not come soon enough or go far enough, and provisional application has not been signed at the meetings of the Council of Ministers today.<\/p> <p>The talks now continue.  It is thanks to public and parliamentary pressure that we are achieving the changes deserved.  We are now told there will be an EU leaders' summit on 20 and 21 October, later this week.  It hopes and plans to send a strong message of reassurance to citizens that their concerns about the side effects of new generation trade deals will be addressed.  This will be the first comprehensive debate on trade since the current European Commission was appointed, and it must be a robust debate because there is no consensus and not everyone agrees.  The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said in recent weeks, \"The fact is that in the Council of Ministers you have 12 [countries] in favour of ... strengthening trade defence instruments, and you have ... 12 [countries] who do not like the idea\".  By \"trade defence instruments\", he means investor courts.<\/p> <p>Where does Ireland stand among these countries?  CETA is still a badly designed new generation deal which represents a dangerous overreach from the proper area, an appropriate area of trade and tariffs, to the areas of public policy and public accountability.  However, if there is a chance now to potentially remove the worst element, namely, the investor courts, corporate courts which can place such huge charge on our public finances, will Ireland seize this opportunity?  Will Ireland support changes that might remove these investor courts at the summit this week?  I ask the Leader to put it to the Government, which so lightly dismissed the Seanad motion last week, to reflect now on the legitimate concerns of this House and the concerns of the Irish public and reflect them at the summit of leaders.<\/p> <p>I note - this is a compliment to the Government - that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, today announced plans to ratify our climate change commitments.  This is a welcome development.  However, will the Government press for good trade deals that support rather than threaten those climate change commitments, deliver trade while protecting quality, health and workers' rights and recognise that public good and public accountability must always remain the bottom line?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#P00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I renew calls on the Leader for debate on Syria and the appalling bombardment of civilians which continues daily in Aleppo, where yesterday 100 people were killed in the ongoing bombardment.

I can assure the House that until some action is taken, I will continue to raise it.  It is the plight of the Irish mushroom industry as a result of the Brexit vote.  Again this weekend, I have had communication with people within the industry.  This industry employs 3,500 people in rural areas where jobs are not ten a penny.  Already to date, there are 130 jobs lost.  Given the change in the exchange rate between sterling and euro, when suppliers receive cheques for contracts, which they had signed into prior to the vote and cannot revoke on until they come up for renewal between January and March next year, they now have a difference of up to &euro;25,000 in what they receive for &pound;100,000 sterling.<\/p><p>The industry is going under.  We had members of the industry here in the Houses.  They met the committee, the relevant Ministers and everybody who would lend them an ear.  It was a sympathetic ear they received all round.  Then, budget day came and went and there was not one iota done for this industry.  The people in the industry are a resilient group and are very confident that if they can ride this storm, this time next year the mushroom export industry will be stronger than ever.  Their main competition for contracts in the UK market was from eastern Europe.  Now the eastern Europeans have run scared as a result of the situation and the position in which the Irish industry finds itself.  Therefore, they are confident that if they can survive and ride this storm, when they renegotiate their contracts in the new year, there will be a strong a vibrant industry.  Can they ride this storm?  The consensus is they cannot and they will not.  Nobody can live with the losses they have taken.<\/p><p>I plead with the Leader that we get each and every relevant Minister in here to not merely listen to statements, note them and walk out again.  If this industry or these individuals were offering 130 jobs or the potential to duplicate that number, there would be a queue of Ministers trying to claim credit.  In full and sustainable employment, when does the word \"sustainable\" come into play?  It is as important to hold what we have as it is to be banging drums and looking for credit in creating new jobs.  It is imperative and I propose that a Minister comes before the House and that the Minister answers.  I am aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is due to attend the House next week.  Let him come in to the House with answers.<\/p><p>This industry is going under and it will not be retrievable.  It is not a situation whereby if they lose a job today, when the markets and contracts change in January, they will revitalise that job.  Once it is gone, it is gone.  The &euro;7 million that is already gone has been taken up by Dutch suppliers.  We are posturing with contingency plans for Brexit and what may happen.  This is one of the first major outcomes of Brexit and we are found standing offside.  If our answer to everything else that might come down the line is the same, this economy is going to be ruined by Brexit.  Let us show what we can do, will do and what we will potentially do in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#S00500","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I want to raise two items.

It is a matter I have consistently raised, along with many other Members from a broad range of political opinion, on the floor of this Chamber.

They will continue to feel it and will probably feel it much worse and sharper in the coming months and years.  It was unbelievable that yesterday, in the Stormont Assembly in the North, a motion seeking to assert the Assembly's wish to have special EU status granted to the North was actually lost as a result of two MLAs who aligned themselves with Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and the boys.

It is new research but it builds on previous research, which shows, statistically, that if there is a recovery, it is very much a two-tier recovery and rural Ireland is not feeling the recovery in the same way as urban areas.  This builds on work done by Social Justice Ireland, the Vincentian Partnership etc.  The report demonstrates that the poverty rate is much higher in the Border, midlands and west regions, in particular, with one in five people experiencing rural poverty, half of whom experience it on an ongoing basis.  The report also highlights farm poverty, fuel and energy poverty and issues relating to services for women and children in rural Ireland and social inclusion.  It is an important report which we should debate.  In the context of fuel and energy policy, the greater cost of buying fuel in a rural area is highlighted because of transport costs etc.<\/p> <p>The other House is debating bogs again.  That happens to coincide with letters that have been sent to turf cutters in Connemara who had been told they would be allowed to continue in the traditional manner but are now being told they will have to pay for environmental impact statements to be done if they are to continue.  I would like a debate with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, about turf cutting and these designations.  Irish Rural Link noted that it has been trying to secure a meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, about rural transport.

The scheme has great potential to increase the social housing stock by bringing back into use empty and substandard privately-owned houses.  Since we last had the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government before the House, further details of the scheme have been placed in the public domain, including information on two pilot projects in Waterford and Carlow.  The scheme must be as flexible as possible and it is important at this point that the Seanad contribute to the debate.  The scheme will only apply to leased property or property that a local authority or an approved housing body might lease from a private owner.  Many private owners do not want to become landlords.  The scheme is not attractive because one has to pay PRSI and there is also the PRTB involved.  We have to take this into account and provide that in certain instances local authorities might buy the properties in question.<\/p> <p>In my county the most recent census figures show that 24% of the housing stock is empty.  As I understand it, that is 24% of 65,000 houses at a time when there are 1,600 people on the housing list.  There was a similar figure in 2010.  There are a variety of house types, some of which are older houses in older parts of the town, some of which are in unfinished housing estates or established housing estates but which have not been lived in for years.  We need to get technicians on the ground.  That happened in 2010 when inspectors who had been working for the Department in granting the first-time buyer's grant went on the ground.  We need people to knock on doors and establish why these properties are vacant and nobody is earning anything on them.  We need to establish where the houses are that are tied with banks and the builder or owner is not in a position to sell.  A further significant point is that banks will currently sell to vulture or venture funds, but they are not being mandated to offer to local authorities the suites of houses they possess that would be suitable for social housing.  That would be the fastest way to increase the social housing stock of local authorities.  I ask that the Minister be invited back to the House in the light of the great potential of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#W00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I want to talk about a possible upside of Brexit, albeit we have to seize the opportunity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aidan Davitt:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to advise whether she has put a strategy in place to target and attract businesses and financial institutions that are likely to move their operations out of Britain as a result of Brexit.

I do not mind where we go, but what is happening at the moment is an absolute farce, with the possibility of huge disruption to the activities of the National Museum.  So far, nothing is happening.  I appreciate that a lot of work is going on behind the scenes, but we must now call a halt to all of this uncertainty.  It might be time to bring the Parliament to the people, as colleagues have suggested, by having sittings of the Seanad around the country.  The current situation has gone on too long, with the proposals expected to cost, I understand, nearly &euro;1.5 million.  Officials have put a great deal of work into the relocation but anybody looking in from the outside would surely conclude we are incapable of making a decision for ourselves.  There are a lot of venues around the country, private and public, including hotels and so on, which might accommodate us.  We cannot go on as we are.<\/p> <p>Of course, this is not about accommodating Senators but about ensuring Parliament has a place to meet and legislate.  If an agreement cannot be reached on relocation, despite the engagement by so many Departments, it may well be the case that we are looking at an interdepartmental turf war.  Somebody will be inconvenienced and somebody will be seeking more money.  It is us Senators, however, who will be held to account for the delay.  The word must go out from this Chamber that we do not care where we are put, even if it is a tent in St. Stephen's Green, but a decision must be made in the next two or three months.  People are having a laugh at the way we cannot come to an agreement.  It is not Senators or the Ceann Comhairle who are at fault here; the problem has arisen because the different Departments cannot come to an agreement.  We should bring in the private sector to secure a venue for us sooner rather than later and likely for better value and at less inconvenience to all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#X00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I support my Kerry colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, in his comments on the St. Mary of the Angels facility in Beaufort.

On my own behalf and on behalf of all of us here, I extend to his family our deepest sympathies.

A process is being undertaken and managed by the OPW with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The superintendent of the Houses and representatives of the OPW and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs are involved.  It is important we allow that to take its course.  Equally, in tandem with that process, it is important we allay the fears or worries of members of staff of the museum.  If this House is moved to the museum, they will find us willing, able and happy to cohabit with them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We will work and live together happily.  It is important if there are concerns that they are ironed out and addressed.  It would be helpful if all sides shared information on the issues and processes involved.  To go into hysterics today would be wrong.  It is important that we allow the process to take its course and I hope we will do so.<\/p><p>Senators Gavan and Gallagher raised the issue of industrial relations.  Senator Gavan, as a former trade unionist, should know well that the most important part of any process is to engage in dialogue, negotiations and to continue talking.  I understand quite clearly the frustration felt by members of the Garda and the AGSI.  Senator Gallagher raised this matter as well.  It has been clear for a while, and not just today or yesterday, that there have been issues with Garda pay, conditions and terms of service.  Equally, with the members of the ASTI in regard to their issues.  As a former member of the ASTI who went on strike once, I know it is important that dialogue and negotiations by all sides take place.  There is no room, in this day and age, for any of us to be complacent in regard to an aspect or issue of public sector pay.  The vehicle of a public service commission to consider public sector pay is one that should be commissioned and started quickly because industrial unrest does not do anyone any good, not least those who vote to go on strike.  I appeal, as the Leader of the Seanad, to members of the ASTI, GRA and the AGSI that they will find Ministers Fitzgerald, Donohoe and Bruton are willing and anxious to engage and I hope the union members will engage.  <\/p><p>Senator Humphreys raised a clear issue about the EPA and Moneypoint.  I shall invite the Minister to the House the discuss the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Daly has been vocal about the mushroom industry and a potential negative impact on 3,500 jobs.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be in the House next week.  The Senator is very able and I am sure he is willing to put his points to the Minister.  I share the views expressed by the Senator.  Equally, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, has been involved and engaged with key stakeholders in the mushroom industry.  I know from my conversations with him that he met the industry last week because I was in attendance when we met one of the key people in the industry.  Therefore, I know he is taking the issue seriously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#Z02600","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>He has had meetings without outcomes.

The matter is of huge concern to the families in question.  It is a fact that as a society we must face up to how we deal with the issue of displacement from congregated settings into the community.  This and other Governments have followed a policy of closing institutions and moving people to live in the community.  This has had an impact and the impact Senator Paul Coghlan, in particular, outlined articulately of the distress caused by the loss of familiarity and routine in the day-to-day lives of those affected is one we must try to work to overcome.  I hope the families will be engaged with, that information will be provided and that the issues raised by the Senators will be addressed.  I will be happy to have the matter discussed with the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, or the relevant Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in particular.  It is one to which we will have to face up as a nation.  We have an ageing population of men and women with a disability who have become used to routine.  It is an issue we all face in our communities, one to which we should return and perhaps deal in a special debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#AA01600","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I extend my sincere condolences to the Foley family on the death of the Munster great and Ireland stalwart, Anthony Foley.

It is a great pleasure to be in the Seanad this afternoon.  This is my first opportunity to be here as Minister, but I assure the House I was looking forward to it greatly.  The time I spent here was some of the best time of my life.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss my work in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and I look forward to hearing the views and input of Senators.<\/p> <p>As Senators are aware, my remarks are timely, coming a week after the announcement of budget 2017 and just as the long overdue public, political and media debate on child care is finally under way.  I want to share a vision for a future which has affordable, accessible and high-quality child care policies, vibrant youth services, best practice assistance for young people with difficulties and, above all, an inclusive future that values all children for who they are.<\/p> <p>Through listening to children and affording them the freedom, dignity and all the respect they deserve, we can build a caring, engaged and flourishing society from the ground up.  In the budget last week, I was pleased to secure a 15% increase in funding for services to support children, young people and families.  Additional funding of &euro;173 million brought the total funding of the Department to more than &euro;1.3 billion.  This is a hugely significant investment which has grown, even through adversity, and is helping to create a fundamentally different approach to how the State engages with its children and young people.  The funding increase will allow us to introduce a radical new approach to child care, with high quality care and education that is open to all children, and deliver extra community youth services throughout the country and better funded supports for young people and families who need it most.<\/p> <p>Children deserve to be free of fear, poverty and deprivation and to feel safe and valued.  I look forward to continuing my work with children, young people, parents and front-line services to ensure the money secured in the budget will be used to deliver the best possible outcomes for all.<\/p> <p>A major policy priority for me is the development of a single affordable child care scheme.  This will replace existing child care subsidisation schemes, excluding the free preschool scheme, with a single streamlined scheme from September 2017.  This is an ambitious timetable, but the Department is working intensively on it.  The new scheme is a major step in making quality child care more affordable and will enable universal and targeted subsidies for parents towards their child care costs.<\/p> <p>Under the targeted measure of the new single affordable child care scheme, parents will qualify based on their net income.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While I do not wish to pre-empt the input of Senators, let me first clear up some misinformation which has entered the debate and unfortunately become part of the discourse on the scheme.  The policy proposals for the new scheme were always based on net income and there are a number of reasons for this.  A net income approach better provides for a fair and reasonable measure of the resources available to a family.  It ensures an equitable approach to assessment across incomes that are subject to taxation and incomes that are largely non-taxable.  Basing the approach on net income best supports equal treatment of all different types of income and best supports people to move from social welfare to employment or increased hours of employment.  As such, the approach is supportive of equity and labour market activation policy objectives and should ensure the scheme is helpful to working families on low to moderate incomes, prioritising those on the lowest incomes.  I hope this will be particularly effective for the children of lone parents and those children who are living in households below or close to the poverty line.<br\/><br\/>Subsidies will be available for children aged from six months to 15 years and will meet families full-time and part-time child care needs, including outside of school hours and during school holiday time.  This will also assist the early years workforce.  I am fully aware that some of these staff currently have 38-week contracts only.  The new scheme will subsidise parents' child care costs beyond term time, creating full year and sometimes full-time contracts for more child care staff. <br\/><br\/>International research confirms that access to high quality and affordable child care is particularly important and beneficial for children from lower income families.  First and foremost, education and employment is the best route out of poverty.  Affordable child care supports parents in lower income families to access further education and the labour market.  While labour market activation is a key policy objective of the scheme, it does not force parents into the workforce but simply provides them with a choice.  If families have access to affordable child care, some will continue to choose to remain in the home with their children and some will opt to increase the household income through employment.  This scheme will give families a real choice.  According to data from the Central Statistics Office, 19% of people in jobless households are in consistent poverty compared with 8% of those in households with one person working and only 1.5% of those in households with two people working. <br\/><br\/>I also want to be clear on a point regarding whether formal child care is good or bad for children.  The research on this area is also clear.  High quality child care supports child development and this benefit is greater for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  For this reason, I have ensured the overwhelming majority of funding available under the single child care affordable scheme in 2017 will be targeted at lower income families, with a subsidy of approximately &euro;8,000 per annum available at the highest rate based on the maximum of 40 hours of child care per week, although it is not a requirement that child care is provided for 40 hours per week.  It is my hope that this will help families to overcome disadvantage and contribute to a reduction in child poverty.  Under the initial terms of the scheme, households earning up to &euro;47,500 net income will be able to avail of subsidised child care and I hope future budgets will enable me to increase this threshold year on year. <br\/><br\/>At the same time, I am aware that child care is at its most expensive for children under three years of age.  This is a prime reason the second element of the new scheme is a universal measure to all families with children under three years.  Funding of &euro;7 million has been made available to provide a universal subsidy for children in that age range availing of formal child care.  From September 2017, a universal subsidy of up to &euro;80 per month will provided towards child care costs.  This equates to more than &euro;900 per annum for parents working full time and will be paid on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis.  The programme for Government commits to the introduction of a robust model for subsidised, high quality child care for children aged from nine months to 36 months.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Currently, paid paternity leave in Ireland extends to 26 weeks - or about six months - but the programme for Government commits to further increasing paid parental leave in the first year of life and I certainly will be in favour of promoting that.  It is my hope therefore that Ireland will get to this point sooner rather than later but until we do, the affordable child care scheme will be available from six months of age.  This approach recognises that the cost of child care can push many parents out of the labour market when paid leave ends.  Indeed the gap between the end of paid leave and the start of an entitlement to early care and education is an international indicator used to examine national policies in this area.  The single affordable child care scheme does not amount to discrimination against stay-at-home parents.  This is a scheme to support children.  It aims to make child care more affordable for all families, giving all families more choice.  The Government directly supports stay-at-home parents through the home carer tax credit, which has been increased to &euro;1,100 per year.  I support an increase in the earnings threshold for this and I have already spoken to the Minister for Finance about it.  A priority for my Department has been to address child poverty through further education and labour market activation.  That priority was established through feedback to politicians on the doorsteps and from the European Commission which gave Ireland recommendations - for two years in a row - to make high-quality child care more affordable and accessible.  This new scheme is not an answer to all our parenting and family support needs but it does make high-quality child care more affordable.  It is just a first step.<\/p><p>In 2017 the expected number of children who will benefit from the new single affordable child care scheme is estimated at 79,000.  This includes 25,000 children who will benefit from the universal subsidy.  An estimated 54,000 children will benefit from the targeted subsidies, including 31,500 children who already receive support under the current targeted schemes and 22,500 new beneficiaries.  The scheme will be open to all child care providers who are registered with Tusla initially, including both centre-based child care providers and childminders.  It is important for children and families that, if the State is subsidising child care, it subsidises services that have been quality assured.  Currently Tusla quality assures child care services for my Department and over 4,500 services are already registered with Tusla.  Only a small percentage of childminders are registered with Tusla currently, or eligible to register.  More could be registered and I hope that more of those eligible for registration will do so over the next few months.  I am currently working with Childminding Ireland to explore how a far greater proportion of childminders could be quality assured in order to access State funding under this scheme.  Options to be explored will include a system of non-statutory quality assurance, possibly leading to statutory registration in the medium to long term.<\/p><p>The issue of capacity in the child care sector is complex also.  Supply can depend on demand as well as the costs - including rents and staff wages, which need to be set at realistic levels that value the work of child care professionals.  Demand for child care in turn depends on parental choice, among other factors.  My Department has experience in assisting the sector with successful expansion - going back to its foundation and before - with the capital grants of the early 2000s that produced some excellent facilities that are still in daily use.  This past year we focused on the expansion of the free pre-school scheme, which is now under way.  My Department projects that the expanded early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme will have a peak enrolment of 127,000 children in the April to June session in 2017.  This is an increase of 60,000 children from the pre-expansion volume.  Again, let me assure Senators that despite some media controversy, the timeline on this was not missed.  The measure was announced in budget 2016 by Senator James Reilly and delivered this September on schedule.  I commend the early years sector on responding to this expansion by creating capacity.  As of this week, I understand there are more than 86,000 children registered in ECCE services, up almost 20,000 children on this time last year.  It is too easy to always move to the next development but it is right that I should acknowledge the tireless work of my predecessor, who did so much under those very difficult circumstances of the past.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a result of this expansion, parents will benefit from an average of 61 weeks of free preschool provision for their children, thereby saving an average of &euro;4,000 on child care costs for each eligible child.  Budget 2017 also enables full roll-out of the access and inclusion model, AIM, to support children with disabilities to attend mainstream preschools.<\/p><p>In anticipation of the increased demand for places on the early childhood care and education scheme for 2016-17 and to support the sector to meet its capacity needs, I have introduced a number of measures to assist early years providers.  For example, I provided a &euro;2.5 million increase in capital funding for early years services seeking to increase capacity, thereby making available a total of &euro;6.5 million in 2016 and allowing all applications that met the criteria for grant funding to be approved.  The capital scheme has already provided several thousand new places and this number will increase as works are completed.<\/p><p>Supply of child care also depends on the availability of qualified staff and sufficient funding to pay them a fair wage.  I am providing targeted learner funds to enable child care workers to attain recognised qualifications.  In addition, I have widened access to the higher rate of ECCE capitation for the 2016-17 preschool year.  That capitation rate is now set at &euro;75 per child per week, with standard capitation set at &euro;64.50 per child per week  This restoration of rates follows the cuts that were applied in recent years.  My Department has worked closely in recent months with child care committees across the country to analyse demand for places on a geographic basis, identify any shortages in provision and work intensively with services in areas where shortfalls might have been expected to occur.  I am delighted the sector was able to meet all capacity demands for this September and is expected to meet demand in January for the next intake to ECCE.  I thank the 30 city and county child care committees that helped my Department to assess demand and supply - a very complicated task - for the expanded ECCE programme.  I look forward to working with them again in the coming years as we seek to increase capacity further to meet the increased demand we anticipate will occur because of the new scheme.  I hope to be able to incentivise the sector to create new capacity through a number of measures.  For instance, I am considering how the capital funding available to me in 2017 can best be invested.  I welcome Senators' views in this regard.<\/p><p>I have focused my remarks on the child care sector.  I will conclude by referring briefly to several other areas of work.  I attach a very high priority to the work of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which provides essential services to some of the most vulnerable children and families in our society.  I have secured an additional &euro;37 million to allow the agency to continue its ambitious programme of reforming its services and building an effective and responsive child protection and welfare system.  Later this week, I will outline details of an extra &euro;5.5 million for youth projects across the country.  There is also increased funding to enable the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to fulfil their operational roles and statutory duties.<\/p><p>I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions, which will help to inform the future direction of services to support children, young people and their families.

We in Fianna F&aacute;il support the investment in early education and child care announced in the recent budget.  That investment is the first step on the road to allowing families a greater choice and supporting women to remain in the workplace,  should they so wish, following the birth of their children.  The health and safety of our children should be the most important concern of any Government.  To that end, Tusla must be adequately resourced to allow for more inspectors to facilitate the registering of childminders who wish to register in advance of the September 2017 start date.  Will the Minister address how the delays in Garda vetting waiting times will be addressed in advance of the start date?<\/p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has always been the party of education.  Early years education is the first rung on that ladder and we must value the sector and those who work in it.  I call on the Minister to give a firm commitment that investment in this area will be not only maintained but increased over the lifetime of this Government.  The early childhood care and education scheme was introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government and expanded upon by the last Government.  The scheme must now be reviewed in light of the new targeted universal scheme the Minister announced in the budget.  I have concerns as to how the two schemes will interact.  As all parents know, the so-called provision of two free years of preschool is anything but that.  In fact, each year consists only of 38 weeks of preschool care, rather than 52 weeks.  Moreover, the way the scheme is designed means most children avail of significantly fewer than 76 weeks, with the average being around 60 weeks.<\/p> <p>The new universal scheme, I understand, will run until the child becomes eligible for the ECCE scheme.  However, because of the three different entry points, many children have to wait for months beyond their third birthday before they become eligible for the ECCE scheme.  My own daughter, who was a September baby, will not be able to access the scheme until the January following her third birthday.  This causes problems for families who must, in order to secure a place, pay for it from September.  Child care providers cannot be expected to hold places open until January or April when the children become eligible.  Will the Minister consider changing the entry points and expanding the scheme to provide a full 104 weeks of care?  Will she, in the meantime, allow parents to access 76 weeks of care?  The lack of full-years payments is seriously affecting the sector.  Many child care workers have to sign on during the weeks not covered by the scheme, which leads to low staff morale, puts pressure on staff in the workplace and has the potential to impact on the children in their care.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to consider providing greater support for providers based in urban centres in order to ensure there is capacity in the system.  For example, providers in my own constituency of Dublin Fingal have some of the highest premises costs in the country.  It is very difficult for providers to offer a good-quality service at a low cost to parents when they must pay astronomical rents.  This impacts on capacity because the main bulk of children are based in urban centres.  Notwithstanding these concerns, ECCE is a great scheme and the universality aspect is very much to be welcomed.  We must value all our children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are renting a property and their former family home, which is in deep negative equity, is rented out to support the mortgage on it.  If that income is taken into account, it could seriously discriminate against those people the Minister is trying to protect with this scheme.  I ask the Minister to ensure it is only earned income and not rental income on a former family home in deep negative equity that is taken into account.  <\/p><p>Finally, Fianna F&aacute;il supports an increase in maternity leave beyond the current 26 weeks and the introduction of shared leave between parents.  This would support families in the precious early weeks and months and would encourage greater participation by both parents in parenting their child.  I urge the Minister to prioritise this in future budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#FF00200","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Without a shadow of a doubt, those in the child care area are particularly enthused and excited by the Minister.  I also wish to commend the clarity of the messages and press releases from her Department since she became Minister.  They are excellent, clear, concise and deliverable messages that all can understand.  I have spoken to a number of Senators who have also commented on this.  I just wanted to pass that on and would ask the Minister to pass it on to her staff.  The messages are crisp and clear, there is no ambiguity about them, they are simple and usually only run to one page.  I do not want to associate the Minister with former politicians who referred to one page but I acknowledge the quality of the departmental communications.<\/p> <p>Before I deal with the affordable child care scheme, which the Minister has spent most of her time here talking about, it is important to point out that every Government Minister should keep a copy of the programme for Government on his or her desk.  We talk about new politics and co-operation but in reality, it is not a question of new politics but of everyone working together to get business done, which is no bad thing.  <\/p> <p>I would like the Minister to address a number of issues, if not today, then at some point in the future.  The first issue is the Government's proposal for new in-school speech and language services, for which there is a real need.  I am constantly receiving representations about speech and language therapy.  That commitment is contained in the programme for Government.  The Government is also supposedly committed to further investment in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which is really critical.  Early intervention is so important in children's formation and can shape outcomes into the future.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this issue.  I am also interested in hearing the Minister's views on the proposal to develop a national parenting support plan, which is also contained in the programme for Government.  I do not want to go into too much detail on all of this now but I ask the Minister, on her return to this House at a future date, to go through those sections of the programme for Government that relate to her Department and to outline progress on same.<\/p> <p>I would like to hear the Minister's views on how the local city and county councils' child care committees are dovetailing with her work and how the Department liaising with them.  There are long-established child care committees in every local authority but I am not hearing too much about them.  Are they being utilised to the full?  I would also like to hear some more about capacity in the child care sector.  Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee referred to capacity in her contribution.  We are constantly hearing about people who cannot get access to child care.  Capacity is an issue and many people are leaving the sector because of new regulations.  I have no problem with the new, stringent regulations relating to child care provision, which are really important but people are opting out because of them.  Capacity is a real issue in south County Dublin and, I am sure, all over the country in both urban and rural areas.  There seems to be some confusion about existing schemes which the new affordable child care scheme will replace and perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter.  We currently have the community child care subvention scheme, the child care and educational training support programmes, the after school child care programme and the community employment child care programme.  The Minister's new scheme will take all of that over.  Will it replace the existing schemes and when?  There is a lot of ambiguity about that.  When is the scheme kicking in?  We know it will kick in some time in 2017.  How will it impact the existing schemes?  Can the Minister tell us today that her affordable child care scheme will replace the aforementioned schemes, namely the community child care subvention scheme, the child care and educational training support programme, the after school child care programme and the community employment child care programme.  The people involved in those schemes are not too sure what will happen.  <\/p> <p>I wish the Minister well.  She is in an exciting ministry and I wish her the best of luck with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#GG00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and am delighted to contribute to the debate on the important measures that have been introduced.<\/p> <p>As a percentage of wages, net child care costs in Ireland are among the highest in the EU.  They are the second highest for couples and the highest for single parents.  We have a country-specific recommendation from the European Commission to improve this but we have a long way to go when it comes to child care in this country.  <\/p> <p>Obviously child care needs differ in every home and parents want more choice and more affordable options.  The cost of child care is a significant matter playing on the minds of working parents, as well as whether it will work out for them.  Indeed, it was the single most frequently raised issue during the recent general election campaign.  During the canvass, child care was something that came up at every second door.  It is something that particularly affects couples who are out at work.<\/p> <p>The Growing Up in Ireland study, perhaps the most important piece of research ever undertaken in this country, has now completed its first decade of work.  The study included research on parents' child care choices.  The data collected in 2008 and 2009 showed that 23% and 50% of children aged nine months, three years and nine years received non-parental care.  Parental care was favoured by the majority for all age groups.  Where parental care was not possible, the favoured option for babies was relative care, followed by a childminder, followed by centre-based care.  Centre-based care was favoured over childminders for children over three years of age.  An additional source of data on parental choice is the CSO.  Although the latest available data are from 2007, they showed that most parents at that time opted to have their children cared for by a parent.  Of the 25% who did not do so, child care provided by a relative was the favoured option.  <\/p> <p>Since 2007, however, child care costs have increased and with the intervening downturn, many middle-income parents found child care costs an overwhelming financial burden.  As such, I strongly welcome the inclusion of the affordable child care scheme in budget 2017 and acknowledge the vital role the Minister has played in bringing that to fruition.  The &euro;19 million in additional funds provided by the scheme will be added to the funding for the existing targeted schemes to arrive at an overall budget for the scheme.  The scheme will be available from September 2017 and will provide crucial financial support for parents towards the significant cost of child care in this country.  This affordable child care scheme will replace the existing targeted child care subsidisation scheme with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  It will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of child care which is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>The Minister has already outlined the many benefits of the new scheme, key among them being the reduction in poverty.  We have been given some fairly clear directions in that regard from the EU.  The scheme will enhance affordability and encourage labour market activation.  I welcome the fact that overall, this scheme is pro-women and pro-family.  It gives excellent assistance to working families.  <\/p> <p>The scheme will be open to all child care providers who are registered with Tusla, including both centre-based child care providers - cr&egrave;ches, pre-schools and day centres - and childminders.  Crucially, as the Minister outlined, it is a national scheme which will be open to all child care providers.  Participation in the scheme by those providers will be voluntary and the choice of child care provider will be one for parents, subject to the provider participating in the scheme.  Local city and county child care committees will be able to help parents to find providers who are participating in the scheme.  It is expected that the 900 community or not-for-profit services currently in existence will register for the scheme, in addition to a large percentage of private providers.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government is committed to the introduction of a robust model for subsidised, high-quality child care for children aged nine to 36 months.  At present, paid maternity leave in Ireland extends to 26 weeks or roughly six months, although the programme for Government commits to further increases in parental leave in the first year of a child's life.  In line with current leave entitlements, the universal subsidy will be available from six months.  This approach recognises that the cost of child care can push many parents out of the labour market when paid leave ends.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Indeed, the gap between the end of paid leave and the start of an entitlement to early care and education is an international indicator used to examine national policies in this area.  I believe this provides a much-needed and long-awaited break for squeezed middle-income families who may have previously just missed out on several other family assistance schemes due to means test eligibility grounds.<\/p><p>With regard to the issue of informal care from grandparents and neighbours, it is vital that the value of the work they do is recognised.  However, for the State to subsidise children&rsquo;s care, there exists a need to know where the children are and who the childminders are.  There is scope for abuse and I would welcome hearing the Minister's view.  It is the responsibility of the State to assess the children who are being minded.<\/p><p>How does Ireland&rsquo;s early years spending compare with other countries?  Including the spend on infant classes in primary schools, total early years spending in Ireland post-budget 2017 will be 0.55% of GDP, using 2014 GDP figures, an increase on this year&rsquo;s 0.5% GDP figure.  For the first time, total early years spending, including spending on infant classes in primary schools,  will now exceed &euro;1 billion per year.  While this represents great progress, there has been some criticism of the scheme by a number of child care providers and cr&egrave;che owners, who say they are not benefiting in any way.  They have pointed out that the scheme should have included a subsidy for providers to ensure the quality of the child care is of a high standard.  They may have a point in this regard and additional funding to assist child care providers to ensure quality should be considered as a matter of priority.  I would welcome the Minister's comments.<\/p><p>There have also been some objections from stay-at-home parents who choose to keep their children at home and who claim they are not being valued to same degree as child care providers.  Although there is a provision in this scheme to increase their tax credit by &euro;100, raising it to &euro;1,100 in total, perhaps this point should be examined further.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this also.<\/p><p>This budget builds on universal progress made to date.  The universal aspect is to help parents who want or need to go back to work or education.  It bridges the gap in what is an expensive time from the end of maternity leave to the start of the free pre-school year.  I agree with Senator Clifford-Lee's comments with regard to the point that pre-school year is limited and can create difficulties for many families.  Nonetheless, for a couple with a child in full-time cr&egrave;che or with a registered childminder, the saving will work out at &euro;906, which is significant.  It builds on last month&rsquo;s introduction of the second free pre-school year, which is saving parents on average &euro;4,000 per child.  The number of children benefiting from the extension is going from 67,000 to some 127,000.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister's work on this very important area, which has been long-neglected.  I welcome the Government's focus on it for the last number of years and its renewed current focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#GG00300","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister coming to the Seanad and taking the time to listen to the concerns and observations we have, as well as the positivity we have for the Minister's brief and for the children of Ireland.  I would like to provide a context for the Ireland children are growing up in today.  In the days before the announcement of the budget, I attended a briefing by the economic think tank Tasc.  Given we have the Taoiseach, Ministers, Deputies and Senators in line for a massive pay increase, to hear that Ireland is a more unequal society than ever is shameful.  These pay rises across the public sector only serve to increase economic inequality even more, and I welcome the Ministers' decision today to forego those increases.  While this was due to public pressure, it is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>Some may ask what this has to do with children and youth affairs.  Inequality inhibits a child's ability to flourish and creates a much lower level of well-being.  I will provide some of the facts that Tasc outlined and which ably demonstrate the consequences of inequality.  At nine months of age the household income has no impact on a child's cognitive potential.  By the age of three children in higher income families are, on average, performing better than those from lower income households.  A 1% increase in household income leads to a 5% percent increase in educational scores.  By age nine children from poorer backgrounds are aware of their class image and are more anxious, less happy and behave poorly.  This is directly attributed to the impact of multiple economic inequalities, for example, in housing, health, poverty, stress and education.  The saddest statistic I have heard recently is that by the age of 13, children's expectations are reduced because they recognise they are unequal.  Only 36% of children aged 13 from the bottom income group expect to get a college degree compared to 65% from the highest income group.<\/p> <p>The Ireland that our politicians have created today has a child deprivation rate of 36%, double the 2007 rate.  Some 58% of lone parents suffer deprivation, up from 35% in 2007.  Approximately 29% of our children are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, higher than the EU average and double that of Denmark.  In this, we are certainly not cherishing our children equally.<\/p> <p>There are some welcome measures.  I applaud and congratulate the Minister and her staff for getting this initiative off the ground.  The single affordable child care initiative is a welcome development and, hopefully, the starting point for all world-class provision for child care for all.  There is &euro;37 million in additional funding for Tusla, more teachers, more school meals and automatic medical cards for children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  While these are all positive measures, they need to be measured against the overall reality that is the structural inequality that exists in this country.<\/p> <p>Overall, I believe budget 2017 was an opportunity missed.  Like so many budgets that went before, it has far more capacity to create more inequality than it does to reduce it.  Inequality exists and gets worse because of political decisions taken by politicians who seem far removed from the day-to-day realities of people living, struggling and working in communities throughout the country.  This stems from an ideology of running down public services, reducing pay levels, creating poorly paid jobs and cheerleading for the markets and neoliberalism.  A way of addressing inequality is through equality-proofing budgets to investigate the outcomes of the decisions that politicians make.  This is committed to in the programme for Government, which states: \"We will develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights\".  It did not happen in this budget, unfortunately, but I hope it will happen in every budget from here on.<\/p> <p>I will conclude with one example and perhaps pose a direct question to the Minister on the area of social worker and social care staff recruitment.  What is the plan for these new staff?  Will they be employed directly by the HSE or will they be provided for by privatised agency companies, which seem to be everywhere and anywhere and seem to be taking over our public services?  Of the &euro;37 million promised to Tusla, how much of this extra funding will be swallowed up by private companies and basically lost?  The day the Minister made our citizens a commodity in the social care sector, to be bought and sold to the smallest bidder, was a sad day for the Proclamation that we try to live up to.  Until there is a day when the ideology of many who serve in both Houses changes, we will not see inequality reduced and we will continue to see it grow.  Sinn F&eacute;in and I have a different vision and we will see it through.  Nonetheless, on the whole, I congratulate the Minister yet again on this exciting initiative and wish her well in advancing and equality-proofing it.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#HH00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Senator Alice-Mary Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#HH00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It represents the first major admission by a Government that the cost of child care is extortionate and that widespread subsidies from the State are needed to support parents, particularly in low-income families.  It is the first major move in improving how we provide support for children.  I welcome the move to a child care subsidy system similar to that in place in Scandinavian countries which are near universally accepted as being among the best in the world.<\/p><p>As a lone parent, I spent my entire professional career struggling with high child care costs.  The subsidies announced last week will have a serious impact in making it easier for lone parents, in particular, to afford quality child care.  I broadly welcome the reforms, but I have a number of questions for the Minister about the practicalities of how they will work and wish to flag a number of issues which have been raised with me by various advocacy groups.<\/p><p>It seems the childcare employment and training support scheme and the after-school child care scheme which allow parents to return to education and work will end under the reforms.  I am someone who managed to get a degree before becoming a Senator and it was the fact that the after-school child care scheme was subsidised and I never had to pay more than &euro;25 a week that allowed me to get me where I am today.  Does this mean that the price cap under the schemes will end, thus allowing cr&egrave;ches to charge any price they see fit?  The child care sector has been relatively underfunded for a number of years and I have heard many concerns that the subsidies will be used to raise wages which should be increased for staff and that this could result in higher child care costs.  Is the Minister aware of these concerns and are measures in place to prevent it from being realised?<\/p><p>Lone parents in receipt of social welfare payments receive just under &euro;30 a week for their child.  It is not reasonable to assume that a lone parent receiving the one-parent family allowance or a jobseeker's transitional payment will be able to pay more than he or she receives in these payments for child care in order that he or she can access training.  Is the Minister aware that a potential impact of the reforms is preventing lone parents from returning to training?  Is she able to explain how this will be prevented?  It is certainly possible the reforms may be of use to lone parents who are working, but many lone parents rely on childminders as they are more affordable and can work more flexible hours.  Does the Minister have plans or initiatives to better support these parents?<\/p><p>I repeat my support for the general principles of the reforms.  The State needs to provide more financial support for parents who are struggling to meet the cost of child care.  I applaud the work of the Minister on the issue, but I would like to hear a response from her to my concerns.  I acknowledge that it was her vision and that of Ann Louise Gilligan for education and accessible child care that set the foundations for me to progress through the education system.  I ask that this be kept in mind when we look at labour activation measures.  Having caps is hugely important for someone who chooses not to go back into the labour market but who would like to use subsidised child care to return to education in order that he or she will not enter the labour market at the very bottom of the pile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#HH00500","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, and hope we will see her again as there are issues we might want to discuss about child poverty, child protection, parental leave, the provision of mental health supports for young people and youth services which are beyond youth activation and employment services in their more holistic sense.  I hope the Minister will be able to report to us on how we can ensure children will be reflected in equality proofing, not only in her Department but in others, for example, in the work of the Department of Social Protection and the area education where there are worrying signals that the children of bankers might have access to00 a special school, while other children struggle to access appropriate education services.  I am sure the Minister's will be a voice for equality for children in dealing with other Departments.<\/p> <p>In the limited time available to me I will focus on the single affordable child care scheme.  It is a milestone acknowledgement of the cost of child care in society.  Child care services are a piece of infrastructure that has been missing for many years in Irish society.  The scheme truly recognises the opportunities early years education provide for parents and children.  It is most welcome.  I also welcome some of the detail provided on the scheme.  I will not go into it now, but thought has been put into ensuring it addresses and supports not only those returning to work but all parents.  It is welcome that it links in from the age of six months when the period of maternity leave ends.  I particularly welcome and have strongly endorsed the fact that it is a publicly subsidised rather than a tax credit model.  One of the great strengths of the publicly subsidised model is that it allows the State, as a major stakeholder, to press for availability, affordability and quality.  <\/p> <p>I am concerned about some of the language used which is creeping in such as \"shopping around\" in the hope prices will happen to stay down.  There is a profit dynamic at work.  It is very important, therefore, that we look at capping.  I strongly urge the Minister, prior to September 2017, to consider introducing an appropriate capping mechanism that will support quality, proper pay, progression and decent equipment and recognise the real cost of child care as found by the Department and Early Childhood Ireland.  There should be capping in some form in order that there will be the capacity in the future to ensure we will be able to manage costs and, if there are major market players, that the profit component will not become unwieldy.  Capping is particularly important in schemes for those who most need predictable child care costs in the long term such as lone parents.<\/p> <p>We have spoken about pay and progression and the importance of securing year round contracts.  It is welcome that the Minister has addressed these issues.  In this regard, particular supports may be needed for community and voluntary schemes.  It is important, when we speak about getting the business model right, that we also get the service model right.  Ultimately, it is not just a new sector of the market, it is also a new service.  Thus far the Minister has shown courage to put forward this model.  I ask her to continue with this ambition to ensure we keep a public service, public ownership and accountability and a capping mechanism.<\/p> <p>I want to address some of the concerns we have heard in recent days.  It is very important that we say that for 60 years we have found things on which to spend money instead of child care services.  We have heard a plethora of new suggestions of things on which we might spend money instead of child care services, but we need to spend money on them.  This is absolutely appropriate.  Any new suggestion should be about affordable child care.  We have heard creative proposals about a tax credit.  I ask that we also examine the contributory model.  If we change the PRSI system, it will reward the grandmothers of Ireland because they will receive a pension that will reflect the years they put into child care.  This is a foundation for children and families on which many other supports and future investment will sit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#JJ00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I am delighted to join colleagues in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone.  This is the first time I have met her.  It is a pleasure to do so and I commend her very sincerely for the work she has done in recent weeks, including on the budget.<\/p> <p>I will declare my interest.  My wife is a Montessori teacher and we are in the process of trying to open a Montessori school in south County Dublin, but I assure the House this will have no bearing on what I say.  I wish to relay a few issues which have been raised with me since the announcement of the budget, ask one or two questions about the new scheme and discuss one or two issues which are not directly related but which come within the wider brief of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p> <p>When speaking about child care in general, particularly preschool education, young parents in my area consider various issues, of which cost is the biggest because if they cannot afford the child care service they want, they start to get angry and ask understandable questions.  Another issue is choice.  People want their child to go to a Montessori setting in the morning and attend a different after-school facility.  Therefore, they want choice and the services provided in the area to be balanced for all children, from birth to the age of 15 years.<\/p> <p>I have a query about the rules for what counts as net income.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Neale Richmond:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Clifford-Lee brought this up this as well.  Many people are wondering whether they will be covered.  Will the Minister, in her response or maybe at a later date, set out what is covered in term of net income and whether there are areas where there might be an element of flexibility, given that so many young parents are still feeling many of the after-effects of the years of austerity and, most importantly, the crash?<\/p><p>I think it was Senator Ruane who discussed at length after-school care, which is vitally important.  Much of the attention in previous years was not on after-school care.  A number of parents have raised with me over the past few months the fact they are committed to after-school care, they have the resources and they have the support necessary from the State but they do not have the actual facility.  They say there is a dearth of facilities, especially in south County Dublin, the area with which I am most familiar.  Montessori schools or cr&egrave;ches, which provide services in the morning, see obstacles laid out before them by the child care committee in adapting their facilities to after-school care facilities.  Can any measures be taken to open up property for this purpose?  Could more partnerships with other institutions, be they private or public, be considered to develop after-school facilities and the necessary sessions for parents, as their children go beyond their early years into their later years, up to the age of 15?<\/p><p>I welcome all the measures announced in the budget last week and wish the Minister every best with them.  They are greatly important.  I first started knocking on doors for Fine Gael in 2004.  Ever since then and in every election campaign I have canvassed or run in as a candidate, child care and its cost have been huge issues.  The vast majority of parents see the cost of child care as a second mortgage.  It is tough.  I very much welcome the area we are moving into and the initiatives announced last week, especially when many continental comparisons are considered.  The initiatives are very progressive and long overdue.  As I said, I started canvassing in 2004 so, in my mind, they are at least 12 years overdue.  I, therefore, commend the Minister on everything that has gone into the budget.<\/p><p>The second matter to which I refer has absolutely nothing to do with the recent announcements but it comes under the Minister's remit.  I have raised the matter on the Order of Business previously, in different places and in different debates, even just last week.  I refer to Erasmus+ and the drawdown in Ireland in respect of the scheme.  In 2015, 150 out of 243 Irish applications, or just over 60%, were successful.  That is a pretty good figure, but 243 applications in the first place is disappointingly low.  L&eacute;argas, the agency that runs Erasmus+, and the HEA, which partners with it, ran 28 clinics for organisations looking to apply for Erasmus+ in 2015.  This shows that when applications are completed, they are put through.  However, in a previous life, I spent far too many hours compiling and filling out Erasmus+ application forms.  I think the record was 111 pages; the shortest form I ever completed was 57 pages long.  I ask the Minister, therefore, if at a European Council level, she will put the case to the Commission that we are simply not making the most of great programmes, such as Erasmus+.  The application and reporting process needs to be simplified greatly.  The whole system could be improved.  I ask the Department to make efforts to improve this, bearing in mind that many times when Irish organisations and bodies were successful in their applications, it was through partnering with organisations in the UK.  We need to fill that gap post-Brexit and I ask the Minister to take my comments to the Council and the Commission and to look for greater simplicity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#JJ00300","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to the House.  It is a pleasure to have her here in her new role, on which I congratulate her.  I would like to say how good it was to work with her in the Seanad in the previous term.  I congratulate her also on the single affordable child care scheme, which received a very positive response generally.  Other colleagues raised various issues and asked questions about it, and I hope to speak about and focus on it too.<\/p> <p>However, before I do so, I wish to raise with the Minister two issues that also relate to her brief, given that is the focus of this debate.  The first is the urgency of commencing the Children First legislation.  This was raised by the organisation One in Four last week.  The Act introduces mandatory reporting for a range of professionals.  We did a good deal of work on it in the justice committee, as the Minister will recall, so we should not lose sight of it.  Sometimes legislation, as the Minister will be aware, particularly in the area of children, has been passed but then it languishes on the Statute Book for many years before it is commenced, so it is something we need to watch.<\/p> <p>Second, I raise with her the recommendations of the UN rapporteurs to Ireland on the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child earlier this year, which were discussed at the First Child Summit.  Some of the issues they raised were also raised in the book published by the ESRI, which the Minister launched in recent weeks, based on the Growing Up in Ireland study, which contained some disturbing findings on the expectations of children in contemporary Ireland.  We find children's well-being in contemporary Ireland still being largely shaped by parental circumstance and social and economic position.  I know the Minister is well aware of the data on that, but it has also been raised at international level in the context of the number of children living in consistent poverty and the growing number of homeless children.  In that context, I also raise with her the condition of children living in direct provision settings and ask her to bring her influence to bear on the Government in the implementation at least of the Mahon report recommendations on improving conditions for families and children, in particular, in direct provision.  Those recommendations were put forward during the term of the last Government, but it is disappointing that they have not been given more focus in the lifetime of the current Government.<\/p> <p>I refer to the UN rapporteurs' focus on the issue of divestment.  They raised the following question, which has been raised in other forums and at international and national level.  How does the religious patronage of schooling, currently more than 90% of our primary schools, impact on children, specifically children of non-Christian families and children who were maybe brought up in families with no designated religion?  There has been a very disappointing lack of progress on the policy of divestment originally announced by the former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, but which we have seen languish.  I speak as somebody who was very involved in the starting up a multidenominational school, under Educate Together patronage, which had formerly been a Catholic school.  We were very involved in one of the first divestments in my area of the south inner city Dublin, but it has been very disappointing that so few further divestments have taken place.  Again, I know this is not directly in the Minister's area - it clearly comes under the Department of Education and Skills - but it has been raised in the context of children's rights at international level.  Again, I ask her to bring her influence to bear within Cabinet on that.<\/p> <p>Child care is an issue in which many of us are very personally invested.  Senator Richmond referred to it.  As a parent of young children, who has paid for child care and has sought it for children for some years, I know personally the very direct personal impact that the Minister's scheme will have, and I very much welcome it.  As I said, it has been broadly welcomed.  We are relatively unique in Ireland in that we have extremely high child care costs for parents and very low levels of State investment traditionally.  Others have spoken about this.  Clearly, one must consider women's role in society in Ireland generally to understand why so little focus has been paid politically to child care over the years.  I, therefore, very much welcome the renewed focus in this regard, but we must see it in a gendered context.  The Minister will be very well aware of this and of the language in Article 41 of our Constitution which recognises mothers as having duties in the home exclusively - there is no reference to fathers - and women as having a life within the home.  We need to move beyond that.  I hope we will see the removal of that language from the Constitution and its replacement, as the Constitutional Convention recommended, with gender-neutral language respecting the role of carers.<\/p> <p>As the Minister said, it is also important we ensure the measures she has announced are not seen in some way to discriminate against parents who do not work outside the home.  There has been an unfortunate tendency to pit mothers against one another, when in fact we should all seek the same thing.  Of course, increasing the quality and value of early child care and education and allowing parents to spend significant amounts of time at home are not mutually exclusive, and we can achieve a model where both are valued and parents' choices and children's rights are emphasised and given priority.  Generally, we tend to look to the Scandinavian model of family-friendly work policies, such as parental and paternity leave, alongside publicly subsidised early years facilities for all.  We see an emphasis in this model on parental choice and children's rights.  Parents are enabled to remain at home for at least the first year of a child's life and policies are adopted on a gender-neutral basis.  This applies in countries that have a much larger tax base than, and a very different tax system from, ours, and we need to be cognisant of that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the Labour Party we recently heard from Ciair&iacute;n de Buis, the former director of Start Strong, who has advocated that we look to other countries too, not just Scandinavia but also New Zealand, for example.  There is a tax base similar to ours in New Zealand which is not as developed as that in Scandinavia.  It set out a reforming early years strategy some time ago, placing a particular emphasis on high levels of qualifications of the workforce in early childhood education.  I wish to specifically refer to this.  In the Labour Party's child care policy during the last general election entitled, \"Standing up for Families\", we emphasised the need to invest in high-quality child care, not just to reduce the cost to parents.  We called for the placing of a cap on child care costs for parents to reduce them to no more than &euro;2 per hour by 2021.  Coupled with this, we also called for an increase in the quality of child care settings by ensuring the greater professionalisation of those working in early childhood education.  I know that the Minister has asked specifically for Senators' view on the investment of resources.  That is one area in which we could really do with an investment of resources.  We know that staff in the child care sector generally tend to be low paid and, until relatively recently, low levels of qualifications were required.  We called in our policy for a transforming of quality by ensuring a higher premium for providers with highly qualified staff.  I know that this is being started.  It was started under the previous Government and we also started to enhance inspection rates of pre-school facilities.  Again, we could do a lot more in that regard.<\/p><p>I argue for a distinction to be made between child care and early childhood education.  We need to ensure we talk about early childhood education specifically.  It is extremely formative and important for the development of children.  It must be separate from, although closely related to, child care.  All in all, we need to ensure we are reconceptualising early childhood care and education in terms of children's rights in line with the constitutional amendment brought forward by the previous Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#KK00200","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach seo um thrathn&oacute;na.

I wish her well in her brief and compliment her on her achievements to date in this area and the manner in which she has been able to persuade her Fine Gael Cabinet colleagues to travel on the road on which she has taken them.<\/p> <p>Many points have been raised by my colleagues.  I am not going to go into them again and will try to curtail my contribution mainly to questions.  <\/p> <p>I have a couple of concerns, the first of which is the &euro;47,000 net income figure.  Was a more tiered approach looked at?  What is the relevance of the figure of &euro;47,000?  I am thinking primarily of those who are earning in excess of that sum and the fact that they will lose out.  Was any consideration given to having a tiered, stepped salary scale initiative rather than using this method?  <\/p> <p>My second concern is Tusla-registered child care providers, of whom there is a limited number.  How do we encourage more child care providers to register with Tusla?  What are the road blocks in that regard?  <\/p> <p>The other issue is the demand for places that one imagines will follow this initiative of the Minister.  Are we happy that we have the infrastructure in place to accommodate the anticipated demand?<\/p> <p>The final issue is the challenge we face everyday in our lives in achieving a work-life balance.  It is the parent's choice to stay at home as opposed to feeling he or she would like to go out or has to go out to work.  How can we ensure the two ideals are met and seen as genuine goals?  I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on how can we look after both those sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#LL00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I wish to deal specifically with issues affecting the LGBTQI community, young people in particular.  In June, during the Dublin Pride weekend, the Minister's Department announced that it would lead the development of Ireland's first national LGBT strategy for young people.  A more suitable weekend could not have been found.  The LGBT Ireland report identified the very real struggles young people faced in post-marriage equality Ireland.  It outlined for us, as elected representatives, activists, politicians and Ministers, a very clear understanding of issues facing young LGBTQI people such as mental health, self-harm, suicide, coming out, school experiences, substance abuse and misuse, victimisation and harassment.  Compared to the national youth mental health study commissioned by UCD and Headstrong, among LGBT young people there is twice the level of self-harm, three times the level of attempted suicide and four times the level of severe stress, anxiety and depression.  I take the opportunity to welcome the undertaking of a national LGBT strategy and express my commitment to support its development.  It is fair to say the Minister and I share the common goal of making it easier to grow up as someone who is LGBT.<\/p><p>Will the Minister provide an update on the strategy and the ongoing proposals following the budget announcements last week?  Will she indicate a timeline for such developments?  Will all LGBTQI organisations engaged with young people, including ShoutOut and BeLonGTo, be involved or consulted in its development?  It is of the utmost importance that moneys be ring-fenced for implementation of the strategy, rather than just its development.  Will that be the case?  I ask because, as things stand, support services for persons who are LGBTQI are stretched to the limit in post-marriage equality Ireland.  Following the passing of the referendum ensuring greater trans equality, young people are availing of BeLonGTo's services in increasing numbers.  It is wonderful, heartwarming and heartening to know that young people are coming out in greater numbers, engaging in LGBT community services, seeking peer to peer support, sexual health support, mental health support and support for those misusing drugs and alcohol.  The LGBT community, BeLonGTo and ShoutOut are engaging with young people, empowering them and building a sense of their being part of the LGBT community earlier than ever.  In other words - the Minister will accept this - they are transforming lives and we know that that work is lifesaving.  In the LGBT Ireland report the average age at which young people to discover their identity is 12 years and the average age at which they come out is 16.  That space of four years cannot be spent in isolation or on the margins.  Any LGBT strategy for young people must make dealing with that issue a priority.<\/p><p>Last week I was sent correspondence from a young trans person who attended BeLonG To's service.  I do not read it to engage in political point-scoring but to stress the importance of, as we know well, the empowering ability of youth services.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>Yesterday young people attending BeLonG To's Sunday group were notified of some changes that would take place in the service, caused by a dramatic increase in attendance since the marriage referendum and a distinct lack of funding despite this increase.  As this service has been put under strain, they are reducing the groups to once every 2 weeks, as opposed to have meetings every week as they have done for years prior.  They are also having to close their largest group (the Sunday group) to over 18s.  They've had to remove their informal hang-out group, &quot;Drop in&quot;, entirely.  Even before this announcement, BeLonG To's own building is not substantial to accommodate their 2 biggest groups, and the building is not wheelchair accessible.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The e-mail continues:<\/p><blockquote>As vulnerable LGBTQI teenagers and young adults we need our weekly groups.

We should depart from the review and open a legal pathway for young transgender people prior to it even commencing.  In a sense, there is nothing to review in respect of young transgender people.  Their existence was a glaring omission in the legislation.  Will the Minister ensure that the voices of transgender citizens not heard in the review form part of the membership of any new group?  A review undertaken by cisgender individuals is deeply problematic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#LL00300","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>In a previous life, I worked in the UK for ten years as a child care campaigner turned politician and, therefore, the Minister and I may share common ground.  The budget breakthrough in 2017 was phenomenal and only somebody who has worked in the sector and who has seen what happens behind the scenes could judge that.  I commend the breakthrough because, as Senator Higgins said, child care is part of the infrastructure of a modern Ireland for children.  In 2002, when I was living in England, I was part of an OECD team that visited Ireland and what we found was shocking in terms of how far behind Ireland was in respect of child care.  It is great that in 2016 and 2017 we are finally catching up.<\/p> <p>The Minister has inherited a messy, complicated and expensive child care system in which the positive changes she makes could have unintended consequences, as has been outlined.  I offer the support and expertise of the Civil Engagement group to wade through that messy and complicated system and for us to be her critical friends as the child care system that is needed is developed.  The only measure of success will be a reduction in child poverty rates.  The current rates are unacceptable and they keep going in the wrong direction.  Any activity in child care provision should have a positive effect on child poverty by reducing it.  It should also close the 14% gender gap in order that we end up with an infrastructure that supports women and children to succeed in Ireland.

Having worked with her on many different battles during the previous D&aacute;il, she brings passion and zeal to the job and we are lucky to have her in this post.<\/p> <p>I refer to Senator Warfield's remarks regarding BeLonGTo, LGBT young people and, in particular, the transgender community.  Everybody thought with the passage of the Gender Recognition Act, the issue had been resolved but we have a huge quantum of work to do still and based on my own observations of, and interactions with, the LGBT community, we have work to do on youth services.  I commend BeLongTo on its work under the leadership of Ms Monnine Griffith.  It is a path we have to work on and bring many people on a journey with us.  The Senator's point is well made.  I met members of the transgender community in the context of the gender recognition legislation and I am sure in time we will examine a pathway for people to transition.   I am probably using the wrong language and I apologise for that but it is an area of huge sensitivity.  Given the work of TENI and BeLonGTo, as an office holder, the Minister has to be cognisant of the fragility of life.  The essence of what we are discussing in this context is giving people a new beginning and a new opportunity in life.<\/p> <p>Equally, the Minister visited Cork ETB a few weeks ago to showcase youth work.  Participants at the event were struck by her commitment and genuine interest, and by the time she took with different young people.  We are lucky as a society to have a youth network that puts a value on young people and offers them a different life in some cases.  The network makes them feel safe, secure, welcome and involved and a confidence is given to them that they might not experience in their own family life or in their life outside the network.  We have been fortunate with youth work provision.  I hope in the coming years a youth work blueprint will be produced to build on the work of For&oacute;ige and other organisations.  While there are organised sporting, cultural and youth clubs, including the scouts and girl guides, we need to impress on each other and on the wider community the importance of youth work and of building bridges with young people to make them feel part of a community.  I hope that will be done.<\/p> <p>Senator Kelleher referred to the budget breakthrough and she is correct.  Senator Higgins raised the infrastructure of life for young people on the Order of Business and child care is part of that.  As former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I fully recognise the importance and the need for a blueprint and the need to give families a tax break to make child care affordable.  Much of the commentary on the budget has dealt with different issues.  Grandparents and stay-at-home parents mind children but in some families both parents must work and a balance must be struck because affordable, quality child care is necessary while child care providers and their staff must earn an income that is commensurate with the work they do when our young children are entrusted to them.<\/p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to refer to the importance of the Togher Family Centre, which I have discussed with the Minister, and the issues the staff there have raised with me.  They need to be able to continue to provide quality child care for families in the area and they would like more funding.  Senator Clifford-Lee will also work hard in her area in this regard.  In the Togher case, services need to be extended, not reduced.  It must be ensured the changes in regulation, which we all accept must be in place, do not create difficulties for these family centres and result in a reduction in service.  I invite the Minister to visit Togher Family Centre because it a hive of activity.  It is a wonderful centre where young people are treated as family, and loved and cared for.  They adopt wonderful departures from the norm in terms of child care.  It is a centre of excellence that deserves our commendation and praise.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister on the budget she has managed to secure, which is welcome.  We must all work to ensure child care and youth work continues to be represented at the Cabinet table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#MM00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#NN00050","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chair.

I would like to express my deep appreciation for all of the contributions from all of the Senators and the care with which they prepared those.  Clearly, I can feel their appreciation for what I am trying to do and it means a lot.  As we have said a few times, I believe we are taking a radical new step to ensure the support and the sustainability in the way we care for and value our children in whatever setting that happens.  It is extremely helpful in making such a significant step forward to receive the support of Senators, as well as their critical questions, some of which I will try to address now.  As the questions have been wide-ranging, I may not reach them all but Ms Bernie McNally, my assistant secretary, is in the Chamber and is taking note of the questions.  If I do not reach all of them we will be willing to provide those answers in written form.<\/p> <p>I have heard some of the ways Senators have identified that what we are trying to do is actually to rethink or re-conceptualise the ways in which we provide, understand and resource the care and education of our children and young people.  We are trying to recognise the cost of care in a different way than we did before and to ensure greater work-life balance, which is absolutely critical.  Above all - I believe many Senators have commented on this - I refer to the way in which changes are made in the additional investment I have managed to secure for children and young people.  I will refer to some of the Senators' remarks on youth services as I conclude, but particularly on the child care scheme.  The plan is an attempt to ensure additional investment in children for their future.  It is not in any way an effort to discriminate against families.  As many Members have stated, it is an effort, in a new way, to highly value the care that is provided by all parents, relatives, grandparents and the way in which we balance the valuing of all who are caring for children.  While this is a general response to some of the Senators' appreciation and comments in the overall approach I have taken, I will now turn to some of the more specific questions.<\/p> <p>Senator Clifford-Lee raised the issue of Garda vetting.  We are working very closely with the national vetting bureau to decrease the time it takes so we can ensure that organisations have access to child care professionals as soon they are required.  I have already indicated I am committed to that and I have already begun to prepare for budget 2018.  Coming up to budget 2017, I said that were we to approach the budgetary provision for the investment in child care and early years learning in a manner approaching the average of OECD countries, Ireland would need to invest at least &euro;100 million over the next five years.  This year, coming into the 2017 budget, the provision was &euro;121 million so I would need to get at least that much - if not more - for 2018.<\/p> <p>As we move into 2017, one great thing is the way in which the Department operates with city and county child care committees, with public representatives and with child care providers themselves, especially with the national early years forum I established recently to work closely with me in monitoring the implementation of the changes we have identified.  The Department is always doing that and we are consistently evaluating the impact of the change to see if it needs to be tweaked further.<\/p> <p>Questions were also asked about the various entry points, particularly the age levels with regard to the ECCE entry points.  That in itself was an effort to respond to a situation where a child might miss an entry level point for a whole year due to their birth date.  That is why we established those three entry points.  I hear that concern and I know the officials are hearing that too.  There are still some questions and concerns around that and we will look at those.<\/p> <p>Senators asked for clarification around the early child care scheme and what net income actually means.  It means net income from households, whether assessed individually or jointly.  We will consider that.  The good thing about the scheme I have introduced is that as it will not be implemented until September 2017, we have time to prepare and to continue to deal with questions and concerns.  I will also ask my officials to revert to the Senators about whether income from a property which is in negative equity will be assessed.<\/p> <p>Senator Noone spoke about how the issue of the cost of child care was often raised on the doorsteps.  The election was not that long ago -although in some ways it seems like a lifetime ago and I can tell Members I never expected to be sitting in this chair - and the cost of child care was raised consistently during that election campaign.  Senator Noone also made reference to the Growing Up in Ireland survey.  I had a great privilege of launching the ESRI compilation.  I believe Senator Devine may have also referred to that in her remarks with regard to analysing the Growing Up in Ireland study and the analysis of some of the meaning of the data from the past ten years, so much of which has to do with issues of inequality and how we are going to address those across the board as a Government.<\/p> <p>With regard to my Department and this particular scheme, it is an attempt to address the issue of inequality for children in a way that has not been done before and to do it in a systematic way that can be built on over time.  I believe some of the questions have to do with the numbers of children who would benefit from the new approach.  There are some 31,000 children currently benefitting from the existing schemes.  We have checked the new scheme against these and we know that 95% of those children will actually be better off.  We have made provision to ensure that the balance of 5% will maintain their existing level of benefit or subsidy when the scheme is introduced.  My Department will be actively monitoring the cost to ensure that the top-up payment by parents does remain manageable.  Senators Higgins, Ruane and others raised the issue of fees and the capping of fees.  I am very much aware of the importance of looking at this because I too am concerned about the fees issue.<\/p> <p>As the Senators are aware, this affordable scheme is about making decisions on where to put the limited resources - even though I was able to get a significant amount for September 2017 - how to allocate those resources and in what places, while having regard to affordability, quality and accessibility.  In addition, the issue I have heard so clearly, having worked with people in the sector for most of my life in the country, concerns the professionals and practitioners who work within the sector.  The importance of investing in staff is related to the issue of fees.  In 2017 we are also investing &euro;14.5 million in respect of the professionals and the practitioners in the centres, to provide additional moneys for non-contact time and for the learner fund to increase their levels of qualifications.  We have raised the capitation beyond what it was and have related it to the access to qualifications, in addition to restoring all levels of capitation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Katherine Zappone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2392\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2392&amp;amp;pid=KatherineZappone&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are ways in which we are spending some of the money to support providers.<\/p><p>The issue of fees is being examined.  One of the ways of addressing concerns in that regard is to ensure investment in the professionals as they develop.  On the capping of fees, a point raised by Senator Higgins and others, the pros and cons of doing that will be considered in the context of the independent review that will commence towards the end of this year.  I am aware that it is not expected that in 2017 demand will outstrip supply and as such it is not anticipated that fees will necessarily be raised.  I hope they will not.  I have talked about the ways in which we are trying to be proactive in terms of ensuring that does not happen.  Members will be aware from other commentary that capacity is expected to expand in 2018 in light of the capital and subsidisation supports.  We will be looking at this issue in the context, in particular, of 2018 with the hope that in 2017, in light of the way in which we have moved in terms of investing in this sector, fees will not increase.  <\/p><p>There were a couple of questions on the scheme, including whether it replaces the current four subsidisation schemes operated by the Department.  The answer is \"Yes\".  First and foremost the single affordable child care scheme is to amalgamate the four schemes into one and to, above all, make it easier and more user-friendly for providers and parents to understand in terms of how their child care requirements may be subsidised.  The subsidisation scheme is particularly for afterschool care, which was a concern of Senator Ruane.  Effectively, this subsidisation will provide for wrap-around care for afterschool care for children of preschool age and for all children aged up to 15 years.  The purpose of the subsidisation is largely to enable that support.  The free preschool places scheme also forms part of that support.<\/p><p>I would like to assure Senator Devine that I am very much aware of the programme for Government commitment in terms of equality and gender-proofing of budgets.  It is an initiative I brought to the programme for Government.  I hope this process will be in place in my Department post-2017.  I will be encouraging the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and the independent office to ensure that process is ready to go for 2018. <\/p><p>I have visited many parts of the country to see what is being done in terms of youth services.  I am delighted to say that the additional &euro;5.5 million being provided for 2017 will enable me to ensure an increase of up to 10% in funding for youth organisations.  I am aware there are some national youth organisations that are not part of this scheme.  I hope there may be ways to include some of them in terms of the moneys available.  I am well aware of the good work of BeLonGTo and I have received communication on the manner in which it has had to cut back on services because of cuts.  On the point made by Senator Buttimer in regard to youth services in his area, funding for this sector has been increased.  We will look carefully at how best to ensure it goes to support the extraordinary work being done in terms of youth services provision throughout the country and, in particular, to ensure the service is better represented in terms of geographic regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#NN00300","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Gallagher, asked if consideration had been given to income progression and stepping down the support for people that are over the &euro;47,500 net income threshold.

Some of the questions in that regard come in the absence of people understanding how the new scheme will impact their particular family.  Subsidisation will differ according to the age, number and supervision requirements of children, as well as what is accounted for in terms of net income.  A great deal of consideration went into the setting of the threshold at &euro;47,500.  Obviously, the subsidisation decreases as one moves up the threshold but the threshold was set to ensure it captured people in the lower and middle income brackets.  It is important to ensure affordability in that regard.  One of the priorities is to keep the money towards the lower end.  It will become more apparent as time goes by how this will impact families in their own particular circumstance.  This is just a first step on a new path.  I am determined to look for ways to ensure that we can increase this funding in years to come.  This scheme has been well thought out.  It is research based and evidence based such that it will be the most targeted and efficient way to value caring for our children in all contexts and thus supporting all families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#OO00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#OO00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1476797400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016101800002#OO00500","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1476797400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 6.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 October 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
