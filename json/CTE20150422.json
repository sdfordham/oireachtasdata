Doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 19th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  As these committees proceed, the cold shadow of the banking and financial crisis can still be felt and seen in every corner of Ireland, yet we do not have a full picture of the events leading up to and during and after the crisis, and gaps still remain in our knowledge of that time.  It is this committee's responsibility to unearth those missing pieces and to put them together.  In commencing the Nexus Phase of the inquiry, I want to welcome members of the public watching our proceedings live this morning.  You will have the opportunity to hear, at first-hand, from those who were involved in one of the major events in the history of our country.  You will be able to see and hear from them as they are questioned and give their evidence to this committee.  This inquiry has been set up to serve you, the Irish people, to get the answers and questions about the crisis and to ensure that a crisis of this nature is never revisited upon the Irish people again.  As a committee we intend to fulfil that duty for you.<\/p> <p>  The Context Phase of the inquiry, which has just completed, served a purpose.  It set out the background of the crisis and has prepared the ground for the Nexus Phase of public hearings, which start today.  During this phase, the committee will engage with institutions and individuals who had central roles during the crisis period.  This represents a significant step up in activity and responsibility for all, both the committee and the banking inquiry team, which is working behind the scenes.  It will focus upon three broad elements: banking systems and practices; regulatory and supervisory systems and practices; and crisis management systems and policy responses, and how these three elements interacted with each other.  It will identify and analyse all evidence and produce a final report in November.<\/p> <p>  We know we are facing into a huge task with over 64 public hearings ahead of us and we will be hearing from over 50 witnesses during that time, along with receiving witness statements.  The inquiry has sought and received nearly 40,000 documents to date, amounting to hundreds of thousands of pages.  This is the first time that all of the key documents over this period have been collated and examined in one place at one time.  The real strength of the inquiry is its ability not to look at one document in isolation but to draw together the various strands and various sources along with the key public testimony to get a better picture of what happened to put in place the pieces of that jigsaw.<\/p><p>While public hearings with witnesses are televised and webcast live, these are only part of the process.  Much of the joint committee's work is less visible to the public.  A parliamentary inquiry is a complex project, requiring significant behind-the-scenes work to support the public hearings leading to the final report, and in this regard I would like to thank the secretariat and investigators for their work they have done to date and will continue to do so on behalf of this inquiry.<br\/><br\/>Now I just want to address a number of matters to the media who are very, very welcome to our hearings and proceedings this morning.  We recognise and appreciate the important role you've played and continue to play in these proceedings and coverage and reporting of these proceedings is of confidential information which can impair the working inquiry, and in that regard I just want to explain a number of matters.  As part of our hearings and to facilitate them, you will be afforded with an opportunity to see some of the documentation displayed in this room which will be up on the monitors as the proceeding is actually taking place.  The also, these ... it should be recognised though that this is to facilitate the reporting and these documents are not being published by the committee at this stage and are not for publication in that regard, so I just want to draw your attention to the restrictions and constraints on reporting under section 41 of the new Act, which creates an offence of publishing confidential documents or their content regardless of how the documents are acquired but in facilitating the proceedings this morning these documents will be displayed.  I'm sure that you share our desire that the integrity of the inquiry is maintained and that it is successful in addressing the reasons Ireland experienced the banking crisis and that this will be reflected in your own reporting of proceedings today.<br\/><br\/>Finally I'd like to thank, take this opportunity to thank all the committee members for their hard work and commitment in getting to this stage.  The fact we completed the context phase and are now starting the Nexus Phase on schedule reflects the co-operative and positive response and approach that the committee has adopted in how we set about our work and how we have worked as a team.  A responsibility now rests on the shoulders of the members of this committee.  It is the first committee to carry out its work under the new legislation, and has been entrusted to examine one of the major events in the history of the State, and a crisis which has impacted upon every household in Ireland.  Only by having a complete picture of what happened can we learn lessons and apply these lessons into the future; only then can we move on as a nation, when confident that a crisis like this will never be revisited upon us all again. <br\/><br\/>So with that said, our witnesses today are Mr. Frank Daly, chairman, and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, CEO of NAMA. Mr.  Frank Daly was appointed as chairman of the National Asset Management Agency by the Minister for Finance in December 2009.  He also currently chairs the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee and previous to his NAMA appointment has served as a public interest director of the Irish ... of Anglo Irish Bank under the banks guarantee scheme and chairman of the commission of taxation which was established to review the structure and efficiency of the Irish taxation system.  From 1963 to 2008 he worked in the Revenue Commissioners, becoming a commissioner in 1996 and then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  He was appointed to the position on 5 May 2009 by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan.  From 1994 to 2009 he worked with the National Treasury Management Agency where he was financial controller and later director of finance, technology and risk.  Previously he worked for a number of years with the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland, ESB, in a number of areas.  Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh you're very welcome in front of the inquiry this morning. <br\/><br\/>Now to commence with some of the formal proceedings and, in doing so, I would like to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you're directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter and time frame of this inquiry; and I will then, on that basis, advise the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings which I spoke about.<br\/><br\/>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens, as I have mentioned here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery those documents will be displayed on the screen to your left.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not be published ... they should not be publishing any of the documents so displayed.  The witnesses have been directed to attend this meeting of the joint inquiry into the banking crisis, and you will be furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee which will be relied upon now in questioning and form part of the evidence of the final inquiry itself.<\/p><p> I will ask the Clerk to administer the oath of affirmation to you, Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#B00100","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429657200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The following witnesses were sworn in by the Clerk to the Committee:\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Daly, Chairman, National Asset Management Agency\r\n\r\nMr. Brendan McDonagh, Chief Executive Officer, National Asset Management Agency<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

In this brief opening statement you have asked me to address five topics in particular: the acquisition process of eligible assets from participating institutions; the quality of documentation underlying collateral of acquired assets; the governance models in place in respect of loan and asset acquisition and management; the asset valuation methodologies utilised by the participating institutions prior to acquisition as compared to that used by NAMA; and the extent of commercial diligence conducted by borrowers.<\/p> <p>  Before addressing these points directly, I wish to emphasise that my comments are informed largely by NAMA's experience of acquiring a management portfolio of loans with a face value of &euro;74 billion acquired from the participating institutions in 2010 and 2011 for a consideration of &euro;31.8 billion.  Regarding some of the points on which you have asked me to comment, I do not and could not have the level of detailed knowledge or insight that would be available to senior lending managers or to the credit committees of the financial institutions or to staff of the Financial Regulator or the Central Bank. <\/p> <p>  By the time of NAMA's establishment, the property lending crisis and the losses created by poor lending decisions were already irreversible, and while in this statement I may draw certain inferences about the causes of these losses based on what we found when we acquired the loans, I do not claim to have access to the full picture.  In particular, as I was outside the banking system, I do not have an insight into the motivation behind the poor lending decisions of the financial institutions or indeed the borrowing decisions of the debtors in the years up to the end of 2008.  I trust Chairman and committee members, you will accept my comments in that spirit.<\/p> <p>  The acquisition process has been described in detail in the Comptroller and Auditor General's first special report on NAMA acquisition of bank assets, which was published in 2010.  The key elements of the process are outlined below.  The institutions were required to identify assets which were eligible for transfer by reference to criteria in the NAMA Act 2009 and in regulations made by the Minister of Finance in December 2009, and subsequently in March 2010.  They were also requested to provide detailed information on their eligible loans, including legal due diligence reports and up-to-date valuations of the property and other assets which were placed as collateral for these loans.  The reference date for the market valuation of property was 30 November 2009.<\/p> <p>  NAMA then went through a process of validating key information provided by the financial institutions.  Legal due diligence reports submitted by the institutions were reviewed by NAMA's external legal panel.  The reviews were required to highlight any issues which gave rise to legal difficulties for NAMA in managing the loans or engaging in enforcement actions in respect of them.  Particular attention was paid to enforceability of security, any deficiencies in title to property and the implications of such deficiencies.<\/p> <p>  The valuation process also covered property valuations supplied by the institutions.  A key element in the valuation of each loan was the current market value of the property or other collateral securing the loan.  The valuation was, in the first place, provided by a professional property valuer commissioned by the financial institution but also owing a duty of care to NAMA.  Each property valuation submitted by the financial institution was referred by NAMA to its own property valuation panel which reviewed it and provided an opinion as to whether it considered it to be correct or not.  If the NAMA property panel disagreed with the valuation it was referred to an independent property valuer for adjudication.  This third party property valuation was accepted by NAMA and used as part of the loan valuation.<\/p> <p>  The valuation methodology used to value bank assets, usually loans, but also including derivatives, had to receive the formal approval of the European Commission because there was an element of state aid incorporated into the transfer price.  Bank assets were acquired at an acquisition value which is determined in line Part 5 of the NAMA Act and the valuation regulations made by the Minister and published in March 2010.<\/p><p>The acquisition value of each bank asset was its long-term economic value.  Various factors were taken into account in the calculation of the long-term economic value, including the current market value of the security, typically property but also including non-property assets, such as shares etc., and in the case of property, its long-term economic value.  The valuation regulations required that NAMA apply an uplift adjustment factor ranging from 0% to 25% to the current market value of property to reflect its long-term economic value.<\/p><p> Following completion of the property and legal due diligence processes, a loan-by-loan valuation was carried out by one of five loan valuation firms employed by NAMA.  The loan valuation process was independently audited by KPMG, which acted as audit co-ordinator.  The audit co-ordinator provided audit certification to the European Commission on the valuations ... that the valuations were in line with the methodology approved by them.  By 2014, the Commission had confirmed its approval of the transfer of all nine loan tranches.  Ultimately, of the &euro;31.8 billion NAMA paid as consideration for the acquired loans, &euro;5.6 billion was considered to be state aid, i.e. NAMA paid the financial institutions &euro;5.6 billion more than the private sector market would have paid them at the time of acquisition.<\/p><p> I understand that one of the earlier contributors to this inquiry made a comment to the effect that NAMA acquired loans at rock bottom prices.  This suggestion, frankly, does not bear much scrutiny.  I have mentioned already the overpayment of the state aid element of &euro;5.6 billion in acquisition price.  In addition, NAMA's acquired loans were valued by reference to a property collateral date of 30 November 2009 and, as a result, NAMA had to absorb losses from the impact of a 25% to 30% decline in Irish property values which took place subsequently right up to the end of 2013.  No private investor would have transacted on this basis, i.e. a private investor would have paid only on the basis of the market price at close to the actual dates of the loan transfers in 2010 and 2011; thus if the participating institutions had to sell to private investors, I estimate that the acquisition price would probably be reduced by another &euro;4.5 billion.  Essentially, therefore, the institutions would have been paid about &euro;22 billion by the market rather than the &euro;32 billion that NAMA did pay for the loans.<\/p><p> Incidentally, I gather that the same contributor expressed the opinion that NAMA was acting more like a debt collection agency than as a property value maximising entity, and apparently questioning our ethos in that respect.  I think this reflects a poorly informed view of NAMA although I understand that the contributor indicated that it was only an impression that he had.  Of course NAMA collects debts, as would any similar entity.  We collect on the loans due to us, indeed this is due to the taxpayers, but our role has been much broader and much more positive than that. <\/p><p> To give you a sense of the scale of NAMA&rsquo;s role in the market since the end March 2010, NAMA has acted to stimulate market activity by disposing of close to &euro;6 billion in Irish property since inception, involving over 20,000 individual property transactions.  We have worked hard to bring foreign investors to the Irish market.  We have injected &euro;1 billion in capital to support the development of viable Irish projects which will continue to enhance the value of the underlying assets.  We provided a vendor finance programme for commercial property lending at a time when the banks had stopped lending on Irish property.  We set up a price protection scheme which addressed the concern about falling prices on the part of purchasers; the scheme involved a deferral of 20% of the cost of a residential purchase for five years.  A further &euro;3 billion is available in development funding, some of which will help fund the initiatives in the Dublin residential property market and also the docklands SDZ.  We have worked assiduously to enhance planning permissions and to remove other obstacles to the development of assets so as to enhance their value and to ensure that they are shovel ready as soon as possible.  By end 2015 we expect to have made 2,000 residential units available for social housing and we have supported businesses whose debt we acquired to employ about 15,000 people.<\/p><p> All of this work requires an intensive commitment by us in terms of time and resources involving experienced staff brought together from a wide range of disciplines for this unique asset management challenge.  All in all, Chairman, I would suggest that well informed commentators would not regard these activities as those of an agency solely concerned with debt collection. <\/p><p> The legal due diligence process involved the submission by the participating institutions of comprehensive legal due diligence reports which included the disclosure of any matter which could materially affect the value of either the loan or the underlying security for the loan.  NAMA retained the panel of legal advisers to review legal due diligence reports and report on the disclosures made and other matters not disclosed.  In particular, their expertise was focused on highlighting any issues which would give rise to legal difficulties for NAMA in managing the loans or in engaging in enforcement actions in respect to them.  As part of this acquisition process, the participating institutions provide the certificate and warranty to NAMA that, save as disclosed in the legal due diligence reports, the loan and security documentation are legal, valid and binding against the obligor, represents the entire agreement between the institution and the obligor and is fully enforceable against them.<\/p><p> Since the acquisition of loans commenced in 2010, NAMA has reviewed legal documentation of its acquired loans for the purposes of restructuring, sales, enforcement and providing new finance.<\/p><p>Each participating institution had different operating practices concerning its legal documentation which included the use of standard form facilities and security documents and general terms and conditions, the use of bespoke loan security documents drafted by their external lawyers and a combination of both standard and bespoke documents.  Recurring issues which NAMA encountered with legal documentation included items of security not actually taken, guarantees not confirmed on the granting of a new facility and development loans with no security over work in progress or step-in rights.  Other issues included defective Land Registry dealings and in a few cases missing original documents, such as title.  Where a documentation issue was identified following acquisition, it was generally capable of remediation and remediation was carried out by NAMA.  Where remediation was not possible, NAMA sought to revisit the acquisition<b><\/b>value<b><\/b>of the loan in question and to claw back any amounts that may have been overpaid.<br\/><br\/>As regards the governance model in place in respect of loan and asset acquisition, NAMA dedicates substantial resources towards ensuring that the loan valuation and acquisition process was managed to highest professional standards.  This was important not least to ensure that the process and the valuations which emerged received the approval of the European Commission.  I have provided an outline earlier in the statement of the comprehensive rigorous approach that we adopted, particularly as regards the valuation of property collateral and the due legal diligence, both of which were key towards safeguarding the integrity of the whole process. <br\/><br\/>As regards the governance model in place in respect of post-acquisition loan management, the C&amp;amp;AG's second special report in NAMA -  NAMA Management Loans since 2012 - provides a detailed account of the approach that we adopted to management loans and debtor relationships.  NAMA decided that it would engage directly with its largest debtor connections, initially 189 NAMA-managed debtor connections with debt of &euro;61 billion, that it would delegate the day-to-day relationship management of another 583 debtor connections with &euro;13 billion in par debt within tight and specific delegated authority limits to the participant institutions, known as PI managed connections.  We put in place a process to oversee the institutions and the performance of credit and operation of functions on our behalf.<br\/><br\/>As part of our initial engagement with debtors, we asked them to prepare business plans which set out how they propose to repay their liabilities.Following review of each connection's draft business plan, we adopted strategies which involved one or other of the following - debtor support, earlier asset disposal or enforcement.  In return for support from NAMA, including funding of commercially-viable development projects, debtors were expected to agree a number of conditions, including asset sales disposals, reversing asset transfers to third parties, ceding unencumbered assets to NAMA as additional security, giving NAMA control over rental income from investments assets and agreeing to cuts in overhead costs.  NAMA retained control of credit decisions to a cascading system of credit limits and delegated authority ranging from the NAMA board down successively to the credit committee to NAMA senior management and to NAMA units in the participating institutions.<br\/><br\/>As regard the loans acquired by NAMA from the participating institutions, banks would not have been required to measure them at fair value while they were still on their books.  An asset valuation would only be carried out on a loan portfolio if it was mooted for sale or transfer.  The participating institutions would have measured their loan books in accordance with the International Financial Reports and Standards, IFRS, specifically IAS 39.  This accounting mechanism requires loans originally arranged in advance of them to be measured on an amortised cost basis.  This was done on an assumption that the loans remain on the financial institutions books until maturity.  At least once a year, banks would have had to perform an impairment exercise in respect ... in accordance with contra rules of IAS 39.  This requires the banks to recognise an impairment provision against the book value loans where there is a reduction in the amount likely to be received or a change in the timing of future loan cash flows, commonly referred to as objective evidence of impairment.IAS 39 uses an incurred loss basis as opposed to an expected loss basis.Under IAS 39, banks cannot provide for expected future credit losses.  As the impairment methodology operates on an incurred loss model, there can often be a time delay until those losses are identified, known as &quot;the emergence period&quot;.  During the duration of such emergence periods, it may be some time before the losses and loan portfolio are actually identified and have to be recognised as losses by the financial institutions.  Following the banking crisis in 2008 and 2009, it was widely accepted among accounting practitioners that IAS 39 impairment methodology did not appropriately reflect potential losses in a loan portfolio or did not do so on a timely basis.  As a result, the International Accounting Standards Board has redrafted IAS 39 and the new standard IFRS 9, which will be implemented later in this decade, changed impairment methodology to allow for future expected credit losses to be reported on a more timely basis.  In summary there were significant differences between the valuation methodology used by NAMA and that used by the banks give the latter did not have to apply fair value methods to their loan portfolios.<\/p><p>Because they originated loans, they could deal with them on a non-amortised basis.  NAMA by contrast did not originate the loans and had to value them at acquisition at fair value basis in accordance with IAS 39 rules, i.e., recognising on NAMA's balance sheet on day one that &euro;31.8 billion was the fair value of the loans, not &euro;74 billion.<\/p><p> I should point out that the valuation methodology used by the Irish financial institutions was no different to that used internationally and that they were in no way departing from conventional accounting standards in the approach they adopted.  If anything the accounting standard lagged the market reality whenever IFRS was used.  One of the misguided comments directed at NAMA in the early days was that it crystallised a massive loss in the banking system through an overly stringent valuation approach.  It acquired loan balances of &euro;74 billion for &euro;31.8 billion, equivalent to a discount of 57%.  By contrast, it was argued the banks, left to their own devices, would eventually have recovered much of the &euro;74 billion par debt.  I strongly disagree with this contention and would suggest that much of the &euro;74 billion was never going to be seen again.<\/p><p> The NAMA acquisition process forced institutions to recognise their losses earlier than their own IAS 39 accounting valuation methodology would have required of them.  In the absence of NAMA, you would have probably seen a phased unveiling of losses over a three, four, five, or perhaps even more years, with a consequent drip-drip effect in terms of the needs for capital replenishment and the corrosive impact of the creditworthiness of the sovereign.  The NAMA process enabled the Irish banking system to recognise and address upfront the loan loss difficulties that it had created for itself long before NAMA was ever conceived.  The fact that the asset management company model is now being copied in other countries suggests that, belatedly, it is recognised that the impaired banking systems do not tend to rectify themselves.  An external body is needed to bring a fresh independent approach to resolution.<\/p><p> I do not have direct knowledge of the extent of commercial due diligence conducted by borrowers or, indeed, conducted by the institutions at the time the loans were advanced.  However, based on our own experience of the loans which we acquired and which we have since sought to manage, I am in a position to make some observations on the lending environment which prevailed prior to 2007.  In that context I would like to draw the committee's attention to table 1 below which in my view provides an eloquent summary into the insight of some of the issues which are the subject of your inquiry.  The table presents a distribution of NAMA's acquired portfolio by size of the debtor connection aggregate of loans acquired from five participating institutions.<\/p><p> In summary, we acquired the loans of 772 debtor connections who borrowed &euro;74 billion from the institutions.  This excludes any additional amounts borrowed by these same debtors from institutions not covered by NAMA.  I do not know how much additional borrowing from non-NAMA banks was involved, but I conservatively estimate it to be at least &euro;10 billion.  There are 12 debtor connections with debt in excess of &euro;1 billion each, aggregating to a par debt of &euro;22.2 billion, an average of &euro;1.85 billion per connection.  Another 133 debtor connections have debt between &euro;100 million and &euro;999 million, aggregating to &euro;35.7 billion par debt, an average of &euro;269 million per connection.  And finally, there are 627 so-called smaller debtor connections with a debt of less than &euro;100 million, aggregated to &euro;16 billion debt, an average of &euro;26 million per connection.  As mentioned the table does not include lending advanced by institutions such as Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland and a number of institutions which were aside of the NAMA process.  It does not include loans advanced by AIB and Bank of Ireland to borrowers whose aggregate borrowing was less than &euro;20 million and it also excludes property loans which remained with the participating institutions on the basis that they were not eligible for transfer to us.<\/p><p> NAMA observations and concentration risk: You will note from table 1 above that some &euro;34 billion par debt has been advanced to the largest 29 debtor connections.  Lending on this scale to a relatively few debtors suggests that the banks consider property lending to be almost a one-way bet, not withstanding the well-established cyclical behaviour of property markets and the steep rise in prices from 2002 onwards.  It is clear that financial institutions and debtors shared a groupthink view that prices would remain on an upward trajectory and that there was limited downside associated with property lending.  The view was presumably supported by favourable medium-term economic and demographic projections produced by economists and commentators and by the expectations that any setback in the property market would be temporary and minor, in line with an expected soft landing of the Irish economy.  There was an obvious mismatch that few economists or commentators called into question when, on the one hand, lending was growing at over 30% on average per annum in institutions, and, on the other, the economy was growing at rates at between 6% and 9% over the period 2003 to 2007.<\/p><p>The impact of greater competition amongst lenders was to increase risky and imprudent lending.  In particular, lending on the basis of it providing very high levels of project funding, sometimes at 100%, appears to have been quite common.  The equity pledged by the debtor, when required, often took the form of unrealised paper equity from other transactions.  Few, if any, financial institutions wanted to be left out of what was seen as a profitable business due to the larger lender margins and the relatively low operating costs.  In normal market conditions, a finite number of viable development projects would be able to secure finance from a finite pool of the bank funding available for property development.  In perverse conditions, which held sway in the Irish market up to 2007, there was far too much bank funding available and, ultimately, it found its way not only to a finite number of development projects which were viable, but also to many other projects which could be viable only on very heroic and often mistaken assumptions.  The sheer weight of debt funding that was available caused an overflow effect into riskier projects which could not have been entertained in normal market conditions.<\/p><p> It was difficult to avoid the impression that the institutions perceived lending as a sales activity and that, in the rush to expand bank balance sheets, a rigorous focus on lending quality was lost.  Some bank balance sheets doubled between 2003 and 2008.  In one case, the size of the bank balance sheet quadrupled.  Based on our experience of managing acquired loans, it is difficult to fathom a robust rationale for a significant portion of the property lending and, at the very least, it raises the question of whether lenders' remuneration was based on lending volume rather than on the quality of such lending.  It is unclear to what extent there was analysis by bank strategists, by the Financial Regulator or by economists of the relationship between the volume of lending, by region or by sector, and the projected demand for property assets, by region and by sector.  Nor is it clear to what extent did the institutions subject their lending to vigorous stress testing or, indeed, were required to do so by the Financial Regulator.<\/p><p> Net worth: In advancing additional funding during the years up to 2007, the lending institutions appear to have relied heavily on assessments of debtors' perceived net worth &ndash; the difference between a debtor's valuation of his assets and liabilities.  Statements of affairs &ndash; a list of assets, liabilities and value &ndash; were relied upon to provide comfort that a debtor's financial position could support new lending and that he could service his liabilities.  However, these documents were not always audited and were often self-certified with asset values assessed by the debtors themselves.<\/p><p> Compounding the weakness was the fact that, for most debtors, assets comprised mainly or exclusively property assets so that when the market collapsed, the value of the asset side of balance sheets plummeted and the net worth evaporated rapidly.  As market prices rose in the years up to 2007, so the self-assessed net worth of debtors also appeared to rise, thereby giving rise to ... giving the lending institutions a sense of false comfort over additional security that did not exist.<\/p><p> Land and development assets: This issue was particularly acute in cases where a debtor's property portfolio had significant exposure to land and development assets.  A fall ... A rise or fall in market prices has a multiplier effect on the value ... on the price of land indeed for residential or commercial development.  The price of development land is a residual value after costs and developer's profit margin are deducted from projected sales proceeds.  If projected sales proceeds based on market prices fall significantly, there may be little or no residual value.  The land goes back to agricultural value or less.  This is illustrated in table 2 below.  This would explain the steep fall, in some cases of up to 90%, in the value of development land in the years after 2007.  Much of the land had been bought speculatively.  That is also why NAMA acquired some loans for only 10% or less of their face value.  The fact that a substantial proportion of lending was secured by riskier land and development assets also explains why bank balance sheets suffered such extensive damage to their solvency.  Unlike investment assets, there was no income flow associated with land and development assets and, in the absence of demand and liquidity, there was nothing to arrest the fall in prices as it gathered downward momentum.<\/p><p> Liquidity in the land market dried up completely.  There were no buyers because residential prices had fallen to such a level that the construction of new houses was unprofitable.  This point should be borne in mind whenever you hear the contention that NAMA or, indeed, any other market participant should have been funding the construction of houses in 2010 and 2011.  It simply would have not made commercial sense by reference to market prices then prevailing and neither debt or equity providers would have made a compelling case for funding speculative development at that stage.<\/p><p> Smaller debtor connections: While the concentration of lending among the larger debtor connections was clearly excessive, our experience has been that the quality of such lending tended to be better quality than the lending to some of the smaller debtor connections.  As set out in table 1 above, a total of &euro;16 billion was advanced to 627 borrowers who had aggregate debts of less than &euro;100 million each.  Generally speaking, the initial discounts on these smaller debtor connection loans were higher and NAMA has to take even higher impairment provisions on them in the interim.<\/p><p>While some of the lending was to professional, well-managed entities, much of it was to individuals or syndicates whose primary business was not property developments, or who became involved in property developments relatively late in the cycle.  Much of the lending related to potential development projects in or near towns, or in rural areas, rather than main urban centres.  In some cases, one can see how an individual project may have made commercial sense to a bank, if assessed in isolation.  The problem was that similar projects were receiving funding from other financial institutions and clearly not all those projects could have ever been simultaneously viable.  <\/p><p> Corporate infrastructure: some of the debtor connections who received this funding did not have adequate support in corporate infrastructure.  In particular, some of the property businesses which built up ... quickly built up balance sheets of &euro;1 billion or more, did not have the financial expertise required to manage bank balance sheets of that size and it does not appear that the institutions made much of an effort to push for improved governance of the debtor's businesses.  By contrast with our situation, property lending in the UK is largely advanced to publically quoted companies, which are suitably resourced to manage their bank balance sheets and the risks; for instance, British Land, a listed UK development company, which has debt levels comparable to some of NAMA's larger debtors, have more than 200 employees.  As the crisis emerged in 2008, 2009, UK property plcs accessed the equity market and used that funding to pay down debt. That option was not available here, given the majority of debtors were, in effect, sole traders and they were totally reliant on bank debt.  A debtor's track record and reputation appear to be paramount consideration for the lenders.  There appeared to be a highly accommodating attitude among financial institutions towards the more prominent debtors and a concern that, if that institution was not particularly amenable, the debtor would look elsewhere for the funding of future projects.  Clearly debtors were not slow to exploit the unusual lending market.  Some of the more professional debtor connections tended to focus on particular sectors in which they had developed a particular expertise.  This is particularly the case for debtor connections whose main asset base was outside of Ireland.  However, one of the more notable features of the acquired loan portfolio by NAMA was that many debtor connections had borrowed against a diverse range of assets.  It was not unusual to find, when all the loan information was collated, that a connection had exposure to a number of jurisdictions and to a number of sectors, including office, retail, residential, in addition to ownership of one or more hotels, as well as undeveloped land.  After NAMA acquired the loans, it was not always apparent to us what the debtor's strategy might have been in assembling such a range of assets which was so diverse, by reference to a sector and location.  The obvious conclusion, in some cases, was that the compulsion to purchase more and more uncorrelated assets was entirely related to the almost unlimited availability of debt funding.  Many of these asset sectors require specialist business skills which do not appear to have been available to some of the debtor connections involved.  The fact that many of them had only small supporting teams means they could have found it difficult to devote the requisite skill sets to the range and scale of projects covered by their borrowings.  A debtor who was a successful house builder will not necessarily have the expertise to manage a group of hotels, or run a shopping centre, but this does not appear to have inhibited the lenders involved.<\/p><p> I hope that these comments are helpful in terms of assisting the committee to obtain a fuller understanding of some of the issues which you have been asked to address.

I need to say at the start that we're here, of course representing an agency that was a key part of the response to the banking crisis, rather than as a contributor to that crisis.  You've asked me to deal with five lines of inquiry, and I will take them each in turn.  The first one was the commercial real estate development model that existed before the crisis and that model was ultimately, of course, very costly for this State in terms of fixing the financial institutions that funded it and, as a consequence, an inordinate and painful burden has been placed on citizens as the necessary steps are taken to restore normality to our economy.  Volumes have been, and I'm sure will be, written about the confluence of factors that made that model inherently high risk, vulnerable and unsustainable.  Contributing factors, such as zoning and planning policy, tax incentives, irresponsible developer funding, consumer mortgage lending, absence of market analysis and others, have been well documented and no doubt will be explained to you by experts in these areas.  The most effective way that I can contribute is to give you comment, informed largely by NAMA's experience over the past five years in dealing with the consequences of the banking crisis and our role in fixing it.  As NAMA was established to acquire the loans of the largest real estate developers, I will focus on the structure of lending to these developers.<\/p><p>NAMA, having bought these loans, is now for such developers the successor to the banks.<\/p><p> Let me talk first about debt funding dependence.  From that vantage point what jumps out most of all is a commercial real estate model with an almost complete dependence on debt funding.  This had the effect of placing all of the risk with the banks, and as it transpired, ultimately with the State and its citizens.  By way of background, traditionally in lending equity is provided by the borrower to mitigate a bank's risk.  Equity, in effect, puts the borrower, not the bank, in the riskiest capital position.  In the event of default the borrower is the first to lose.  New rules in mortgage lending, for example, require that a person buying a home now has to come up with a 20% deposit as equity.  However, based on NAMA's experience that fundamental precondition of bank funding was rarely observed in the pre-crash commercial real estate model.<\/p><p> While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were typically less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality in many cases was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling up of unrealised paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position.  Rarely, if ever, was it in the form of cash.  On the face of it then, developers had some skin in the game, but in reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions, levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.  This meant that the banks were taking high equity grade risk for low debt grade returns, and in fact even those low debt returns were often not realised, but rather accrued as rolled-up interest booked as income in bank financial statements.  These were, and continue to be, the accounting rules under IFRS, not just in Ireland but wherever IFRS is adopted.<\/p><p> In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It's safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses, and that's what happened.  Those losses, as we now know to our cost, have had to be funded by Irish citizens to the tune of &euro;64 billion.  It would be no thanks to many of those who were the cause of this if, ultimately, that cost turns out to be less than the &euro;64 billion.<\/p><p> There was a relaxed approach to project feasibility.  The recycling of unrealised equity positions from project to project meant that the model could only keep working as long as prices kept rising and the banks kept lending, and few questioned those assumptions.  Many decisions seemed to be based on a view, shared by bankers and developers, that property prices could continue to defy the fundamental law of any market that when prices rise unsustainably, there is always going to be a day of reckoning, and the steeper the price, the more painful the reckoning.<\/p><p> This was compounded by the fact that the model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.  It's much easier to take an optimistic view of a project when you are not being asked to put your own hard-earned capital at risk.  Based on the loans that NAMA took over, feasibility analyses in respect of projects either didn&rsquo;t exist or were incomplete or were based on flawed, overly optimistic, assumptions about the future.  In the residential development sector, for instance, feasibility workings seem to have been based on aspirational exit sales values in an already frenzied peak market.  Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets.  The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned and that the long-established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant to Ireland.  In this model the banks were taking the type of risk normally the preserve of private equity or hedge fund providers without demanding the same level of rigorous analysis that those providers would have made a condition of funding in the first place.<\/p><p> Mr. McDonagh has talked in some detail about another facet of the model: the dearth of professionally-run developer platforms.  The banks were quite clearly lending to individuals and companies that, notwithstanding the massive sums involved, had little or no supporting corporate infrastructure, had poor governance and had inadequate financial controls and this applied to companies of all sizes.  The banks failed to ensure that Irish property companies, to whom they advanced billions of euros in lending, operated to the same corporate governance standards as their peers in other jurisdictions or, indeed, similar-sized entities in other sectors of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>There was over-production of residential accommodation in the economy and this, and a range of other factors at play, cumulatively resulted in the situation where development and construction output totally overshot what would have been considered the normal level of production in an economy of our size.  This is best illustrated by the construction of 90,000 new houses and apartments in Ireland in 2006 - 90,000 new houses in one year for a population that was then 4.2 million.  The output was more than five times the European average at the time.  In the same year in Britain, to meet demand from a population which was 14 times the size of Ireland's, just 190,000 new residential properties were built.  The Irish development model, fuelled by a combination of the poor lending practices that I have just described, a scattergun approach to tax incentives, poor zoning and planning decisions and a complete absence of rigorous, independent analysis of population and market trends, appears to have been relying blindly on the belief that if you build it, they will come, and no matter what price, they will buy.  I should say, lest I give the wrong impression, that this problem was not peculiar to the residential sector.  All segments of the market were affected by varying degrees of over-supply.  You could be forgiven, indeed, for describing the sentiment that informed this over-supply as hubris, and perhaps in some of the more spectacular lendings as trophy-chasing.  Part of the Irish landscape still bears the scars of that approach in the form of unfinished and half-finished housing estates, some of which have been inherited by NAMA and which NAMA is now funding to completion.  <\/p><p> And the final point I would like to mention relates to the quality of construction, and, in some cases, the absence of much quality at all.  NAMA has incurred multi-million euro costs in remediating building defects such as non-compliance with regulatory standards, including fire safety standards, as we prepare assets for sale or for occupation.  Many of these defects stem from a lack of oversight and attention to detail from both the builder, developer and the building control divisions of the local authorities.  This was compounded by the sheer volume of development which reduced the due diligence carried out.  Hopefully, these issues have been fully addressed with the recently enacted Building Control (Amendment) Regulations Act of 2014.  Chairman, that gives you a picture of what the model was like before the crash based, again I emphasise, on NAMA's experience of the aftermath.  <\/p><p> So, what would a sustainable model look like? To finish off this segment could I suggest learning from NAMA's experience that a sustainable model for the future would, at a minimum, include all of the following features: In the funding area there would be a sustainable financing model that includes both debt and equity finance.  There would be proper banking supervision, robust but not stifling.  There would be macro prudential measures to flatten peaks and troughs.  There would be adequate bonding for customers and there would be pertinent audit standards such indeed as IFRS 9 which is coming down the tracks and they would be implemented rigorously.  In the development sector there would be properly resourced and governed development and construction companies, including publicly quoted companies.  There would be active and skilled boards of directors with proper oversight.  There would be prudent management of balance sheet exposures, especially debt arrangements, and there would be adequate building regulations and appropriate oversight in relation to building standards.  <\/p><p> And then in the planning and market area in general there would be a holistic, centralised approach to zoning, planning and infrastructure provision.  There would be long-term social housing planning and there would be publicly-available information of population projections, demand projections and the likely supply outlook.  In regard to the latter, NAMA has, with the Irish bank and payments federation, taken an initiative to fund research by the ESRI into the residential housing market, specifically into the likely pattern of emerging demand and the potential supply constraints that may influence future market activity.  That research, and similar research from other sources, will be important in terms of guiding future development investment plans in Ireland.  What the initial findings, by the way, of that ESRI research tell us is that the vast majority of future housing demand will be in Dublin, the surrounding commuter belt and other major urban centres.  Sadly, it is also clear from the research that some of the housing supply built at the height of the boom will never be occupied because it is located in areas where there is no demand.<\/p><p>The second and third lines of inquiry which you asked me to deal with, Chairman, are the duty to ... NAMA's duty to obtain the best financial return and its contribution to property market activity, and if you agree, I will take both of those together.  <br\/><br\/>NAMA's mandate derives from the NAMA Act and section 10 of that Act defines the purposes of NAMA.  It requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State, to deal expeditiously with the assets acquired by it and to protect or otherwise enhance the value of those assets.  That is the core of NAMA's mandate and it is clearly a commercial one.  Our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>, therefore, is to get the best financial return from the assets in our portfolio and, crucially, to do so expeditiously.  It is not an option for us to adopt what might be termed a &quot;long-term holding strategy&quot; to await some optimum price level at some indeterminate point in the future before disposing of the assets.  We have to do our business expeditiously, which means responding pragmatically to market conditions by taking advantages of opportunities to sell assets where demand and price are favourable.  It's also the case, though, that the phrase, &quot;achieving the best financial return for the State&quot;, has implications beyond simply getting the highest price for an asset, which, of course, we always seek to do.  <br\/><br\/>NAMA paid for the loans it acquired from the banks with senior debt of &euro;30.2 billion guaranteed by the State.  Central to the best financial return for the State is repaying that senior debt and repaying it quickly.  It is a contingent burden that should be removed from citizens as soon as practicable, not just because of the amount, not just because of the interest payable, not just because of the impact on the banks' balance sheets but because of the wider implications for the sovereign. <br\/><br\/>It became very clear very quickly from early engagement with the troika that they would have had serious concerns if NAMA had signalled or adopted any type of extended senior debt redemption schedule.  They regarded repayment of the NAMA debt as one of the key recovery factors for this country and one of the key deliverables in exiting the bailout.  I would contend that if NAMA had not reduced its debt as expeditiously as it has, Ireland could have been in a second bailout, as market concerns about the contingent liability would have been very real.  The troika closely monitored the progress that we were making in meeting our first major senior debt redemption target - that was &euro;7.5 billion by the end of 2013.  To the troika, but also to the capital markets and the rating agencies, the signal effect of reducing the State's contingent liability was very important.  It was recognised that in so far as NAMA could make significant progress on redeeming its senior debt, there would be collateral benefits in terms of the creditworthiness of the sovereign and, by extension, in terms of Ireland's borrowing costs.  This has been recognised in Ireland's ratings upgrades and it is an obvious contributory factor to the very favourable position of Ireland right now in the bond and money markets and, indeed, it has been recognised as such.<br\/><br\/>I might also mention that, for the second year in succession, we have been in a position to pay a coupon on our subordinated debt.  This has had a positive impact on the balance sheets of AIB and Bank of Ireland, manifested in the significant upward revision in the valuation of their holdings of our subordinated debt on their balance sheets.  It is a simple fact that debt redemption needs cash generation and cash generation needs asset sales.  <br\/><br\/>We have been able to repay our senior debt well ahead of schedule because of our strong cash performance - nearly &euro;20 billion to date through asset and loan sales and &euro;5 billion in non-disposal, mainly rental, income, &euro;25 billion in total.  Thoughtful, well aligned asset sales in the Irish and UK markets in particular have been key to this very strong cash generation. <br\/><br\/>NAMA actively instigated a programme of asset sales by its debtors in Britain in the period 2010 to 2012 when conditions were strong in that market and, likewise, we responded actively when conditions in the Irish market improved significantly in 2013 and 2014.  That approach accords fully with two key principles underpinning NAMA's strategy: no fire sales and no hoarding.  In each of our main markets our approach has been to release assets for sale in a phased and orderly manner that's consistent with the level of demand, the availability of credit, and the absorption capacity of the market.As a result, London and the UK accounted for almost 80% of all disposals between 2010 and 2012.<\/p><p>Ireland in contrast accounted for just 12% of disposals during that period and that approach enabled NAMA not only to achieve the best possible return during its early deleveraging phase, but it also allowed the Irish market time to reach its trough and to begin its recovery.  A fire sale in the Irish market at that time would have been ... would have had the effect of intensifying and prolonging the market's downturn, and would have been contrary to both NAMA's overriding commercial objective of achieving the best possible return for the State and its ancillary objective of contributing to a sustainable level of activity in the Irish property market. It could also have crystalised a loss on the NAMA portfolio, which because of the State guarantee would have created additional losses for taxpayers on top of the losses that they have already had to fund in recapitalising the various financial institutions.<\/p><p> We were not, however Chairman, during that time sitting on our hands...on our hands in Ireland in that 2010 to 2012 period. During that time NAMA placed a major emphasis on asset management to enhance the future value...disposal value of the collateral securing its loans, most notably by working with debtors and receivers to complete unfinished projects, to fund new viable commercial and residential development and to enhance planning permissions and remove other obstacles to development.  During that period when there was little other activity in the Irish market we invested over &euro;600 million in the sector and during that crucial period we also placed a major emphasis on stimulating the market's recovery and fostering the sense that the market was open for business despite perceptions to the contrary.  One initiative was a vendor finance fund of two billion, and there is detail in the statement of how that was deployed, Chairman, but in the interest of brevity I won't read out the details.  But that vendor finance fund played an important part in generating activity in the early days of recovery when the banks had stopped lending for commercial property and investors were still wary of committing funds to Ireland.  These early transactions signalled to international and domestic investors that the Irish market was open for business and played a vital role in attracting finance and activity, particularly from overseas investors where previously there was little or none.<\/p><p> There is now an active Irish market and NAMA is now taking advantage of that.  The major improvements in the market over the past 18 months have enabled us to shift our disposal focus more to the Irish market.  Reflecting this, in 2014 disposals in Ireland accounted for 46% of all disposals, while London and the rest of the UK accounted for 33%.  In addition to the opportunity to accelerate disposals through existing channels, we have also been taking advantage of new opportunities as they emerge, such as packaging assets for sale to satisfy demand, providing regular flows to the market or providing greater clarity to potential investors, allowing those with limited capacity to bid on a greater number of transactions, thus widening the number of potential bidders and increasing the potential return to the State.<\/p><p> In the light of the positive shift in the Irish property market and its outlook, the board of NAMA undertook a review of strategy in early 2014, and following that review we moved to take further advantage of strong investor appetite and to accelerate disposals with a view to redeeming 80% of senior debt by the end of 2016, a full two years ahead of the original schedule, and completing the deleveraging process in 2017-18. <\/p><p> In the context of the clear supply shortages evident in the Dublin residential and office markets, NAMA is also facilitating and funding the delivery of 4,500 new homes in Dublin and the greater Dublin area, and is also facilitating the provision of 3.84 million square feet of prime office space in the Dublin docklands SDZ, to ensure adequate office supply to meet growing demand. <\/p><p> In summary Chairman, as the committee has specifically asked the question, I would say that NAMA has played an important part in stimulating activity in the market. Our interventions were at all times strategic, helping to lift the market off the floor and to stimulate activity levels that are more sustainable in the long run.  For quite a while, indeed, we were almost alone in doing this. <\/p><p> The fourth line of inquiry, Chairman, you asked me to deal with is the contribution to the social and economic development of the State.  In the context of the overriding commercial mandate that we have just discussed, we seek to manage our portfolio in Ireland in a manner that complements the objectives of other public bodies, including Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  One way that NAMA gives practical effect to this is by giving public bodies first option on the purchase at current assessed market valuations of property securing NAMA loans.  In line with that commitment we have facilitated the sale of land and property for a range of public uses including schools and health care facilities.  An aspect of that work that is very important to NAMA is the delivery of houses and apartments for social purposes...social housing.  Where we can make properties available for social housing in a way that is consistent with section 10, it is a win-win for everybody involved.  And we have identified more than 6,000 properties as being available and potentially suitable for local housing.  Local authorities have confirmed demand for about 2,000 of theses, and while I am a little disappointed that take-up hasn't been higher, I do understand that local authorities and the Housing Agency are obliged to comply with their own policies on the location of social housing. But we are working hard to deliver on the properties for which demand has been confirmed, and at the end of 2014 more than 1,000 had been delivered and today that figure is very near 1,200, and by the end of the year we would hope to achieve the delivery of all of the remaining properties up to the 2,000 for which the local authorities have indicated demand.  It is important to say, by the way, that it is not just a question of handing over the keys to the local authorities.  In most cases significant investment is required to complete the property and to carry out estate-wide works.  In this way, indeed, the beneficiaries of NAMA's social housing extend beyond the residents of the new properties.  For existing residents, empty houses become inhabited and outstanding works are completed and capital expenditure in excess of &euro;20 million, has been incurred to date in carrying out such work. <\/p><p> We also, Chairman, facilitate commercial transactions and that is another important part of work...of NAMA's work in the Irish property market that might not otherwise take place.  A good example of this is NAMA's ongoing work in identifying suitable properties for companies looking to establish or expand existing business operations in Ireland and facilitating engagement between those companies and NAMA debtors and receivers.  NAMA's work in this area is very closely aligned with that of IDA Ireland and other State agencies, whose core responsibility is to attract and expand foreign direct investment activity and employment in Ireland and there are similar examples of that, Chairman, in the written statement but I won't read them out. <\/p><p> NAMA makes a wider contribution also in its rent abatement initiative to help retailers that are struggling to meet their contracted rent obligations.  The aggregate annual value of abatements agreed to date is in excess of &euro;23 million. In addition to this, NAMA has agreed long-term rent reductions worth over &euro;40 million.  This does mean that NAMA has agreed to forego rent due to it, but the corollary is that we are safeguarding jobs and activity and businesses in the wider economy. <\/p><p> We also work hard, including through our interaction with public representatives such as yourselves, to facilitate the letting and saleing of land to local community and sporting organizations and to accommodate other local requests where we can.  And often these may not be particularly high-profile initiatives but they are important locally. And a very recent illustration is our capacity to accommodate a request from the Blarney Community Association for the provision of temporary car parking facilities for the community's St. Patrick's Day festival. I just give it as an example of things we do like that.  It is totally coincidental, Chairman, that it is in Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>My constituency Mr. Chairperson, so you are okay, fire away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#N00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429657200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The overall point I would make, is that while NAMA is guided by its commercial objective, it doesn't operate in a vacuum.  We are conscious of the impact of our work on the wider Irish economy and on communities and we work hard to ensure that our impact is a positive one.<\/p> <p>  The final line of inquiry you asked me to deal with Chairman, was the establishment of performance metrics by the board of NAMA.  The key measure of NAMA is our capacity to repay our &euro;31.8 billion debt.  Progress we are making can be seen by the fact that we have already exceeded the cumulate ... excuse me, 50% senior debt redemption target originally set for the end of 2016. We have done that two years ahead of schedule. <\/p> <p>  Last month we redeemed another billion of our senior bonds, bringing to &euro;17.6 billion the amount of senior debt that is redeemed to date.  That is 58% of the senior debt originally issued in 2010-2011.<\/p><p>We're able to repay our debt ahead of schedule because of the strong cash performance, the &euro;25 billion that I talked about earlier.  NAMA, while we're not a publicly limited company is an organisation that operates at the highest end of the public interest and governance spectrum.  The fact alone that NAMA must publish quarterly financial statements that are prepared in accordance with IFRS shows that NAMA also operates at the highest end of the transparency spectrum.  NAMA has adopted the best practices of corporate governance including financial and management reporting practices, board composition, and structure and risk management.  NAMA has designed and implemented a robust management information system, and has clearly defined key performance indicators in place, which form the bases of its internal reporting and monitoring framework whereby the NAMA board and sub-committees are regularly kept informed of the organisation's commercial and operational progress.  The board of NAMA also recently reviewed a C&amp;AG recommendation to the effect that it should set an expected or target rate of return to measure its overall performance, and that it should also measure its performance by reference to targets for the return on disposals, and on property held by debtors and insolvency practitioners.  In line with this, the board has approved a number of rate of return measures, which it considers appropriate for its business, and we propose to report on these additional measures in our 2014 annual report, which we expect to publish at the end of May.  <\/p><p>  In conclusion, Chairman, I would simply emphasise again the point I made at the outset that NAMA is here and is a key contributor to dealing with the fallout from the banking crisis and not a contributor to its cause.  I know you have asked NAMA to attend this committee in the context of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the domestic policy responses, and it is for others, including yourselves, to ultimately take a view on whether NAMA has indeed been such an appropriate and effective response.  However, I would say, in finishing up, that any assessment of this should take account of the following points: that NAMA has delivered in respect of each aspect of our mandate as laid down in the Act; we quickly and effectively acquire the eligible assets from the banks and the acquisition and evaluation of those assets has been cleared without qualification by the C&amp;AG and the EU Commission.  As the CEO has said this enabled the Irish banking system to recognise and address upfront the loan loss difficulties it had created for itself.  We have generated &euro;25 billion cash in the past five years; we have paid our own way; and we have generated profits of more than &euro;200 million in each of the last four years despite the constraints of a challenged property backed up for much of that period.<\/p><p> We have actively intervened in the property market in Ireland and contributed to the recovery now taking place.  That intervention was strategically timed to minimise further damage, stimulate the market at the right time and take advantage of growing investor interest.  I do believe we called it right.  We have advanced over &euro;1 billion into construction projects in Ireland in the past five years, and we plan and have the capacity to invest another &euro;3 billion if required.  And we have, to date, funded the construction of more than 1,900 new homes in Dublin.  In fact, NAMA funded the construction of 40% of all new homes delivered in Dublin in 2014, a statistic, I think, which is telling in itself.<\/p><p> We have made significant progress in facilitating the timely delivery of grade A office space, retail, leisure and residential accommodation in the Dublin docklands SDZ and wider central business district, and we have the capacity to invest &euro;3 billion in this and other capital projects all over Ireland.  We have facilitated the delivery of 1,200 properties for social housing, and we will have delivered 2,000 by the end of the year.  We are supporting 15,000 jobs and trading businesses directly re-linked to our loans.<\/p><p> However, most important, and I'll finish on this, we have made excellent progress on debt repayment.  We are already two years ahead of target in repaying our senior debt; we're committed to repaying 80% by the end of next year; we're committed to repaying 100% by 2017-18, and we are committed to full repayment of our subordinated date.  Finally, should conditions in the economy and in the property market continue to remain favourable, we are hopeful, based on our current projections, that NAMA may realise a surplus of up to &euro;1 billion for the taxpayer by the time we complete our work.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Daly.

So you can have what is called this time lag effect that while you expect maybe prices to fall in the future or the economy is going into downturn that hasn't actually happened at that point in time.  So you had this, I suppose, it's best illustrated by the following is that, you know, NAMA started acquiring the loans from institutions on 31 March 2010, but the first time the banks really recognised the scale of the losses they had was at the end of 2010 once NAMA had reported the loans, you know.  They weren't obliged to recognise those losses at 31 December 2009 because under IFRS effectively the NAMA event had not yet happened.  It was something that was going to happen after 31 December, and that is the fatal flaw in IAS 39.

And I think you know thinking back to the first tranche one transfers, which happened at the end of March 2010, myself and the chairman here did a press conference, I think there was complete shock in the country and also I suppose within the system probably leading up to that day in terms of the losses that were emerging, and obviously the losses got much higher as you went  down through the portfolio.  And I suppose it came to, I suppose a head really in September 2010 when the Government instructed NAMA to acquire the residual amount of the loans in bulk form and estimate the discount to what they would eventually be.

My overwhelming impression looking back on it is the ... I'm trying to find the right word but, what ... where was the business logic in a lot of this lending?  And it would be really I suppose, maybe, back to the that table we provided to the committee about the distribution of NAMA debtors.  The massive amount of lending to a very small number of people at the top, and then a lot of the what I would call  lending on hope value to people at the bottom.  A lot of that was related to land which wasn't even zoned, which had hope value more than anything else.  And then it was also I think I remember one of our surprises would have been that the banks seemed to have been acting sort of almost in isolation.  They didn't really have much interest in what a particular client's exposure was to another bank across the system.

There was one of the institutions admitted it was lending close to a 100% loan-to-value but that was an outlier.<\/p><p>So, on day 1, an institution might have lent somebody &euro;70 million for a &euro;100 million project.  That would be a 70% loan to value.  Typically, what happened as property prices begin to rise, the debtor went in and said:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Listen, I have seen another building I want to buy.  It's &euro;100 million.  Will you lend that to me?  The reason you can lend that to me is that the original building which you lent me on which was 70% loan to value, valued at &euro;100 million, is now worth &euro;120 million.<\/blockquote>The bank, it seems to me, then says, &quot;Okay yes we will give you the full &euro;100 million to buy the second building so, when you look at it, we have assets worth &euro;220 million and you only have &euro;170 million worth of borrowing so that's 77% loan to value.&quot;  So it still looks very prudent to anyone who comes in to look at the paper files to say the banks are still within their limits of lending.  Of course, the issue is that, when property prices start falling, that equity which was there from &euro;100 million to &euro;120 million disappears and also the new building that you bought which was effectively 100% lending at &euro;100 million has probably dropped in value as well, so your loan valuations shoot through the roof.  So, you can say that it looked to be clever lending, it looked to be good lending at the time but effectively the debtor was not putting up any additional equity for the second asset that he bought.  He was using the increase in value of the existing building to get the money for the next thing.  We've seen examples of that in the portfolio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#P01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>From the loan documentation that you had, new debts were being issued on the strength of other debts or unreleased equity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#Q00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429657200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Yes absolutely, we are in 2009.

The banks were seen to be very profitable, property lending was seen to be the clever thing to do, the economy was growing very strongly.  As I said in my opening statement, there was a fundamental disconnect between property lending of the banks' balance sheets that somebody in the regulator just did not pick up on and say, \"Bank lending has grown by, on average, over 30% per annum and the economy has grown between 6% and 9% per annum.\"  There was a complete disconnect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Yet banks would argue that the evidence is they would have employed chief risk officers, they would have had all sorts of regulations, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank.

Effectively, everybody thought there was going to be a soft landing.  Everybody thought it was a temporary slow down and that the economy would get up and running again and that it would not be as bad as it was.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be much worse than it was because I think it's key from the figures when anyone looks at them, they are publicly available if you take any of the reports from any of the banks from 2003 to 2008.  The two main banks' balance sheets were &euro;100 billion in 2003 each.  They were &euro;200 billion in 2008.  Anglo Irish Bank was &euro;25 billion in 2003, &euro;100 billion in 2008.

One was the way, the extent to which interest was being rolled up by the banks.  The extent in fact, to which, in some cases, new loans were being created to take account of the rolled up interest.  That, it seemed to me, was quite unusual.  Then, I suppose, the other aspect of it was - this may have come later but certainly we became aware of it fairly quickly, the extent to which banks were not really attempting to collect income that was coming to debtors.  Rental income in particular is a case in point.  One of the things we did in NAMA when we took across the loans and when we engaged with the debtors was to say, \"Well you have a loan on an asset, and that asset is earning a rental income.  Why do you think it should be going into your pocket now and not coming into NAMA\"?  We set about capturing all of that rental income.

So one of the first things we decided and really on day one, once we saw this, we will say, we want that income coming to NAMA so we want that income diverted to us and we have financial monitors on trading businesses to make sure that there is not unnecessary overheads being taken out.  So, one of the key successes of NAMA is when I talked to credit rate agencies as was the case on the day, is NAMA's collected &euro;25 billion to date in five years.  We have got &euro;20 billion collected from asset sales.  We have got &euro;5 billion collected from income on the assets.  That &euro;5 billion has been crucial.  If we did not collect that income and left it with the debtor, the debtor would have probably kept it and spent it or whatever in the case on the day.  We have collected that.  That is a huge sum in terms of the amount of cash flow for any businesses and our view is that that has to go to servicing your debt or amortising down your debt or whatever the case is and you know, we controlled ... we kept income in and we controlled the amount that we give back out to allow businesses and people to run their businesses which is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#Q01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Finally can I ask you, in relation to the 772 debtor connections who borrowed &euro;74 billion, and I am obviously quoting from your own, from the participating institutions, you estimate, I think conservatively, that these same debtors borrowed at least a further &euro;10 billion from non-participating institutions.

But it did mean that a debtor might have borrowed, say, &euro;500 million from the NAMA banks and he might have borrowed another &euro;250 million from a non-NAMA bank which was operating in the market but they were completely separate.  Usually in that situation, we ask the debtors when they submitted their business plans to tell us have you money borrowed from other banks and what is the arrangement for them.  Sometimes it is like a juggling act, that money was moving between assets which were funded by NAMA banks and assets which were funded by non-NAMA banks, by the debtor because he was trying to keep the balls in the air in terms of trying to keep everybody satisfied.   When we came in we said listen, this is our money, you have to deal with your other bank separately.

NAMA bought loans with a par value of &euro;74 billion, paid &euro;31.8 billion, so it resulted in losses of &euro;42 billion hitting the accounts of the participating financial institutions.  The obvious alternative could have been to leave the loans relating to the property and development sector on the books of the banks and work them out over time.  You seem to come to the view that the establishment of NAMA was the correct course of action.  You say it is recognised that impaired banking systems do not tend to rectify themselves so what's your basis for saying that and your basis for believing that the establishment of NAMA, and how things worked out subsequently, was a better outcome?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#T00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429657200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Well I suppose, even though I said it, I wasn't just basing it on my own view, Deputy.<\/p><p>I mean, we have met other countries who have had difficulties in their banking system.  They have come to talk to us about the model pursued by NAMA and, you know ... and the type of approach, and they have followed it.  It has been endorsed both by the IMF and the ECB as being the right thing to do.  And I suppose I would, you know, in a very, I suppose, local way look at the way, I suppose, you know, we took the assets - these problem assets - out of the banking system, brought them into NAMA and had to deal with them.  And it's a very expensive consequence for the taxpayer, who's had to recapitalise on the back of that, but I think when you look at the assets which remain within the banking system, the banking system has been quite slow to deal with their existing assets.  And, whereas, you know ... in terms of NAMA, like, we're five years in, we've collected &euro;25 billion in cash and we were originally designed to maybe ... that everybody expected we'd have a ten-year life, and now we're sort of saying we'll probably be finished in eight years.

And, I think the ... maybe if somebody wanted to do the sort of experiment of leaving these problem loans with the banks, really wasn't an option.  It wasn't an option from, I suppose, the troika in terms of this, that they decided they wanted these assets removed.<\/p> <p>  So, you know, other countries did different things.  Like, in the UK, they did an asset protection scheme where effectively they insured the assets of Royal Bank of Scotland, about &euro;280 billion.  And, you know ... but I suppose the big difference in terms of the UK and here was the UK probably had the firepower to be able to deal with that.  But also in terms of Ireland, once Ireland had done the bailout in September 2008, doing an asset protection scheme really wasn't an option.

I'm sure you have it already.<\/p> <p>  I think there's two other points, though, as to why breaking the links with the banks was important.  First of all, the other alternative .. well, you've three possibilities.  You've nationalisation, which we're not discussing; you have leaving them with the banks.  I think the big question mark there is ... the banks have been struggling since the crash.  They're still struggling.  They're getting better.  They're improving, but they're still struggling, for example, with mortgage arrears, so they're still struggling with other property loans that are on their books.  So, you can only imagine what state they would be in if they had another &euro;74 billion on top of that.<\/p> <p>  I think the other point is that ... and we've discussed relationship banking earlier.  Removing the loans out into NAMA, it broke the link decisively between the originator of the loan and the borrower.  And I think that has been hugely important.  I'm not saying we don't have a relationship with our debtors &ndash; of course we do &ndash; but it's a far different relationship to the type that some of the banks have had.<\/p> <p>  And I think, then, there is the actual practical stuff of just concentrating all of that &euro;74 billion in one agency with one focus.  We have ... we're not distracted by anything like mortgages or anything like that.  We have one focus, which is the &euro;74 billion, the repayment of the debt.  So, there's a concentration of skills and efficiencies and costs and scale and flexibility that you could actually bring to that.

You said the &quot;developer's equity contribution was a form of a rolling up of unrealised paper profit from other developments.&quot;  You said, &quot;In reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions, levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.&quot;  You said:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper. ... In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses [.  That is] what happened.<\/blockquote>You said, &quot;the model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.&quot;  And finally, Mr. Daly, you said:<blockquote>Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets.  The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned, and the long established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant.<\/blockquote>Now, Mr. Daly, when the Chair asked you, you weren't prepared to say, or you couldn't say, because you hadn't direct knowledge, that the relationship that was the subject of this, these actions, was as a result of a deferential relationship between a borrower and a lender.

There has been a number of cases where banks have sued solicitors where the form of security was defective.

I chair the Commission on Taxation, as the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, and we just identified three instances where tax incentives might be appropriate, that is, to correct market failure, to attract mobile investment and to offset shortcomings in other policy areas.

They seemed to centralise all decisions and that the conservative old-style bank management based in towns around the country which, you know, didn't lose much money was replaced by one which was meant to be better, obviously, but do you think moving discretion and moving local managers caused a gap between the manager and the people who were doing the borrowing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#HH00600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429657200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I think there's probably two elements to that, Senator.  There's no doubt that local managers would have been more in touch with what was going on in a particular locality.  And, in terms of what we talked earlier in relation to, I suppose, planning and zoning and hope value, local managers I think would probably have been more on top of that.  On the other hand, it may be that the amount of discretion allowed to local managers was not consistent, let's say, across the banks or even maybe within some banks.  The centralisation of lending certainly probably had the capability to bring a greater discipline to it, and you could expect, in fact, that that's where the greater ... the better analysis of overarching or macro market demand and supply might have been better located.<\/p> <p>  I suppose the one thing we would say is that, in terms of the documentation that came across to us in relation to the loans, is that I think part of the problem that the banks had in the end was the way in which, in many cases, the actual loan documentation and the detail about the origination of the loans was actually located in the local banks rather than necessarily all centralised in a particular ... one particular IT record or whatever.  And that in itself probably created some difficulties for the banks.  Again, that's in terms of what we saw in the documentation coming across.  So, if you have dispersed lending, if you don't have centralisation of records and if you don't have that sort of centralised oversight, then you do run the risk of not having a full picture of what your lending is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#HH00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>In the evidence this morning, the words \"regulator was not aware\" ... did we have the right system of regulation?

Anglo at the time, of course, had been, you know, had been nationalised, but you still have to deal with the loans.  So, do you let them in the nationalised bank for that bank to work them out?  Do you actually push them into the other banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB?

The whole rationale for NAMA was to take the land and development loans which the ECB did not want, put them into NAMA, NAMA issued Government-guaranteed bonds, the banks could bring these Government-guaranteed bonds to the ECB, and the ECB was happy to give them money on the back of this mechanism.

That's our ... that's what's in the Act.  We can't depart from that.  There is a secondary objective in the Act of a social and economic dividend and the way we try to reconcile it ... first of all, by saying that, and I have said this before, is that the best social and economic dividend, I think, that we can get out of all of this is that NAMA is successful then that our senior debt is repaid and if we have a surplus then that in itself is an economic and a social dividend because that billion can go wherever the Government decides to put it.  Side by side with that, it is everything from social housing that we spoke about earlier.  It is the funding of much needed, if I can put it, ordinary housing in Dublin, which we are doing.  We have committed to 4,500 of those by the end of 2016.  We are examining the potential in what would be our asset base to ... for another 20,000 to be delivered over the ensuing five years.  It is the whole docklands SDZ area which we really haven't referred to today, which is economic in the sense that it is going to provide much needed grade A office accommodation for FDI and other local industry.  It is social in the sense that in that mix there will be residential accommodation as well.  It is the ... and then all of the other stuff in relation to the sites that we have engaged with Department of Education in relation to schools, Department of Health and the HSE in relation to primary care centres and all of that.  And then all of the, I do not want to sound pejorative, but all of the local stuff where we have engaged sometimes with representatives like yourselves, where there is a local community group or sporting group or whatever and they are interested in a particular facility or piece of land or building and we do our utmost to actually engage on that.  So it is all of that is the social dividend.  I don't think it conflicts with our commercial objective.  Sometimes it's a balancing act to actually run the two together but I think we try to do our best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#DDD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1429657200,"counter":967,"content":"<p>And finally, both of you, and I think Mr. McDonagh on page four of your opening statement, you referred to, and he went off script I think even a little bit, to refer to the fact that there was no fire sale ... you mentioned Dr. Bacon specifically.

We don't have the luxury and we don't have the magic wand of knowing when is the absolute perfect time to sell a particular asset.  There are, of course, individual examples of where some assets were sold and they have been sold on for higher values but that has to be put into the context as well of people risking their capital in the market at the time when nobody was risking their capital in the market and they were coming in to make bids for the assets.  We made a very conscious decision that between 2010 and 2012, we held back on putting assets into the Irish market, despite everybody telling us we should be putting them onto market and accepting much lower prices.  We only sold &euro;1 billion worth of assets.  As of today, we have sold &euro;6 billion worth of assets and most of that ... &euro;4 billion of that mostly came from 2013 onwards as the market improved.

Of course I would in terms on behalf of the taxpayer but in terms of the information that we have at the time, we make the best decision we can, and we don't make it lightly, to sell the assets and of course there will be individual examples.  You can't dispose of 60,000 individual units where you are going to find that every single time you have hit the market at the optimal time but there are certainly many more examples which nobody talks about where we have made substantial profits and it was the right time to sell and nobody talks about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042200002#DDD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429657200,"counter":970,"content":"<p>And I think just a very quick point in relation, some of that criticism relates to one or two UK sales and yet last week or the week before, you have reports from Bloomberg and <i>The Irish Times<\/i>about the UK property market, particularly in London and particularly the high-end stuff which, where it was kind of opined that NAMA really should hang on for the next four or five, ten years and that is now under severe pressure.

We also believe that a proportion of that will be needed to develop the housing that I have talked about.  And those are two mandates that we have been given in recent times following the review of NAMA last year by the Minister for Finance.  So ... but, there is no Dublin-centric approach to this.  It is available elsewhere, but it has to be where there are NAMA assets located because we, you know, we're ... we can't ... we're not ... can't under the Act advance funding or get involved with non-NAMA debtors or assets or land or whatever that is not on our books.<\/p><p>The reality is that most of those assets, and I think Mr. McDonagh referred to them earlier, the remaining assets are in either the Dublin area or the Dublin conurbation, or in the other major centres, but I mean over the years, and I don't have the figures with me, but certainly they would have appeared in our annual report and I'm sure there'll be reference to them in our upcoming annual report, of areas where we have invested outside Dublin and indeed I didn't read it out in my statement, but if you look at page 12, where we talked about property transactions in Ireland that we have facilitated and that is certainly all of around Dublin, around Cork, around various places like that.  The housing, in relation to input to social housing, input to the remediation of ghost estates, is all over the country.

I'll be brief, it's been a long day for everybody.  I want to make three points.  The first is to emphasise again, as I did in my opening statement, that we are attending here as part of the solution.  We were not the cause of the crash.  We are essentially the ambulance, or whatever comes across, coming along afterwards to actually tidy it up.  And then, you know, we're here because you are considering the appropriateness and effectiveness of the domestic policy response and NAMA was an element of that.  I think there's two elements to that then: the appropriateness of it is one we have discussed, as to whether you go down the asset management agency route and we've had a general discussion about that.  I'm not going to repeat it, but it is generally now acknowledged worldwide that where you have a crash of such proportions and where you have such a concentration of lending by financial institutions into a sector like property, that banks don't fix themselves and you have to take it off their books.  I think we've generally discussed that.<\/p> <p>  There is some material, which I referred to earlier, by the ECB and wherever in relation to that theoretical, what is the correct approach, what is the appropriate approach, and to the extent that the inquiry may not have that, we would be happy to pass it on to you.  So, you consider the theory of the appropriateness of the approach and then you must move on to the effectiveness, did it work?  That was the theory, that was the approach; did it work in practice?  And that's where you get in, I think, to NAMA's performance over the past five years, and to the figures that we have provided to the inquiry today and maybe updated figures that we can provide to the inquiry by November, or whenever you're going to write your report.  We would say, and you won't be surprised, that NAMA has been a very effective response.  I've outlined in the last page of my statement why and I'm not going to repeat it.

As the Chairman said, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, established an expert group in July 2014.  We were asked to consider the long-term sustainable funding of higher education in this country and to identify funding options for the future.  I was asked to chair the group as an independent chair.  The other members are listed in the appendix to the opening statement that has been provided so I will not go through that information.  As the Chairman indicated, I am joined today by two members of the secretariat, Laura Casey and Mary Armstrong.  No doubt, they will be able to provide help if we get into detailed technical questions.<br\/><br\/>With the agreement of the Chairman, I will briefly outline the context for the group&rsquo;s establishment, the work programme we are undertaking and the process of consultation and engagement.  It is not only consultation with the universities and institutes of technology, IOTs, but also with parents, students, business and social organisations.  Today we will engage with the political process.  I will then outline the key messages coming through in our work to date and in the consultation paper we published.<br\/><br\/>The group was established to address the growing pressures on the higher education system, which are well documented.  Student numbers have grown substantially since 2008 and will continue to do so in the coming years, while staff numbers and public funding has reduced.  Of the 210,000 students in universities and institutes of technology, 25,000 have entered since the economic crisis began.  That is due to the increasing number of school leavers but also more adult learners entering the system.  There has been a reduction in staff of approximately 2,000, which is an approximate reduction of 10%.  As a result, the staff to student ratio has decreased and lags behind international norms.  Core expenditure per student has decreased by approximately 10%.  More important, in terms of demographics, enrolments are projected to grow by nearly one third over the next 15 years.  Those twin pressures are resulting in what the Higher Education Authority outlined to the committee in February, namely, &quot;a high and growing level of risk that significant unfunded expansion in numbers participating in higher education will damage the quality of provision&quot; of higher education in Ireland with all the attendant consequences.  I will return to the point.  The main message coming through to date in our work is that the <i>status quo<\/i>of increasing numbers without increasing resources or a better use of existing resources is not an option.<br\/><br\/>In looking at the future options, as a group we are very conscious that we are undertaking this work at a time when the country has come through a very deep crisis but is now at a turning point.  We are at the stage where we need to revive development in a way that lays the foundations for balanced future prosperity and greater social cohesion.  In addressing the challenge, our growing young and highly educated population, which is unique in Europe, gives us an enormous advantage and opportunity.  However, availing of that opportunity will require significant investment in education, not just higher education but further education and apprenticeships and an examination of the use of current resources.  The requirement for further investment in education comes at a time when despite the stabilisation of the public finances, public resources and household incomes will continue to be stretched for some time.  We will all be faced with many difficult investment choices.  Committee members do not need me to spell out the competing demands such as health services, housing, jobs and regional development.  It is necessary to evaluate where education fits in among those priorities.  To come to any conclusion on the future funding of higher education and what priority should be given, we need first to achieve a shared understanding of what we are funding and what value higher education and its different contributions offers society and the economy.  That is the main focus of the current phase of work and what I wish to brief the committee on today.<br\/><br\/>Committee members have the expert group&rsquo;s terms of reference, so I will not go through them except to say that they encompass two or three issues which are of importance to us.  First is the identification of the benefits of higher education not just to the individual but also to the wider economy and society.  We are also focusing on the examination of future demand for higher education.  I mentioned that the projections show an increase of approximately one third in the next 15 years.  We are also currently examining the potential for efficiencies and giving consideration to long-term funding options.  It would be easier if it were just a technical exercise but that is not the case.  We are required to come up with implementable options, for example, to members as public representatives, and to try to seek to build a shared understanding around those options.  As the Chair has indicated, an important aspect of the group&rsquo;s work programme is consultation with the sector itself and with the wide range of stakeholders and interested parties such as parents, students, business and regional groupings.<\/p><p>This consultation process will be ongoing as part of trying to get a shared understanding of the options.  Today is part of that consultation to brief the committee.<\/p><p> We are approaching the work programme in three phases about which I want to inform the committee as we will want to revert if we can be given the opportunity in the next phases.  The first phase is the examination of the role, value and future scale of higher education in Ireland.  We have published a consultation paper on that which the committee has received.  I will return to the key points in the paper shortly.  Following the publication of that paper, we have engaged in wide-ranging consultation.  We have had a roundtable discussion with representatives from the sector, including management, students, staff, businesses and employers, people from second level and further education, community and voluntary groups, and Departments and Government agencies.  We have also had targeted forums around these areas.  What that is giving us is a deep insight into what our people's expectations from the higher education system are and what the challenges are going to be to meet those expectations.<\/p><p> The second phase of our work programme, which we are moving into now, looks at the current operation of the system and its level of efficiency and effectiveness.  This is a very important aspect of our work because before there is any consideration of additional investment, we want to be confident that the current resources are being managed and used to best effect.  We are examining income streams into the universities and institutes of technology, the levels of expenditure, the opportunities for new working methods, including the use of technology, workload management, shared services, and regional collaboration between different institutions, to name a few.  In that context, we will be seeking to benchmark the performance of the Irish system against international comparators.  We expect to publish our second consultation paper which will address those areas in that phase in June and, again, we will have a round of consultation around that area to see the reactions and responses.  The final phase of the work will be the identification and examination of the range of options with the potential to provide a sustainable base for the funding of higher education in the long term.  For this phase, we will draw on international expertise and experience and also engage in significant consultation.  It is not just a matter for the institutions involved as to how this would happen.  It is also a matter for parents, the taxpayer and the committee members as public representatives.<\/p><p> I return briefly to some of the key elements in the paper we published in January.  It is around the role, value and scale of higher education and its contribution both to the economy and society and the challenges of maintaining and enhancing those contributions.  On the gains, there is no doubt, as members will see from the paper where we have tried to go into it in some detail, that investment in higher education has been a key in enabling both the economy to grow but also the contribution that has been made to the development of society over recent decades.  Our well-educated population remains a central plank of our national economic strategy.  As a member of the board of the IDA, I know how that comes up continually and to a greater extent sometimes than the corporation tax rate among companies with which the IDA has discussions.  Graduates' knowledge and capabilities are crucial to enhancing productivity.  The institutions themselves are central to the whole area of research and knowledge generation, but also as engines of growth regionally and in local economic development.  I will come back to the question of whether they are and how we make that happen.  In overall terms, it is clear that the State and taxpayers benefit significantly from the investment through higher tax contributions and lower calls on welfare .  However, the paper also points out that we should not just look at this in economic terms.  In social and cultural terms, there are also strong gains from having a higher education system.  Higher education informs and nurtures our understanding of our own national identity, those of other cultures and belief systems, enriches our own cultural heritage and raises the whole question not only of our history but also of our culture in other areas.<\/p><p> A significant number of graduates, in fact the majority, find employment in the public sector.  This is often something people ignore.  Higher education is instrumental in enhancing the quality and the professionalism of a great many services, particularly in education, health and public administration.  In the paper, we set out that we are looking at this as a collective public good, as a collective success for our society and in terms of the individual gains people get from having gone through higher education.  However, there are also significant personal gains.  We have shown that graduates earn more and find employment more easily in Ireland.  An honours degree is linked to earning 100% more than an adult whose highest educational attainment is the leaving certificate or its equivalent.  We have brought together a great deal of information to show the gains in terms of getting employment and the level of incomes that graduates have.<\/p><p> The paper also looks at the growing demand for higher education.  There is a strong and growing demand for higher education both from the perspective of those who are seeking to enter it, the traditional 18 year olds, and increasingly adult learners.  There is also a growing demand from the labour market for graduate education, and the consultation paper sets out a continuing demand for higher education graduates.  It is projected that nearly half of all job openings by 2025 will be for graduates.  That is a key issue we need to address.  The paper also shows that participation rates in higher education have grown year on year.  In 1980, the participation rate in higher education was 20%.  It is now 56%.  This reflects what we all know in our own family lives, which is the increasing normality of going to higher education for a much broader cohort of students.  In my own case, no one from my family, including me, went to higher education other than subsequently in terms of apprenticeships or what we called night education.  The majority of the next generation have gone to higher education, however, and have an expectation of that continuing to the next generation.  Our current demographic structure will continue to drive higher education demand over the next period.  That is unique in Europe.  We included a graph in the briefing for members to show that the future projected demand includes 30% growth in numbers over the next decade.  That is driven by demographic change alone and takes no account of any change in the participation rate.<\/p><p> It is important to mention something that we and the committee members as public representatives and policy-makers need to take into account, which is that demand for higher education is influenced by a range of alternatives for school leavers and other potential earners.  For example, we need to look at further education, apprenticeships and post-second level opportunities and to determine how those opportunities or entry points open up for people.  A strategy is being developed for further education and another is being developed around apprenticeships.  In recent years, the trend has been more towards higher education directly because the opportunities that are relevant were not there, and this must be considered in tandem with the work that we are doing.<\/p><p> We have identified four areas we believe need to be the enduring focus in terms of the quality and contribution of higher education.  The first one is very important.  It is that the quality of the provision and the quality of the graduates is what remains paramount.  It is what higher education, whether at the university or the institute of technology, is about.<\/p><p>This is the single most important way in which higher education serves students, society, taxpayers and the public good.  We need graduates who can understand our past, engage with the present, imagine the future and engage in critical thinking.  This requires renewed attention not just to what graduates learn but also to how they learn.<\/p><p> The second area is research, either in the arts and the humanities or the STEM subjects.  We suggest the institutions need to further adapt and respond to the fundamental changes taking place in innovation and how knowledge is generated.  Knowledge is not just generated in the universities or from science, engineering and technology, it happens across a range of spheres, including higher education, business, government and civil society.  It is through their overlap and engagement in all of these areas that other countries have the edge.  Interaction in an open manner in a wider range of disciplines means innovation and knowledge generation are not confined to science, technology and engineering but are extended to the arts and the humanities.  Where they overlap, we have the advantage of being able to operationalise research later.<\/p><p> Third, we require the system to be more responsive to the changing needs of the economy, society and the public system in the medium and long term.  This raises questions about how to give attention to improving the employability of graduates.  Throughout the consultation process we kept hearing that while the core discipline and qualification were important, the capacity of graduates to engage in team work, communication, accept responsibility and engage in critical thinking and problem solving were equally important.  The issue of quality, informed career guidance and support for students is also crucial and we must consider how we fund this in the future.  In that context, we must also consider regional development and what role the institutions should play in enabling regions to develop economically and socially in co-operation with businesses, Government agencies and civil society.<\/p><p> The fourth crucial area we identified was that of equitable access to the opportunities offered by higher education.  Access for persons from non-traditional backgrounds needs to be improved.  Our paper sets out the issues in this regard.  From the point of view of funding, we must acknowledge that addressing resource inequities is resource intensive.  While significant progress has been made - we received presentations from the Cork Institute of Technology, DCU, the Institute of Technology Tallaght and others on their programmes - we believe improved access for under-represented groups must be a key part of the social contract in the context of future funding improvements.  We have set this out in our consultation paper.  These are the broad issues on which we have concentrated in our consultations.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for providing us with this opportunity to give it an overview of the task the group has been given and the approach we are taking to it.  This is not just a technical exercise.  We firmly believe we need to develop a shared understanding of the role and value of higher education and the efficiency of the current system before we consider funding requirements and options for meeting these requirements.  I look forward to the discussion and hearing the committee's views on the issues raised which will be a key part of the advice we are gathering.  I would also welcome an opportunity to return to the committee as our work progresses during the year because it will provide significant options that will require consideration not just by us but also by the committee and the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>We will take questions from members and then return to Mr. Cassells for his responses to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#E00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for taking the time to make their presentation on this key issue.

Like Deputy Charlie McConalogue, I would like to know what reports were available before the expert group began its work.  There has been significant repetition, rightly so, in the first phase of its work in dealing with the role, value and scale of higher education.  We already know this and could talk about it until the cows come home.  In what way has the group used what was done before to colour what it is doing?<\/p><p>I accept that these issues need to be established, but we have established them 1,000 times at this stage.  There has been a great deal of discussion about the philosophy of education and so on, but I want to know when we will get to the meat of the issues.  Phase one really could have been completed in one day.  A postgraduate or doctorate student of education could have given the expert group a document on the philosophy of education, why we needed it and why it was so important for our burgeoning young population.  Why was so much time spent on that aspect of the work?  I realise our demographics are unusual and that there is the context of the downturn and now an apparent semi-boom to consider.  However, much of the work has already been done.<\/p><p> Mr. Cassells mentioned the reduction in higher education staff numbers during the downturn.  Was that reduction in academic, teaching or administrative staff numbers and how did it feed into the issues about which he is talking about?  It is very interesting to note that one of the greatest contributions of students in each discipline is in the area of the humanities and the arts.  That sector feeds into everything about which Mr. Cassells is talking - creativity, problem solving and team working - all of the great buzzwords.  There has been no mention, however, of what the Government has done at second level, namely, given bonus points in higher mathematics and probably science next year but not, for example, in music and the visual arts.  Most young people are opting for the arts, the humanities and languages at third level because they feed their creativity so much.<\/p><p> Mr. Cassells referred to graduates earning more than non-graduates.  I know many graduates, however, who are walking the streets looking for work.  Is Mr. Cassells referring to graduates who are working in Ireland?  If so, in which areas are they earning more and what is the percentage difference, or is he talking about graduates who have taken an aeroplane out of the country?<\/p><p> Will Mr. Cassells indicate his view on apprenticeships?  I am a great believer in apprenticeships and completely opposed to the apartheid system of education that has developed.  Some people are of the view that everybody should go to university, but not everybody wants to do so.  Apprenticeships have a great deal to offer.  How does Mr. Cassells see the role of apprenticeships in the context of the broader higher education sector?<\/p><p> How does the quality of provision and the quality of graduates correlate with the qualifications of the third level lecturers who teach them?  Is the expert group doing anything on the issue of the qualifications required by those who are moulding young minds, particularly in the liberal arts?<\/p><p> Why have we not, as other countries have done, identified the gaps, overlaps and creativities in our knowledge generation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#E00400","speaker":"1170","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cassells for his presentation.

Does Mr. Cassells concur with that view?  I am concerned that the current funding model is corporatising third level education.  In the case of NUI Galway, for example, I am told that the model is having a knock-on effect on equality issues.  Representatives of the Higher Education Authority, when they attended a meeting of the committee recently, indicated that this corporatisation was endemic across the sector.  In a context in which large multinational companies are funding universities to a great extent, we are seeing a type of boys' club growing in the sector, with less of a focus on education and more on training people for jobs.<\/p> <p>  What recommendations will the expert group be making to eliminate wasteful spending within universities?  We have heard examples of expenditure on taxis in certain third level institutions and other outrageous expense claims.  Does Mr. Cassells have proposals in that regard?<\/p> <p>  One of the cuts that really irked me in recent years was the removal of supports for postgraduate students.  This has meant that unless one has money in one's pocket, one cannot progress past undergraduate level.  It was a very retrograde step.

We had the Minister for Education and Skills in the Seanad and I did not want to miss the opportunity to ask her questions.  <\/p> <p>  I very much liked Mr. Cassells's summary of the issues, particularly his outlining of four areas on which we should focus into the future.  As other speakers noted, we have heard some of this before, but it is important to build on prior knowledge.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the apprenticeship model, I welcome the establishment by the Minister of a committee to examine the issue.  Everybody does not learn in the same way and there are very high attrition rates in first year at higher level, especially in the first term.  As I understand it, we are losing up to 30% of students from some courses, made up of 19% in institutes of technology and 11% in universities.  The word \"apprenticeship\" is anathema to some in the universities.  It seems to be a repulsive concept, with the attitude being that it is not for them.  In other countries, by contrast, PhDs are being offered at apprenticeship level.  When will we see that happen here?  We must have an education system that is for everybody, not just those who have an aptitude for academic learning.  We must open our minds in this regard.  As Mr. Cassells noted, honours degree graduates earn 100% more than those without a degree.  We must ensure there is equality of opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I concur with Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell on the teaching qualifications of lecturers.  Part of the reason for the high attrition rates is that young people are not being reached by good teaching.  Is there a basic HDip qualification for lecturers?  If there is, I do not know about it.  Does the expert group have plans in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The next issue I want to raise is a personal bugbear of mine because I have a child in this age group, as have many of my peers.  Among the 17 and 18 year olds starting college each year, there is a wide variation in maturity levels.  Once students turn 18 years, universities and institutes of technology do not give their parents information on how they are doing, even though the parents are paying the bills.  Something must be tweaked in this regard.  Once a student gets past the date of 30 October, fees kick in and if he or she subsequently realises he or she has made the wrong course choice and drops out, as so many do because of poor career guidance, low maturity levels and so on, the parents must pay the fees the following year if the student chooses to take a different course.  We must do something about this.  There must be more streamlined and effective communication between colleges, students and parents.<\/p> <p>  One of the four areas identified by Mr. Cassells was improving the employability of graduates.  When I take the train or bus to Galway, I am sometimes approached by young people who want to talk about internships.  Participants in JobBridge were paid an additional &euro;50 per week, but a person had to be in receipt of social welfare payments to qualify.  Many of these young people are not actually receiving any social welfare payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#F00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>Will the Senator focus on the issues we are discussing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#F00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I am coming to the issue of employability.

The system should be neutral to allow persons complete the undergraduate course by day or night and irrespective of how long it takes to complete it.  If someone with a family is returning to education while working part-time, a course that may take four years full-time to complete could take six years on a more flexible system, but it might be the only way that person can get an undergraduate degree.  The current system precludes that in terms of funding.  Is that issue being looked at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#G00800","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late but I have read the two papers.  My wish is that everyone who want to should go to third level.  My other wish is that most people would stay in the school system and complete the junior and leaving certificates before doing anything else.  I am disappointed that Deputy Michael Conaghan has left because he had been very involved in education all through his life, especially where I live.  He was very much the wise eyes and ears in the VEC college in Inchicore.<\/p> <p>  Many young people who had not gone through secondary school attended the VEC and came out with a great education which gave them stability.  I am looking at my own life and listening to what has been said.  I was an early school leaver.  The reality is that at the time it was all about academics.  It certainly was not about people's ability and capability.  If it had been, I probably would have been an Olympic runner or would have done the long jump or many other things.  I was interested to read the paper because for me an education is all about having a proper social life and fulfilment.  Education gives a person self-esteem, builds them up and makes them the person they did not think it was possible to be.  I know many young people who left school early and have gone back to do projects.  I have doubts about some of the projects being pursued.<\/p> <p>  Children would have been better off remaining in secondary school and completing the leaving certificate before pursuing some projects.  Education is all about social class.  In the past, the people who came from more affluent families would have gone to college while those from a lower education background did not but, thankfully, that is changing.  I see that change right across my constituency.  As parents have greater expectations for their children to continue in education, the SUSI grant is very important to them.  The more people are educated, the better society is for everyone.  People come out of it more rounded and are better able to cope with life.  I agree with the Senator who said that not everyone who has a third level degree has a brilliant job.  Many have had to leave the country.

I will respond to them as best I can.  I am taking the questions as being the committee's identification of the key issues in terms of advice to us.  This is an ongoing process and we need as much advice as possible from people as to what are the priorities.  That brings me to the first question from Deputy McConalogue.  In terms of the timeline for the final report, it is to be finished by the end of this year.  The first phase was on the role and value of education.  The second phase which will be around the effectiveness and efficiencies and how the current system operates.  We will have a consultation paper towards the end of June and would certainly welcome an opportunity to come back to the committee, as Deputy Brendan Ryan said, to discuss it because it will raise many of the issues that were raised, such as where the reductions have occurred, the balance between lecturing and administration and the balance between teaching and research.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I can link that back to the question asked.<\/p><p>Will there be recommendations or options in the final report?  Implications for the options can depend on what countries one is examining.  We were asked to do it by way of options but as a group we wanted these as implementable options.  In a sense, it would have been easy to do this as a technical exercise and tell Oireachtas Members that these are the options they need to implement.  However, we need to drill down into each of the options as to their advantages, disadvantages and how they might operate in an Irish context.  An option that may be successful abroad may not operate in an Irish context.  For example, Ireland&rsquo;s demographics and growing population have a different implication and set of pressures for funding than in Germany where the population is falling.  We need to drill down into all of that for Oireachtas Members so that when they come to make a decision on this, they have all this information.  It will be as close to recommendations that one could get without our group declaring them to be recommendations.<br\/><br\/>A range of reports were done by the HEA the Irish Universities Association and others over several years on the sustainability of the system and on demographics.  Unfortunately, none of those reports pulled the whole thing together.  The reason we started with phase 1 on the role, the value and the scale of third level education was to pull all these reports together to say this is the historical evolution of the higher education system, this is what it should be and its values.  We had many discussions and arguments with the various groupings on this.  We were clear that the value is both for a collective societal good and individual gain.  The system has in a sense strayed into individual gain as opposed to society investing in a proper system.<br\/><br\/>We are now moving into the phase of examining the efficiencies and effectiveness of the system.  This ties into the reduction in funding and the increase in student numbers with the impact on teaching quality.  This will be dealt with it in some detail in the report.  The question of the staff-student ratio, namely the numbers lecturers have to deal with, as well as the capacity for smaller group and one-to-one interaction, is having an impact on teaching quality.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donnell asked, the question that keeps on arising is does one professionalise the teaching aspect.  In Australia, they have professionalised teaching with little involvement in research.  Some groupings have argued for this with us while others have argued it should be teaching and research.  Others argued there should be research-led teaching so that it is up-to-date with the most recent developments in an area.  Others argued that those engaged in key research should be exempted from teaching.  It is interesting that some of the top research people have said they want to teach because that is their whole <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre<\/i>for being involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#G02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#H00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#H00300","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429704000,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>We have had a detailed briefing on the whole area of online programmes and MOOCs, massive open online courses.  There is a need for blended learning.  In other words, how does one use the technology as it will never operate on its own in the delivery of and accessing higher education?  It will also require significant investment.  Some submissions argued technology would reduce costs and one would not need funding.  In fact, all the information shows it would require significant investment.  One will never be able to provide it in such a way that there is no blended interaction between teaching and that technology is an enabler that does not take over from what is happening.<\/p> <p>  We looked at various international models from systems that are wholly publicly funded, as in Norway for example, to systems where it is a contribution from the student and parents to systems where these contributions are underpinned by a loan system such as in Australia and the UK.  We need to examine the advantages and disadvantages of these options but, equally, their applicability in an Irish context.  It is useless if our group gives Oireachtas Members a set of options if they cannot see clearly the impact in an Irish context.<\/p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of loans and a graduate tax.  Again, this is an issue which we will be examining but we do not have a view on it yet.  Members would be highly critical of us if we submitted a report that did not consider the advantages and disadvantages of the various options.  All of the options will be examined but I cannot say at this stage how they might float.  For example, the loans issue has much wider implications than what we can say about the repayment or level of those loans.  If the State provides it, then one is into significant borrowing.  That would that be an issue in an Irish context.  Do we add significantly to our national debt to establish such a system?  These are the issues which we must probe and, due to their complexity, is why it has taken us time to come up with implementable options.<\/p> <p>  The issue of wasteful spending was also raised.  We are looking at the effectiveness of income streams, expenditure, workloads and the regional provision of different programmes in the next phase.  We will also be examining postgraduate grants and part-time education.  I was on the group which came up with the national strategy for higher education.  One of the key elements around that was the flexibility of access and being able to enter the system through any route, whether it was through an apprenticeship and moving up, or further education and moving indirectly, or another stage in life.<\/p><p>There was also the need to ensure there was equity in terms of how everybody was treated.  I know that from personal experience as I had to access higher education through the part-time route.  In the report we will address both the costs involved and how those costs could be met.  <\/p><p> On the question of apprenticeships, on one level one could argue that as an expert group on future funding of higher education, we must deal with issues from the viewpoint of funding, but the reason we have raised this issue in the first report is that demographics alone and the young population are driving a 30% increase in the numbers who want to avail of post leaving certificate opportunities, let us call it tertiary education.  One cannot have a situation where the only route, not only from the point of view of funding but from what is right, would be to go straight to university or to an institute of technology.  A strategy and a policy has been and is being developed on apprenticeships and another for further education.  The point being made, which is crucially important, is the traditional view of apprenticeships as being in the crafts area versus apprenticeships in a range of areas across the spectrum of higher apprenticeships and also to industrial degrees, as they are called in Denmark.  In other words that one can take apprenticeship training up to degree level and, as the Senator mentioned, up to PhD level.<\/p><p> A question was asked about NUIG and the bypass.  I think the Senator will accept that I will bypass that for the moment.  The reason I am responding to it is that we will be looking at the issue of capital expenditure, in other words if one takes the whole question of expenditure on infrastructure in our institutes of technology and universities, where will the expenditure come from, what is needed?  What are the future requirements and how would one source the funding for the future requirements?<\/p><p> The issue of infrastructure will come up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Cassells","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>Mr. Cassells did not address the question of qualifications of the lecturers.

Reform of SUSI and the grant system is a key issue for USI.  It is no secret that there were some teething problems with SUSI in the beginning.  However, since then things have vastly improved and USI has a very good and positive working relationship with SUSI.  However, there are still many flaws and students continue to fall through the cracks.  At last year's annual USI congress the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, challenged USI to formulate papers offering solutions to the issues about which we were concerned.  We did this with our NERI paper on publicly funded education and we are here today with our paper and proposals for reform of the grant scheme legislation.<\/p> <p>  Access to higher education is a core component of USI's work.  Based on our work on the ground we can say that the present financial support structure is not working optimally.  The student maintenance grant has been cut significantly over the past decade at a time when the cost of living has increased and rental accommodation costs have risen by an average 10% nationally over the past 12 months.  The proposals in this paper seek to rectify some of the inequalities and problems that exist within the current requirements for the student maintenance grant.  What we describe to the committee today, as outlined in our grant reform paper, are issues many members of the committee have come across in their constituency offices.  From studying the replies to parliamentary questions and the minutes of previous meetings here we can see that the issues we outline come up repeatedly and are dealt with on a case by case basis.  We are proposing a structural reform for many of these areas rather than continuing down the arduous road of solving each issue as it comes up.<\/p> <p>  The issue of main concern to students and the USI is that of the adjacency rate regulations.  To receive the non-adjacent rate applicants must have a home address more than 45 km as the crow flies from their place of study.  This distance was extended from 24 km to 45 km in budget 2011.  The extension of the adjacency rate has had a profound impact on those not living in the greater Dublin area or the east coast of Ireland where incomes are lower and grant dependency is higher.  In rural areas distances as the crow flies rarely equate to a consistent travel experience between locations.<\/p> <p>  For example, Dungloe in County Donegal falls within the 45 km of Letterkenny as the crow flies but the distance travelled is nearly 80 km.  Those who dwell on islands are not automatically allocated the non-adjacent rate.  For example the Aran Islands are considered adjacent to Galway city even though it requires a ferry journey.<\/p> <p>  To tackle these issues we propose: a full reinstatement of old 24 km rate; change 45 km to travel distance not geographical distance; entitlement of non-adjacent rate to those living on islands; and reinstatement of the entitlement of mature students to the non-adjacent rate which was also cut in budget 2011.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of independence and estrangement, currently, a student must have turned 23 years old on 1 January preceding the start of the course to be considered as an independently supported student.  Students must provide evidence of their independence to the satisfaction of the grant authority.  The problem lies with the standard of evidence SUSI requires.  Students applying as estranged from their parents, must evidence it by documentation such as letters and-or reports from the Garda, social workers, the HSE or a court order.  The number of students affected by estrangement is low, but seeking out excessive verifications of this often distressing period in their life can have a profound effect on them and their studies.<\/p> <p>  At a meeting between with the HEA and USI, SUSI accepted that the standards for approving estrangement are too high.  We propose that the Minister for Education and Skills send out clear guidelines to grant authorities which could give more allowances to applicants trying to evidence estrangement.<\/p> <p>  Proving independence can be an onerous task, particularly for mature students.  In the current legislation anyone living in the parental home is assessed on his or her parents' income as a dependent student.  This does not take into account a number of issues such as lone parents going through a separation who may move into their parents' home for a short period in order to tide them over during their marital relationship breakdown.  Nor does it take into account that some people live at home as carers.<\/p> <p>  USI recommends that students over the age of 23 who are classed as mature students should be assessed on their personal income and not that of their parents or have their community welfare officer determine independent living.<\/p> <p>  Postgraduate fees and supports have already been mentioned at the committee today.  At a time when we are building a knowledge and skills-based economy that can compete internationally, postgraduate qualifications are becoming the norm in many sectors.  Unfortunately the postgraduate maintenance grant was abolished in budget 2012 and the following year postgraduate applications by 15% to 20%.  The reduction was 19% in NUIG and approximately 13% in UCD.  There are different income limits for those in undergraduate study from those pursuing a postgraduate qualification.  USI recommends that these income limits be brought in line with each other and be the same as the undergraduate limit.<\/p> <p>  Our document outlines further issues regarding social welfare payments and cut-off rates.<\/p> <p>  The loss of a parent's support through death or marital breakdown can have a significant detrimental impact on a student's ability to continue with studies.  Students who suffer the death of a parent must account for all incomes, including a widow's pension during reassessment.  USI recommends that extra payments and one-off payments such as a widow's pension should not be included in the reassessment of a student.<\/p> <p>  In one case in my institution, UCC, a student was asked to provide a coroner's report in order to prove the death of her father.  The distress this caused her and her family eventually led to her dropping out of her course.  The only evidence a student should ever be required to produce is a death certificate.  The grant scheme has no guidelines on marital breakdown.  This can be a particularly stressful time for students.  We request that the Minister for Education and Skills should issue guidelines to SUSI on how to evidence separation.<\/p><p>On assets as a possible route of determining means-based eligibility, USI has cautioned against proceeding with this without first setting up a feasibility group of relevant stakeholders.  Assets should not be assessed if they are the primary source of income for a family.<\/p><p> What I have outlined here is only a summary of what committee members got in the paper.  It is quite long so I will not continue for much longer.  I wish to thank the Chairperson and other committee members for giving us a chance to talk to them today.  We look forward to answering any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Annie Hoey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hoey and Mr. Stitt for attending the committee today.  The USI paper was excellent.  Last night, I spoke at the USI student achievement awards and there has been an increasing professionalisation from that organisation over the past year, which is really positive.  It is useful for us, rather than criticising the system, to propose changes that can actually be made.  I have a couple of questions.  Has this presentation gone to the Minister yet?  If so, what kind of feedback, if any, has the USI had?  Has the USI been promised any level of engagement to get a response from the Department on the individual recommendations, and the same with SUSI?<\/p> <p>  I would like to get more detail on the issue of estrangement.  When SUSI's representatives attended this committee a few months ago, I raised this issue with them.  They acknowledged that the current system has its problems and should be changed.  Perhaps the USI representatives can provide more details on how an alternative system could work.  Obviously it is difficult and there are sensitivities there, particularly if a person does not have relationships.  The whole point of estrangement is that they do not have a relationship with their parents so they may not be able to get co-operation from them in obtaining the type of documentation they need to prove that.  It would be helpful therefore is the USI could give us more details on that matter.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hoey went through each of the areas in considerable detail, which is helpful.  We can discuss this in private session, but I propose that the committee should forward the USI paper to the Department and seek its formal response on whether it agrees with the recommendations.  <\/p> <p>  The question of assets is always a sensitive one.  Coming from Dublin, I know there has always been a sense that PAYE workers - the people whose income is entirely transparent - are hard done by and that others have been able to manage assets.  There were revelations of particular examples of that in the book published by the last Minister's special adviser.  An example was given of somebody from a farming background who had considerable assets and how such people are able to work the current system.  Does the USI have any sense that there is a willingness to change that?  What would a fairer system look like?  What would the USI propose in order to treat assets fairly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#L00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>I thank the USI representatives very much.

I am sure they have many such examples and picked out very relevant ones.<\/p> <p>  I am interested that the USI representatives did not mention the disgraceful behaviour of the banks on undergraduate and postgraduate grants, which is a bugbear of mine.  Even more disgraceful is that bank interest rates are at one level when undergraduates are studying, but they are increased when students qualify.  Banks now have branches on university campuses all over the country.  At the moment, people are trying to convince the Government to change all kinds of variable rates, so this locks into what the USI representatives are talking about here.  Perhaps they could elaborate on it.  Well done to them.

As a member of the Government side, I cannot always agree with what comes in this format, but the presentation is worth reading.  It is something to chew over when considering reform.  I will be raising it in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.<\/p> <p>  It may not be Government policy, but I agree with Ms Hoey that mature students should be assessed on their personal income and not on their parents' income.  I have always believed that.  It is shocking at times that young people are seen as leaning on their parents for everything.  Many young people are independent and want to be seen as such, even though they might live at home.

I am wearing two hats because I am listening to the USI as a parent who currently has three children in third-level education.  Hopefully, I will have a fourth in third-level in September.  I concur with what the USI is seeking, which is realistic.  My 23-year-old daughter was judged as being ineligible because she is living at home, yet she does everything independently.  That is the case with many 23-year-olds.  On the one hand we are constantly saying \"be as independent as you can\", but on the other hand they are not being given the opportunities.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hoey referred to adjacent rates and said that people who live on islands do not necessarily qualify for NUIG, but that beggars belief.

We should forward it to the Department and seek costings for the various USI proposals.<\/p> <p>  The issue of independence always jumps out at me.  I have come across a number of such cases with under-23s.  Last year, I remember one case involving a 22 year old man who was living with his partner and two children.  He was being assessed on his parents' income and his own income, but one cannot stand over such things.  There are a number of instances like that every year.  Likewise for the over-23s, difficulties arise every year concerning people's ability to provide evidence of not being domiciled with their parents.  They are falling through the cracks and as a result of that they are excluded.  There is a common problem in that the Department sets the terms of reference for the grant scheme to SUSI.  SUSI implements it rigidly so there is no buffer zone between the Department and SUSI to assess extreme cases.  It is black and white, and as a result many people cannot access the system.<\/p><p>I thank the delegation for putting the proposal together which we will promote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#L00600","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1124,"content":"<p>I concur with other members that the proposal is practical and pragmatic, but I do not agree with all of it.  The setting up of SUSI has possibly made the system more transparent; therefore, we can have more confidence in it, unlike the old one.  Also, the demographics have changed in how grants are awarded, which says something about the system in place prior to the setting up of SUSI.<\/p><p>USI's view of assets is a fudge.  I have attended briefings by it and believe there is a battle within it.  Those running it favour the <i>status quo,<\/i>which very much means that the system favours people living in rural areas as opposed to those living in urban areas under the PAYE system and that it also favours the the self-employed.  In this regard, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence and some stories do stack up.  I refer to the children of doctors receivng grants as opposed to somebody who is the child of a bus driver.  Such claims lead to a question mark being placed over the current system.  That is the only difficulty I have with the proposal.  The USI should show leadership in the issue.  It should outline what is the right thing to do and decide whether assets should form part of the picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#M00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429704000,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>I will address the questions as I received them.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Averil Power asked whether the presentation had been sent to the Minister.  The USI president presented it to her, although they have had only informal discussions up to this point.  However, nothing concrete, in terms of a recommendation or favourable decisions, has yet been fed back to us.  We will have further sit-downs with the Minister, but we just wanted to bring the paper to the committee to obtain feedback.<\/p> <p>  The issue of estrangement was mentioned.  It is a massive problem but not something with which I would dare to become involved.  There is no formal recognition or certification process in Irish law where someone is estranged from his or her parents.  That is where students fall between the cracks.  SUSI may ask for Garda reports or reports by the HSE or a social worker, but it might be the case that none of them has had dealings with certain people.  The Garda will not issue a letter to the effect that a person is estranged if it has not dealt with the person involved.  I know that a number of students have given evidence to the effect that they are estranged, but it has not been deemed acceptable by SUSI.  We will definitely ask the Minister to look at the existing guidelines and the process followed by SUSI in this matter.  I suggest the guidelines abe widened.  We should generally accept anything that can act as evidence of estrangement and SUSI should be eligible to make an informed decision.  Before now we believed its process was too stringent.  A number of the claims are being referred to the completely impartial grant appeals board which is an arm of the Department of Education and Skills.  We do not want cases to constantly have go through that arm of the Department because the standards of SUSI are too high.<\/p> <p>  I shall reply to the points made by the Chairman.  On assets, I completely understand the concerns expressed.  What we have included in the paper might not be considered to be committed to any strategy or attack on the issue.  USI has, however, been pragmatic.  We realise there is a certain pot of money available for student supports and that if a student receives a grant fraudulently, there will be less available for those students really in need.  In that respect, we want the matter to be dealt with where fraudulent claims of income are supplied or where applications are submitted by what I have termed \"asset rich families\".  We do not want a farmer to be told he or she has too much land and must sell a fraction of it to fund a college education for his or her children.  Equally, we do not want someone who owns a local newsagents to do the same.  There is no difference between owning farmland and a local business; in that context, there is no rural-urban divide.  We should not jump into such a strategy willy-nilly.  We do not want to have a situation where people will have to sell land or a business to support a student in his or her college years.  We are pressing to have a group of relevant stakeholders brought together by the Minister and the matter fully discussed.  We want a strategic point of attack in legislation which will not affect the person reliant on his or her farmland or family business but rather the person who owns a classic car collection.  We need to sit down and properly discuss the matter.  It would be inappropriate to proceed without first outlining the background.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell mentioned interest rates.  That matter has not been brought into the foreground.  Grants are provided by local authorities or the grants authority, SUSI.  We have position papers on State-backed loans and banks giving out loans.  We hold certain positions on the matter, but they are based purely on the provision of students supports and grants.  That is why we did not deal with the matter earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Stitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429704000,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>We mentioned mature students and their personal income, an issue we have found to be problematic.  Last week I attended the forum on lone parents organised by Senator Katherine Zappone, at which I heard alarming stories which I had not heard before.  I heard about a woman who had gone through a marital breakdown.  She lived at home for about one month to try to sort herself out.  As a result of living at home she lost rent supplement and was deemed to be dependent on her father, even though she was in her thirties.  This had left her incredibly distressed.  She was pregnant at the time and also had a four year old child.  The upheaval had had an impact on her ability to cope.  She ended up having to take a year out to reassess where she was going and try to get back on track.  Someone should never have to take a year out to sign on to become eligible to continue his or her education.<\/p> <p>  There is a similar problem in providing proof of independence.  It is difficult to move straightaway from being an undergraduate to a postgraduate student.  No student should have to sign on for one year to prove he or she is independent from his or her parents.  It does not make sense that people must do this to prove they are independent.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of added years has caused confusion.  My sister had such a problem.  She was told there was no support available and was unable to find any information online.  If grant authorities cannot find the information, students definitely will not be able to find it, which is worrying.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of mitigating circumstances, people do not necessarily repeat just because they are lazy or having a great time.  There are serious reasons such as marital breakdown, the loss of a parent, illness, etc.  Such circumstances have a massive impact on the ability of students to return to education.  I started college in 2006 and every year since I have seen students drop out for personal reasons.  They were of the view that they would not receive the support needed to continue studying.<\/p><p>We get telephone calls all the time from students on courses at level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications who wish to avail of the option of doing an additional year to obtain a level 8 qualification.  It seems, however, that as far as SUSI is concerned, that add-on year amounts to a whole new course and participants are no longer eligible for existing supports.  Everything essentially goes flying out the window.  We would like to see clarity in respect of all courses that have the option of an add-on year, so that people are not left in a situation where their supports are withdrawn.  Students often commence a course in an institute of technology because of the points level, because it is local to them and so on, with the intention of proceeding to level 8 by way of the conversion year.  After completing three years, however, they are told they no longer qualify for support.  That is not acceptable.  We are talking about a continuation of the same course, albeit perhaps with a slightly different name.  We would like to see an awareness on the part of SUSI that this option is available and an accommodation of it, rather than having this back and forth we are seeing at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Annie Hoey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429704000,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>Senator Moran asked about adjacency rates.  When the decision was made to extend the distance criterion from 24 km to 45 km, the implication was that all students living within 45 km of their college are expected to commute.  That is not realistic in many cases, however, because a distance of 45 km as the crow flies might not translate to a reasonable commute.  In Galway, where I live, parts of east Clare are within 45 km of the college campus.  However, anybody who knows Galway knows there is the ring around Galway Bay and factors like that to consider.  We already gave the example of Dungloe in west Donegal, which is an 80 km round trip for students of Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  That is not really a reasonable proposition.  We have estimated the fuel and public transport costs and the options available to students living these types of distances from their college.  In some cases, people would not be able to make it in time for their lectures or would be very late arriving home.  In the case of Dundalk Institute of Technology, students living in Drogheda no longer qualify for support.  This is a harsh measure which has bluntly cut out a lot of students or seen a slashing of their grant payment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue suggested that the committee might be able to obtain some additional costings from the Department, which we would greatly appreciate.  In terms of the adjustment in respect of the adjacency rate, the appropriate calculations would have been included in the budget costings.  I understand the adjacency rate saving is a projected &euro;12 million per year and &euro;50 million over four years.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how students aged over 23 can prove they are living independently of their parents for the purpose of qualifying for grant support, we would recommend that they be able to approach their local community welfare officer, who could verify on the student's behalf, on the basis of the evidence presented, that the student is living independently.  This might involve the welfare officer putting a stamp on a form and submitting it to SUSI.  One of the difficulties many people have with the new regime is that the centralisation of the process means they can no loner go into their local authority office and meet a person face to face and get an issue sorted.  It is only possible now to talk to somebody by telephone, which means the personal touch is gone.  Where we formerly had that type of sit-down contact there was more scope for flexibility, discussions could be had and a decision might be made there and then rather than having to send off documents and wait weeks for a response.  I have suggested that community welfare officers might be the persons best suited to assist students in these matters because they would have sufficient training and expertise to provide assistance and, in a context where we are seeing a reduction in the numbers on the live register, they might be in a position to offer that assistance.  While welfare officers were among the busiest of civil servants in recent years, they might now have the time to perform this role.<\/p> <p>  We would be strongly in favour of a situation where decisions by SUSI are more transparent.  We certainly do not want to see a situation where it is left to the authority of SUSI to define the standards.  Where those standards are too high, the Minister and the Department should be free to administer guidelines in that regard.  Certainly, in the case of establishing estrangement or independence from parents, the standards are far too high.  SUSI has a massive labour force and it seems to us that staff are essentially given a party line.  They are told, for example, that if a student wants to prove estrangement, he or she must do X, Y and Z and there is no flexibility in it.  Instead, in these types of cases, any evidence that it is possible to provide should be considered.  When SUSI has been challenged on this issue, it has claimed it will accept any evidence.  However, in our experience, that is not what is happening when students initiate the assessment process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015042200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Stitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1429704000,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentation, their useful and pragmatic report and their engagement with members.

These engagements allowed my team and me to explain as openly and frankly as possible our strategy to stabilise the bank and ultimately to move to a position of sustainability.  Our discussions with the committee informed and helped frame our subsequent decision-making.  We did not always necessarily agree but we have held a common goal to rebuild AIB from its distressed state after the crisis into a profitable bank equipped to support the Irish economy, to prioritise professional service for our customers and, over time, to seek to return to the Irish taxpayers the support they provided in such large measure.   My colleagues have been introduced by the Chairman so I will not repeat those introductions.<\/p> <p>  I am prepared to leave AIB in the confidence that the management team will continue to lead the bank towards delivering our strategic objectives, putting our customers at the heart of our business and playing a pivotal role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  After a period of transformation over the past three years, the bank&rsquo;s financial performance has improved, with profits before tax in 2014 of &euro;1.1 billion.  The bank&rsquo;s impaired loan balances have been reduced by 23% to &euro;22.2 billion during the year and lending approvals stand at over &euro;13 billion.  Progress has been made in reducing mortgage arrears with a 22% reduction in arrears for private dwelling homes in Ireland in 2014 and the bank is in a position for the first time to make a &euro;280 million cash payment to the State on the preference shares.<\/p> <p>  AIB&rsquo;s recovery over the past number of years has had to be a fine balancing act.  Most obvious, it had to be done in tandem with implementing solutions for customers in financial difficulties while protecting taxpayers&rsquo; capital and, at all times, attempting to return the financial metrics of the bank to sustainable levels both in terms of margin and the bank&rsquo;s cost base.  It is particularly appropriate that AIB has this forum, at this time, to set out its perspective in terms of a number of issues that are currently the subject of widespread public debate.  We have already sent the committee detailed responses to its advance queries but I would like to highlight a number of issues. <\/p> <p>  Let me begin with the mortgage interest rate charges and, in particular, the standard variable rate.  First and foremost, let me explain that AIB&rsquo;s mortgage pricing reflects consideration of a number of points, the first being the cost of risk attached to a loan.  The impact of the recession on the mortgage market in Ireland triggered one of the highest loan arrears and default rates in Europe and, unfortunately, as a result, the level of risk in lending to Irish mortgage customers is proportionally higher than the rest of Europe and has to be factored into our pricing decisions.  Thankfully this cost of risk is declining as economic conditions improve and arrears levels reduce.  The bank remains focused on further reducing the level of arrears and impaired loans on its balance sheet in the coming period.<\/p><p> The operating costs of running AIB were &euro;1.4 billion in 2014.  This represents a reduction of &euro;350 million compared to 2012 levels, following a significant reduction in head count, general administrative costs and progress towards a more efficient operating model.  The bank remains focused on ensuring the group is run as efficiently as possible from a cost perspective, while ensuring its customer service levels are appropriate and its systems and processes are robust.<\/p><p>  Given its credit rating, the cost of funding for AIB is different to the simple average of other banks across Europe.  The narrative that AIB is able to fund itself at the ECB base rate is simply not the case and is an overly simplistic assessment of a much broader set of circumstances.  It is important to note that only 3% of AIB&rsquo;s funding is sourced from the ECB.  This is an important point to consider in regard to the debate later today.  The bank&rsquo;s funding costs have certainly improved over the past number of years and it remains focused on further reductions, based on market conditions.<\/p><p> On the need to generate sustainable and viable returns for shareholders, AIB as a commercial and systemically important institution must ensure that lending is at sustainable rates to ensure it is able to generate a return for shareholders but also to rebuild its capital in order to insulate against any future adverse shocks.  AIB&rsquo;s net interest margin in 2014 of 1.69%, excluding ELG costs, increased in the year, but was still below average bank levels across Europe.  Given AIB is currently 99.8% owned by the State, the majority of any profits generated by the bank are ultimately to the benefit of the State.  In incorporating lessons learned from the recent painful past, the bank cannot return to a situation where its lending decisions are being undertaken on any basis other than a medium to long-term view of sustainability and viability.<\/p><p> Over the past number of years, the bank has worked to improve all of these metrics in the context of creating a sustainable business model capable of supporting economic recovery while also seeking to create an investable model so that over time the bank can start to return capital to the State.  As a result of the bank&rsquo;s underlying positive performance and improvements in funding costs and the cost of risk, in December 2014, AIB, EBS and Haven implemented a number of reductions to mortgage rates.  For example, the move meant savings of approximately &euro;330 per annum for customers with a mortgage of &euro;200,000 on a 25 year term.  If a customer with a similar mortgage chose to move to a two or three year fixed rate option of 3.8%, this would have resulted in savings of &euro;800 per annum.  Importantly, the reductions we implemented benefitted both new and existing customers.<\/p><p> Further rate reductions for AIB customers, existing and new, are something that my team and I continue to consider.  However, it is critical to bear in mind just where this bank has come from.  In just over a three year period, AIB has moved from reporting multi-billion euro losses to &euro;1.1 billion in profit in 2014 - into profit for the first time in a number of years.  Considering all of the factors outlined, when the appropriate opportunity arose late last year, we moved to cut variable mortgage interest rates for our customers.  We must maintain a balance between securing the bank&rsquo;s present and future financial health, preserving and building capital to fuel the economy and repaying the State the sums invested in the bank, while all the time providing our customers with appropriate and sustainable lending rates in the market. <\/p><p> The bank is carefully monitoring the variable components that influence interest rates and will act accordingly in favour of our customers on mortgage rates.  We did so after looking at the facts involving all of the elements I have outlined in this letter.  There is no ECB rate.  It is just not relevant to AIB and we are not funding at some cheap rate in Europe.  That is just 3% of our funding.  We have a much higher funding rate and in addition we have the cost of risk and the cost of running the bank.  We can only charge a rate above those costs if we are to maintain a margin.  If we charge below those costs, we will have a loss making bank.  Previous tracker rates are an example of that, where the cost of funding, the risk cost and the management of the bank costs were higher than the rates charged on tracker mortgages.  We do not want to go to that place again.<\/p><p> That said, as we looked at the four elements to which I referred earlier, the last variable rate cut we made was when we looked at those elements and asked whether if we made a rate cut we would still maintain a position of sustainable profitability in the bank.  If so, we could pass on that rate cut to our customers.  Our principles have been to run the bank on a commercially viable basis, with sustainable profitability and yet to be fair and equitable in the treatment of our customers.  That is how we arrived at our decision of December 2014.  As we look at the variables, we see a continuing positive trend this year.  We will consider those four variables and if we see that trend continue over the next couple of months, towards our half year financial year, we will consider making a further rate cut.  However, that will be decided on the basis of those variables, cost of funding, our cost to manage the bank and our risk operating costs.  If all of those costs reduce, as they have in the past, we will be willing to consider another rate cut in the next couple of months.  We will look at our financial performance in that window.<\/p><p> This completes my additional supplement, which I make for the sake of clarity, as our position seems to have been defined in the media.  I would rather it be clear today, but we can discuss it further.<\/p><p> I also want to refer to the question of mortgage arrears.  Apart from dealing with the commercial impact of distressed loans on the bank&rsquo;s balance sheet, we absolutely share concerns at the societal consequences of the ongoing difficulties associated with legacy debt.  Reflecting this concern, our trained staff deal with customers who continue to experience financial stress and we work tirelessly to arrive at sustainable solutions that will allow them to emerge from arrears.  I have said it many times before and reiterate again today that AIB aims to keep people in their homes where possible, if customers engage with us.  With that as our primary motive, we have put in place what we believe to be the most comprehensive set of permanent arrears solutions in the market.  Where there is no affordability of any form of mortgage repayment, a loss of ownership may be the appropriate solution, but we believe we have a pragmatic approach to residual debt, recognising that one cannot restructure where there is no affordability. <\/p><p> We have engaged with third party channels such as the IMHO for those customers who feel they cannot come directly to the bank.  We pause the legal process when customers engage with us and enter a sustainable restructuring arrangement.  While we have much more to do, the success of this approach is borne out in our most recent set of results, with overall arrears levels in our mortgage portfolio in the Republic reducing by 18% in 2014 and owner-occupier arrears falling by 22% and buy-to-let arrears down by 7%.<\/p><p> Similarly, as we seek to protect employment and viable businesses, solid progress was achieved for non-mortgage customers who typically have exposures across a number of asset classes, including SME debt, associated properties and buy-to-let mortgages.  At the end of last year, a total of &euro;4.7 billion of non-mortgage loans were subject to forbearance and we continue to constructively engage to offer restructures to our customers in 2015.  The improving economic climate in Ireland is translating into an increased appetite for credit, with growth in the personal, business and corporate banking segments of the market.  In 2014, we approved over &euro;13 billion of lending in Ireland and our lending draw downs to our customers were 42% higher than the previous year, including our mortgage and business customers.  We continue to have capacity to lend and we remain focused on supporting our customers, jobs and the broader Irish economy.  These figures are reflective not only of the improving economic backdrop in our main markets of Ireland and the UK but also speaks to the underlying ability of the bank to lend prudently to our customers in the future. <\/p><p> While the bank has made enormous progress in recent years, we are planning for the challenges that lie ahead.  We continue to focus on rebuilding the trust and confidence of our customers and improving customer service levels.  We have previously indicated that we are in discussions with the Department of Finance over the future capital structure of the bank and while I am not in a position to discuss this in any detail, these considerations are continuing.<\/p><p> On behalf of AIB, I want to express thanks to the committee for inviting us here today and for the huge support the State has given this bank.  On a personal level, I want to acknowledge the help of the Oireachtas in the course of my work as chief executive of AIB over the past three years.  The bank will continue to approach with vigour the challenges ahead.  As a public company with a commercial mandate, AIB has to balance the requirement of generating value for our shareholders, most principally the Irish taxpayer, with the requirements of our customers who also need the support of the bank.<\/p><p> In summary, AIB today is a profitable business, generating capital for shareholders.  It has received EU approval for its restructuring plan, has passed the ECB stress tests, is reducing arrears levels and overall levels of impaired loans and is well positioned from a funding, capital and liquidity perspective to prudently lend over time and support the country&rsquo;s economic recovery.  We look forward to any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429707600,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>I remind members, witnesses and visitors in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off.

Three weeks ago, Fianna F&aacute;il, as an Opposition party, dedicated its Private Members' time in the D&aacute;il to a full debate on the issue of variable mortgage rates.  I will put a number of matters to Mr. Duffy to which I ask him to respond.  <\/p> <p>  Most people on a variable rate mortgage understand that the interest rate they pay will move in line with market conditions.  When conditions are bad, they expect the rate to increase and when they improve, they expect the rate to reduce.  The standard variable rate is not like the tracker rate, which is linked to the rate set by the European Central Bank.  There are approximately 300,000 variable rate mortgage customers in Ireland, of whom approximately 140,000 are with Allied Irish Banks.  These customers are paying far in excess of the variable rates charged elsewhere in the eurozone where the average variable rate is 2.09%.  AIB is not the worst offender in this regard and the bank has reduced its rates recently.  I commend it on reducing its variable rate for existing and new customers, especially as some other banks have existing customers paying a standard variable rate of 4.5%.  These banks will be challenged on that matter. <\/p> <p>  The cost of funds to Allied Irish Banks is declining and currently stands at 1.57% according to the bank's figures.  Its net interest margin is increasing and currently stands at 1.69%.  Will Mr. Duffy take us through the sources of AIB's funds and the cost of each source?  Customer accounts provide 63% of the bank's funding.  What is the cost of this saver and deposit base?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#C00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Mark Bourke to provide a build-up and help Deputy McGrath see through how we build our costs and ultimately how we charge for the rates.  I will provide some context for Mr. Bourke.  To put this in simple business terms, the way we look at this as a business is that one has a cost of risk.  Even in good times, one has mortgages that do not work and different kinds of loan defaults.  One then has the running costs to the bank and the costs of the funds one acquires.  These three costs need to be considered when one tunes to one's total cost.  That is normal business.  The bank then charges a rate for its product.  If one looks across Allied Irish Banks, we have those three costs.  As I stated, the European Central Bank rate is simply not relevant because we only source 3% of funding from the ECB.  When we add up the three costs to which I referred and then look at the rates across all our products, we arrive at a figure of 1.6% for the net interest margin, which is at the lower end of the average among our peers.<\/p> <p>  I want to provide context by stating that we are not trying to get to the point of making tremendous profits for a shareholder valuation.  We are looking for sustainable profitability and wish to be fair.  As was the case with the previous cut, if these costs come down, we will try to contribute by giving a rate cut to our mortgage customers. <\/p> <p>  Mr. Bourke will provide the science of how this builds up to provide some clarity for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>The best way to break this down is probably to start with the 1.57% figure.

There is no difference between the fixed and the variable rates.  The cost of funding has definitely come down.  Am I correct that in January 2015, AIB raised &euro;750 million at a cost of 0.625% and in March 2015 the bank raised &euro;500 million at 1.375%?  Both rates are a good bit lower than the current 1.57% cost of funding that the bank uses at present.  AIB has been restructured significantly and the rate of 1.57% that the bank is quoting for the cost of funding is basically the 2014 rate for the cost of funding.  We represent the ordinary person who goes to the bank and sees that a fixed rate mortgage rate is lower than or equal to the variable rate, which on the face of it does not appear to make sense unless the bank knows that the rates are going to drop and they are possibly taking profit from the variable mortgages at the variable mortgage holder's expenses.<\/p> <p>  The bank is raising funds in 2015 at significantly lower rates than applied in 2014.  I cannot see why AIB Bank needs to wait until the announcement of the results for the first six months when it is clearly evident that the bank has factored in that the rates are coming down and the restructuring costs have come down.  We meet ordinary people who have mortgages.  A situation can arise where a number of people have the same level of mortgage, which is not very large, and the person on a variable rate may be paying &euro;300 to &euro;600 more per month than the person on the tracker mortgage.

As the owners of the bank, I think we need to recognise there has been a very significant turnaround.  I would like to also recognise the introduction of the debt-for-equity product.  I know the numbers are still small but my understanding is that they are growing and it is obviously something we raised at the committee some time ago.  AIB's look at the post-retirement period is also something that was raised at this committee and was something AIB acted on, which was very welcome.<\/p> <p>  The JV with the IMHO is very welcome and I am glad to hear that Mr. Duffy considers it a success.

At the same time, the ECB rate has come down by 70 basis points.  I appreciate it is only 3% of the funding but, at the same time, risk has obviously fallen dramatically for a variety of reasons, including the significant increase in house values, operating costs are down, provisioning requirements are down and, I imagine, there will be a significant rewind this year.  I think it was Bank of Ireland that had a &euro;280 million release of provisioning, so I presume AIB will also have a reduction in provisioning.  Obviously, with quantitative easing happening, the direct cost from the ECB at only 3% is minimal in terms of leverage but wholesale funding is falling across the eurozone.  Therefore, if all of the drivers of cost bar one seem to have fallen significantly at the same time that the variable rate has increased significantly, is it reasonable to conclude that the sole driver of the increase in the variable rate is to drive shareholder funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#G01500","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1266,"content":"<p>I am not sure I follow the Deputy.

I have five quick questions which they might take together, if they will bear with me.  First, would the bank be open to third-party review of the applicable standard variable rate in circumstances where a consumer can demonstrate that this rate is inflicting hardship in their circumstances?  Would there be a role for an external agency to arbitrate in this matter as it applies to individual borrowers in much the same way as the Credit Review Office assists small and medium businesses with credit challenges?  This would be in an extreme case.  I salute what the bank has done but are there some cases where an independent, objective assessment would assist?<\/p> <p>  Second, on repossessions, I appreciate what the witness said about 50% re-engagement.  That is tremendous, but what is the bank's practice on voluntary assisted sales where the home owner surrenders the house and assists in the disposal process?  Does the bank write off the balance of the debt once the asset has been sold?<\/p> <p>  Third, has the bank done any analysis of the people in persistent arrears where they are failing to engage with the bank?  That would be a hard core case.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, what is the total amount of the current level of loans in arrears where the bank expects to repossess the property?<\/p> <p>  Fifth, has AIB sold any of its non-performing loans to debt investors or vulture funds, as they are often known?  What steps has the bank taken to ensure customers are protected on such a transfer?  Those are my questions, and I am grateful to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#J02000","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1308,"content":"<p>I will take them in the order-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#J02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1429707600,"counter":1309,"content":"<p>That is fine.

He asked if we would mind having an independent review in terms of someone's rate.  We have a pre-arrears protocol.  If someone has difficulty with their mortgage today, whether that is from a rate or whatever caused it, under the Central Bank protocols, we have a pre-arrears unit, they can identify their difficulty and we will run the affordability.<\/p> <p>  In terms of an independent assessment, the only independent assessment of affordability would be done through the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI.  I suppose that is the only one that could look at someone's case and apply reasonable expenses guidelines to it.  We do that.  We also add between 20% to 25% on top of that.  An independent assessment of affordability could be done.  The one that exists today by proxy is the ISI, but we have a level of reasonable living expenses in excess of that.  Would I personally mind if there was an independent check of affordability?  No.  I have seen it suggested, and I do not think it is a bad idea at all.<\/p> <p>  Regarding voluntary assisted sales, where someone has no affordability post the sale of the property, we do not go after people for the residual debt.  There is not much point.  However, we do look at residual debt on the basis of affordability, so to the extent that someone can afford to make some payment to the residual, within those reasonable living expense guidelines etc., we will seek it, and typically a payment for a period that is less than the insolvency period.<\/p> <p>  The last question was whether I could give the Senator an estimate of the value of the arrears in terms of properties we will repossess.  I am afraid I cannot because at this stage I cannot tell him the number of properties I believe will ultimately end up in repossession.  It will be significantly less than what was reported in the newspapers this morning, if we consider the levels of engagement that take place.  The bank has said that where someone cannot afford their mortgage we will not go after them for the residual debt if they sell the property.  In effect, that is the outcome we get if a house goes to possession.  It makes more sense for the individual, the borrower and the bank to do that consensually and achieve that outcome rather than go through a possession process.  However, I would like to find out how many are in this queue that we can restructure, and that is why we try to get the re-engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#J02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1429707600,"counter":1313,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#J02600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1429707600,"counter":1314,"content":"<p>I thank the gentlemen for their engagement.  On the mortgage repossessions issue, most reasonable observers would agree that to have a functioning mortgage market the bank must have entitlement to enforce or realise its security, but I am sure the witnesses would agree that there are many desperate cases that need special attention.  They will be aware that the Government will shortly announce initiatives in this regard to support those who are still in mortgage arrears and in negative equity.  Have the witnesses had any engagement with the Department of Finance on this?  Has it sought any advice or have officials spoken to the witnesses about it?  Are there any specific areas they would like Government to examine?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned that with regard to voluntary disposals, in most cases they look at the financial status of the borrower and will write off on the basis of what that shows up, and perhaps write off all the residual debt after the sale of the property.  Do they engage with borrowers before it comes to that in terms of arriving at what is affordable for them if that meets what the property might achieve on an open market sale, perhaps write down the mortgage at that stage, allow them stay in their home and retain ownership of the property without having to agree to voluntary disposal?  Is that something in which they engage?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fleming mentioned the bank's write-backs and write-downs.  Many of the losses generated in AIB and in the other banks were as a result of losses that crystallised when it had to sell some of its loans to NAMA, but there was significant provisioning as well.<\/p><p>Given the capital appreciation in property prices over recent years, I would have thought AIB would have significantly higher write-backs than &euro;150 million last year out of the total amount written down.  How does AIB arrive at a write-back?  Is that when a mortgage or property is finally sold and the price realised was higher than AIB expected?  Can AIB take a general view of its asset book and state that markets have improved significantly over recent years, the bank probably made too large a provision on its general loan books and take a figure there as opposed to realising individual write-backs when deals are settled?<\/p><p> In terms of AIB's engagement, I am sure other members received correspondence today from a lady in Waterford who is concerned about an agreement she had with the bank which was reneged upon in terms of legal action that is being taken against her.  She was distraught when I spoke to her this morning.  She asked me to raise that with AIB.  Although I do not want to get into the specifics, is Mr. O'Connor available to meet members on specific issues?<\/p><p> Following on Senator Hayden's point on receivership, the conduct of some receivers is an area about which I would be gravely concerned.  I wrote to the bank previously about one family in Galway which had fallen out with the bank and where receivers were appointed.  I refer to the figures in terms of what is being deducted from rents.  This is a buy-to-let situation and there were multiple properties.  Gross rents over a two-year period were close to &euro;400,000 but the amount credited back to their accounts was less than &euro;50,000.  Therefore, there were significant amounts being reduced.  They had made the case to the bank on several occasions that the return to the bank would be much stronger if they were allowed retain the management of the portfolio of assets.  I wrote to the bank about this.  I got a rather condescending response, not from the bank but from the bank's legal representatives, suggesting that I should have more interest in a return to the taxpayer than the borrower.  In this case, the proposals that were put to the bank would have resulted in a significantly better return for the bank and, ultimately, the taxpayer.  Is there an ability for us and these families to meet these bank representatives to engage?  Has the bank cases which have come out of receivership where the bank has allowed the individuals to manage the assets?  In the case I mention, there is no doubt it would result in a better return for the bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#J02700","speaker":"1185","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429707600,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>Most of Deputy Walsh's time is gone and I would ask for brief responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#K00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1317,"content":"<p>Typically, we appoint a receiver to properties because we are not getting paid any rent.

In terms of the interest rate that applied to variable mortgages, he said that operational costs were one of the factors.  How significant a portion of the overall decision-making process is represented by the bank's operational costs?  Does he regularly compare, with his peers across the eurozone, the bank's operational costs and analyse how they compare with others?  If so, how do they compare?  Is the bank at the point where there is no more latitude for its operational costs?   <\/p> <p>  My next few questions are perhaps more suited to Mr. O'Connor.  Earlier he described that most of the SMEs he engages with in Galway, that are in significant financial difficulty, diversified away from their core activity into property construction and management.  He said that he tries at all times to create a separation between those two entities so that the core business, if it is viable and sustainable on its own, continues to trade, survive and thus retains and protects the jobs already employed in that core business.  How distinct or distant is that separation?  Ultimately, one is talking about one or two individuals who are deeply involved in both activities.  Does the bank require, if the core business becomes substantially profitable, that some profits are diverted to the non-core business which is an asset that just sits there and is not worth a lot?  How does the mechanism work?  How is it determined which element of the core business's profits can be diverted towards the non-core construction activity?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#M00700","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1365,"content":"<p>I shall answer the first group of questions and Mr. O'Connor can respond to the second group.<\/p> <p>  On the cost issue, it is a material amount of all of our operating cost, risk cost, etc.  It has reduced by &euro;350 million in the past three years.

However, I acknowledge Mr. Duffy's office and AIB on the issue of cases that I brought to their attention.<\/p> <p>  I wish to give some credit to the comments made by Mr. O'Connor that AIB seems to take a more reasonable approach to people in mortgage arrears which I put down to the fact that it is 100% owned by the State.  Mr. Duffy has more or less acknowledged, in his statement, that because the bank's shareholder is the Government it is under more pressure to be a bit reasonable about these things in a way that some of the other banks that have come in here have not been.  I am sure they are very nice people too but that is not the point.  Certain other banks that have come in here have a very different attitude.  They do not give a damn what we or the Government thinks about priorities, dealing with distressed mortgage holders, rates and such like.  I welcome that fact.  <\/p> <p>  I am worried about influences on the bank.  Mr. Duffy said in his opening statement, in a number of different ways, that the other influences on the bank is \"the need to generate sustainable and viable returns for shareholders\" and, to use a particular phrase, \"to create an investable model so that over time the bank can start to return capital to the State\".  That is a euphemism for privatisation.  Am I correct?  We are talking about creating a model where the State disposes of its holdings in AIB which are sold off to private interests.  Is that the case?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#M01900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1377,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want to stretch that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#M02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1429707600,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>I would prefer if we had a banking system which was under more public pressure, in the way that I think AIB has been, to be a bit more reasonable with people in mortgage distress.

I can tell the Deputy that explicitly and that I would not take the job if that were the case.  Let us be clear about that upfront.<\/p> <p>  The principles which we operated were much more than those based on one's shareholder.  They are about the long-term viability of this bank and this country, which starts with two things.  A sustainable profitability because one has to be able to generate capital in order to repay the State and to lend.  The lending was our biggest obligation on one level.  <\/p> <p>  The second thing we have articulated from the outset is to treat customers fairly.  If one does not do so then all of the other issues we have talked about is nonsense.  The bank will not be sustainable because one's customers will remember.  What we have said from the outset is to keep people in their homes who have distressed mortgages, wherever possible, and protect jobs in the SME world, wherever possible.  That is a lot of what we have talked about today.  There is no shareholder direction that gives us the answer.  If we do not do those two things then two generations of people will have a very negative view of this bank.

I banked with AIB for many years and I am very familiar with its workings.  I will not go back over some of the points that were made.  Mr. Duffy might give me some answers in writing if he cannot answer all my questions now.<\/p> <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has not been mentioned.  What is the typical rate the bank will lend at through this vehicle?  What is the percentage cost of this?  Many SMEs would benefit from the vehicle.  I have been hearing rates of approximately 4.5% plus but I have a feeling that if the rate becomes too high, it will not be practical.  We need to ensure the product is as cheap as possible to get the SMEs back working.  We can review it in time.<\/p> <p>  A question raised with me and many others concerns how loyal customers believe the bank is imposing high interest rates on them by comparison with new businesses.  They feel aggrieved.  That is why a stir is being created.  The customers want their loyalty rewarded.  There must be some way of dealing with this.  Since this is becoming an issue, it needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Duffy said the average interest margin is 1.69%.  I do not like margins.  One of Mr. Duffy's Munster lenders, whom I will not name, stated one could have one's tail end in the fire and one's head in the fridge but one's average would not be too bad although the extremes would be poor.  I am sure Mr. Duffy heard that.  My point is that the percentage is masking a lot of items.  It is creating a fog that I cannot get around.  There is a myriad of factors in the background.<\/p> <p>  Some people are saying AIB is not engaging with the mortgage holders.  I heard about the whole list of forms.  The forms and numbers need to be in language that people can understand if there is a pre-arrears case.  I acknowledge that the bank does deal with this but the information needs to be communicated better.<\/p> <p>  I recently witnessed bank representatives in a courtroom seeking orders.  A particular bank, not AIB, wanted a committal order to be extended.  The judge threw out the case.  He was very frustrated because one either seeks a committal or not.<\/p> <p>  How many repossession cases will AIB deal with this year?  How many will proceed to full completion?  I would like to see more engagement to keep people in their homes until the bitter end.  I acknowledge that I heard Mr. Duffy refer to this many times.  I understand that we are dealing with a legacy issue.  There is a perception that there is not enough contact being made.  Many people are e-mailing me about this.<\/p> <p>  A bugbear of mine, another legacy issue, is Belfry.  I would like to be told that no more Belfry-type funds will ever be issued in any form and that people will not be given cheese and wine and asked to invest because they are valued customers.  What occurred was wrong and it will be wrong if it is ever done again.  Will AIB do anything for those customers who have had to bear a full 100% loss on their investment?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the restructuring of businesses, how much is new lending?  Mr. Duffy mentioned all the new lending.  Many of the restructurings involve new lending, by definition, but they are already in place.  There is nothing wrong with it but I wish to know the percentage.<\/p> <p>  With restructuring, there is a hidden cost.  I would like to see the bank bearing some of the burden of the restructuring debt.  There are all the costs that go with it and securities being perfected, etc., but the burden is landed on the customer.  It should be shared a little more equally.  Mr. Duffy will understand where I am coming from on that.<\/p> <p>  What are Mr. Duffy's views on the new Central Bank rulings regarding equity for mortgages?  Why has there been a 27% reduction in Central Bank and bank deposits, as mentioned in AIB's report?  There is a view that the banks, but not just AIB, are mopping up equity a little too diligently.  How does Mr. Duffy feel about that?  The figure for impaired loans, &euro;22 billion, is still huge.  How much of this will actually be realised?  What will it crystallise out to in the end?<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the bank has a mess to tidy up, and that it is doing so.  It has done a very good job in many respects.  It surely represents a cost on the bank.  Do the delegates know the cost at present?  The cost will obviously be reducing as the bank becomes a normal functioning bank.  Will the reduction be passed on to customers or will it go back to shareholders?  There are many issues to be addressed and we could do with a second meeting.  I would appreciate a written response if Mr. Duffy cannot answer my questions in detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#N00600","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1429707600,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>The Deputy's five minutes are up so I request that the answers be sent to the secretariat.

I received a communication from a constituent associated with an SME.  Obviously, SME lending is crucial to the future of the State.  The SME employs approximately 100 people so it is quite big by the standards of a rural constituency such as Clare.  It is a well-known and long-standing family business.  Through the most difficult years of the recession, the business kept all loans within contract, paying all on a full interest and capital basis without exception.  Approximately 20% of the loans were in a two-year review programme.  Owing to this, the business had a very good relationship with its local bank and decided that it would seek additional funding for capital investment.  It was not a huge amount.  It was less than 50% of what it was paying down every year.  The business was a bit surprised when its file was transferred to the Financial Solutions Group in Dublin.  The group is a section of the bank dedicated to supporting businesses and personal customers in financial difficulties.  A well-known accountancy firm was appointed to carry out an IBR to support the application but that firm also specialises in receiverships.  That was another slight concern but there were no difficulties with the bank whatsoever.  The bank then started examining the two-year review programme and effectively threatened the company, which was perfectly functioning, that it would appoint a receiver if it did not accept new loan terms and conditions.  This involved an increase of approximately 2% on the margin on the loans.  Of course, the term was also pushed out to make it stack up on paper.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, the SME sought legal and financial advice, which was that it made no sense to sign up to the arrangement.  However, it posed the question as to what alternatives existed?  When a bank appoints a receiver to a perfectly viable company, it cannot remain perfectly viable for much longer because the receivership will have a considerable impact on its reputation and credibility.  An SME employing 100 people might be a big fish in Clare but it is a tiny fish compared to AIB.  The bank will spend as much money as it takes; that is what banks do.  Does AIB prey on its successful SMEs to help fund those that are not successful?  Is there a deliberate policy of doing that in the bank?  We all know that successful mortgage holders, or those who are fortunate to be able to repay, are paying over the odds to pay for those who are not as fortunate and unable to repay and, of course, those who refuse to repay.  Does this apply to SMEs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015042200002#O01900","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429707600,"counter":1412,"content":"<p>We do not prey on SMEs in any way, shape or form.

His role as ambassador is supplemented by the fact that we now have a resident ambassador in Nairobi which means we have two resident ambassadors, both in Ireland and in Kenya.  That will foster closer relations.  There is huge potential between our two countries to grow that relationship which existed for many years through the missionaries, tourism and the many Irish people who have travelled to Kenya and the Irish companies working there.  I wish the ambassador well in his new role.  Coming from an economic and business background, he is well suited for the job to which he has been appointed.  It is a great honour for him to represent his country in Ireland.<\/p><p>At the outset I express my sympathy and that of all members of the committee to the ambassador and the people of Kenya on the recent terrorist massacre at Garissa University in northern Kenya.  We were all very saddened to see those horrific pictures on our television screens of that massacre when so many young people in the prime of life were taken out and killed.  They were attending university trying to do better for themselves.  Some would probably have gone on to pursue careers in academia, business or whatever.  It was very sad to see that atrocity happen in Kenya.<\/p><p>Ireland has had very strong links with Kenya in the past and I hope this meeting will build on those strong links.  We will also concentrate on bilateral relations between Ireland and Kenya.  Perhaps the ambassador will update us on the situation with al-Shabaab, in the whole region, with order in Kenya, with Somalia and all these areas.  <\/p><p>The format of the meeting is that there will be an opening statement from the ambassador, following which he will take questions from the joint committee.  Before we begin, I remind members and witnesses and those in the public gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment.  This is particularly important for this meeting because it is being streamed live on Oireachtas TV.<\/p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I am aware the ambassador has another engagement later so I call on him to make his opening statement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#A00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429693200,"counter":1446,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me to make a presentation to the honourable members of the committee on the current security situation in Kenya following the terrorist attack at the Garissa University College on 2 April 2015.  I further take this opportunity to thank the Irish Government and the people of Ireland for standing with Kenya in condemning the terrorists&rsquo; activities and for the messages of sympathy to the victims of the Garissa attack.  On behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya, I acknowledge our appreciation of the gesture of support demonstrated by His Excellency, the President of Ireland, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and other Government officials, all of whom came to sign the book of condolences as a sign of solidarity with the Government and the people of Kenya.<\/p> <p>  Following the attack, a total of 147 innocent lives were lost and many others with injuries were admitted to various hospitals.<\/p><p>Most of those admitted have since been treated and discharged.  The Government of Kenya will meet all the hospital and burial costs for all the victims.<\/p><p> The Government of Kenya, in consultation with college management and other stakeholders, has made the necessary arrangements for the relocation of students to other universities in Kenya.  This will ensure that their learning programmes will continue without interruption.<\/p><p> Despite the isolated terrorist attack in Garrisa on 2 April 2015, the security situation in the country is good.  The government has put in place necessary measures to ensure adequate security in all learning institutions and other areas that may be targeted by terrorists.  The Central Bank of Kenya has also frozen 86 accounts of individuals, organisations and financial institutions suspected to be facilitating terrorism and radicalisation in the country.<\/p><p> The government has also been working on various initiatives aimed at scaling up the level of public alertness and strengthening national security.  Some of the initiatives include: the enactment of the Security Laws Amendment Act 2014 that strengthened Kenyan legislation to deal firmly with terrorism and radicalisation; sustained ground, aerial and maritime surveillance along the Kenya-Somalia border; construction of perimeter fence and other complementing surveillance systems along the Kenya-Somalia border - construction of the initial 50 km stretch is underway from border point 1 to border point 29 in Kiunga; continuous collaboration with Muslim leaders to counter terrorism and extremists narratives; enhancement of implementation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2012 that provides the legal framework to fight terrorism; establishment of the financial reporting centre at the Central Bank of Kenya to analyse financial transactions and investigate the financing of terrorism; increased investment in the security sector, including fast-tracking of police reforms; application of technology in border controls, passenger profiling, and screening procedures of persons entering and leaving the country; establishment of partnership programmes with private establishments, such as hotels, learning institutions and shopping malls, to improve their physical security through awareness programmes and the exchange of threat and vulnerability assessments; enhancement of intelligence gathering and sharing through the community policing initiative Nyumba Kumi, which means ten household clusters; mounting multi-agency security operations under AU initiatives targeting various militia in Somalia; and co-operation and sharing of information with regional countries and other global liaison partners such as the UN, AU, IGAD and EAC.<\/p><p> Despite these counter-terrorism efforts, Kenya is faced with an emergent serious security challenge of radicalisation, which has created an indigenous group of terrorists who are now being used to plan and execute attacks within the country, as was noted in Garissa University on 2 April 2015.  The proponents of radicalisation have been able to recruit a considerable number of youths from the coast, north-east and Nairobi, as well as other parts of the country, mainly through exploiting the youths' desire for prosperity, financial inducements and promises of better living.<\/p><p> Kenya has been in the limelight, in particular, on matters of terrorism and violent extremism due to a number of reasons, including the 700 km porous common border it shares with southern Somalia, where the main al-Shabaab bases are located.<\/p><p> Some criminals have also managed to enter Kenya disguised as refugees only to convert the refugee camps as centres for radicalisation and planning of terrorist acts, as well as the indoctrination of Kenyan youths with the violent extremist ideologies through education institutions, mosques, the Internet, mass media and prison.  Others have been lured to cross into Somalia with the promise of employment opportunities, only to return having been indoctrinated into violent extremism. <\/p><p> Kenya will not relent in its fight against terrorism.  We are currently implementing the national counter-radicalisation strategy which has seven pillars covering media strategy, psychosocial strategy, faith-based strategy, capacity building strategy, political strategy, education strategy and security strategy. <\/p><p> All the national stakeholders have expressed their commitment to support the government's efforts in dealing with terrorism.  In this regard, civil society groups, faith-based organisations and development partners have also initiated strategies that complement government programmes on security.  To economically empower the youth and citizenry, the government is running programs under different funding schemes including the Uwezo fund, the youth enterprise fund and women enterprise fund.<\/p><p> Terrorism is an international security challenge that can be effectively dealt with through bilateral and multilateral co-operation.  In recognition of this fact, Kenya invites development partners for fruitful co-operation and especially in the thematic areas of: counter-terrorism prevention and intervention; countering violent extremism; police reforms and effectiveness; command and control CCTV; border security management; digitisation of immigration and registration services with digital records and biometrics; investigative, prosecutor and judicial capacity building; security inter-agency co-operation and collaboration; improvised explosive devices, IEDs, awareness, counter measures and disposal; and airport\/aviation security.<\/p><p> The other areas of co-operation that Kenya seeks to venture into include: strengthening inter-agency security co-operation; enhancing capacity for financial reporting to monitor mobile money transfers; capacity building programmes for anti-terrorism police, prosecution, immigration and judicial staff; acquisition of body scanners, scan-vans, intruder detection systems, vehicle-screening machines and night-vision equipment for aviation security; and the facilitation of benchmarking on best practice for counter-terrorism measures.<\/p><p> I wish to reiterate Kenya&rsquo;s commitment to fight against terrorism and further express a willingness to engage in fruitful partnerships aimed at dealing with the security challenges we currently face.  We look forward to initiating consultations with Ireland to identify areas of mutual interest for co-operation and these will be communicated to the Government through diplomatic channels.<\/p><p> Again, I sincerely thank the Chairman and other members of the committee for this opportunity to meet with them and for their positive engagement with Kenya.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#A00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Like the Chairman, I wish to put on the record the outrage of the Irish people, which was expressed by the Government and political leaders, concerning the recent appalling attack on an innocent university population in Kenya.  Ireland joined with the international community in condemning that outrage.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador's presentation clearly demonstrates the huge challenges facing Kenya as regards security issues.  He will be aware of the international commentary about the Kenyan Government's responses, including the negative comments on particular measures that the Kenyan Government has implemented.  These include the bombing of camps in southern Somalia and the decision to erect a fence along the entire Kenyan-Somali border.  In addition, there has been criticism of the lack of a strategy to reach out to and engage with communities in the fight against terrorism.<\/p> <p>  There has also been considerable comment on the need for the Kenyan Government and people to ensure there is no further alienation of the considerable Somali Muslim population in Kenya.  A strategy is required to deal with any possible further radicalisation of various communities.<\/p><p>The ambassador might take an opportunity to elaborate on how he sees the actions and the measures taken by his government and how it will deal with those obvious issues.  <\/p><p> One other issue of importance is the work of civil society organisations in Kenya.  The ambassador will be aware more than any of us of the considerable contribution made by international organisations.  Some of our non-governmental organisations have sister organisations working in Kenya and there is some concern in regard to the implementation of the Public Benefits Organisation Act.  I think the organisations working there are anxious that there would not be an unrealistic cap put on the level of expenditure and programme activity that they can involve themselves in because Kenya is the headquarters of many non-governmental organisations for their work in Somalia and South Sudan.  As we all know, civil society organisations play a very important role, particularly in countries where there is major conflict, terrorism or where there have been humanitarian issues and disasters.  I would like to get an assurance from the ambassador that the implementation of the Public Benefits Organisation Act will not hinder the very good work undertaken by those organisations.  Part of the purpose of the implementation of this Act is greater accountability and transparency.  That is an issue we all agree with but that should not be a method of closing down some of the valuable and very important work of those organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#B00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1451,"content":"<p>I also want to sympathise and empathise with the ambassador on the recent tragic events and, as we have all tried to do, to identify the causes, as we see them, perhaps from a distance.  Unfortunately, international terrorism, which has now become a matter of fact, is wreaking havoc on many innocent people across the globe and Africa is no exception.  I wonder whether the time has come for a much more co-ordinated approach, not necessarily leaving the burden of responsibility to any one country because I do not think any one country is capable of dealing with the situation.  As long as international terrorists have safe havens to go to, they will continue to do what they have done to an even greater extent, simply because they have access to unlimited funds, unlimited arms and organisational ability, which, sadly, will be used to destroy innocent lives and wreak havoc on the economies of the countries they target.  Unfortunately, damage can be done internationally to the reputation of countries that become the victims of mindless acts of terrorism because investors do not wish to be associated with places like that.  <\/p> <p>  If the African Union can be utilised to confront this particular threat, that should be done at an early date.

Following the tragic death of a young Irish woman recently, who was at university abroad, we know the effects of her death on her family and on our population.  Were the 147 all Kenyan or did they come from other countries also?  I chair the Irish section of AWEPA, so we have had a lot of engagement with parliamentarians from Africa.  We had a conference some months ago which was about internal migration within Africa and I do not think there is enough emphasis on the extent of internal migration which is affecting every African country.  We see what is happening in South Africa at the moment and the tensions there with migrant groups.  Looking at Kenya, it comes down to how to engage with the migrant groups coming into Kenya so that they feel part of society and they are not alienated.  <\/p> <p>  I have a question on young people - we know there are massive issues around youth unemployment in Europe, but particularly in Africa - and how those disaffected youth can be engaged in positive ways through education, training and employment, because they are the target for radicalism.  How active a role are religious leaders playing with these youth so that they engage in positive activities rather than negative ones?  What effect will closing the Dadaab refugee camp have on people who are there?<\/p> <p>  The last question is on the funding of al-Shabaab.  It is getting money because it could not run those operations without significant funding.  Is the ambassador confident that some of the measures he has outlined will close off channels of funding to these groups?<\/p> <p>  There are concerns that this tragedy could have been prevented if security forces had moved more quickly, and we have had similar situations in this country where tragedies might have been prevented.  While it will not bring back the 147 people who lost their lives, there are lessons for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#C00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1453,"content":"<p>Will the ambassador respond to those three sets of questions?

There has definitely been international outrage about what transpired in Kenya and certain comments have been made.  Based on this, the position Kenya has taken is quite clear.  We need to remember Kenya has ensured that certain activities being perpetrated by these terrorist concerns and groups are being addressed.  I refer the committee to the piracy that was ongoing on the Suez Canal, which caused international outcry on the trading route.  Kenya took measures to ensure that was quelled.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the Public Benefit Organisation Act.  Kenya has put its case forward and stated clearly that non-governmental actors in Kenya making valid contributions towards assistance on the humanitarian level are most welcome.  We have an NGO society that comprises in excess of 4,000 organisations engaged in various activities to assist on a humanitarian level.  The funding of these concerns must be accounted for and they must be accountable because these resources are obtained from donors in other countries who give willingly in the hope that a project specified for that utilisation will be executed.  Unfortunately, the records of these public benefit organisations are not well kept.  The government has stated clearly that if an organisation is involved in a humanitarian engagement, it really does not have anything to hide.  All we want to know is: is the organisation registered?  Is it complying with its mandate as a charitable concern?  Is it accounting for the moneys that it is receiving from those people who are supporting it?  Is it ensuring that it is going to the beneficiaries and is this money being used in a sustainable manner?  Some of these concerns utilise this money to enrich themselves.<\/p><p> The amount of money that is used for administrative costs and requirements far exceeds what goes to the beneficiaries of that charity or contribution.  Looking at what actions we are taking and taking into context the civil society, the Kenyan Government is not in any way cancelling negotiations or discussions with the civil organisations.  We are willing to discuss with them and we are willing to listen to them but we are also stating clearly that we have a challenge and it is a two-way traffic.  The Kenyan Government has engaged with Ireland and the humanitarian and non-governmental concerns of Ireland to find ways and means in which we can work together.  We are, as I mentioned in my presentation, working on the Nyumba Kumi initiative, which involves public policing.  At this moment in time, some of our officers are undertaking a course in Templemore on that aspect.  We are very appreciative of what Ireland is doing for Kenya in that regard.  <\/p><p> I understand he has left the meeting, but Deputy Durkan raised valid concerns.  We are moving towards ensuring that we have a co-ordinated approach.  We are looking at it being done with consideration for the communities and nations within the area.  There is the East Africa community area and the larger neighbouring states in that area.  However, when we are looking at the al-Shabaab, what is the objective?  It is to initiate sustained attacks in any way it can that affect the economy of our nation.  This has been realised.  It is now a known and challenging fact that our tourism sector is suffering because of these attacks.<\/p><p> The travel advisories are also affecting the nation.  Once these attacks are perpetrated, we find that the hoteliers and the tourism attractions, which are mainly in the coastal region, suffer from a depletion.  The international tourism community does not want to come to Kenya because of the red alerts, travel advisories, negative publicity and all manner of non-support.  This does not allow Kenya to move forward.  We have a big problem in that area and we would appreciate if the international community would evaluate the economic damage that some of these travel advisories are having on Kenya.<\/p><p> If we look at the coastal area of Kenya, where we have a huge Muslim population, the number of people who have lost their jobs in the hotel industry and the value-add industry spinning off from the tourism industry exceeds 25,000.  These people cannot now find a reasonable and decent form of livelihood.  They have experience in the hospitality industry, but are now being easily radicalised.  They are being made part and parcel of a terrorism concern, organisation, unit, or club, or for that matter, society.  This is a big problem, but we have the African Union, known as AMISOM, and which includes Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and Somalia.  These countries are making their contribution towards stabilisation programmes for Somalia.  <\/p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan asked whether the 147 people referred to were Kenyans or of other nationalities.  Garissa University was a newly opened university and its enrolment was purely Kenyan students coming from various regions within the republic.  Many came from the western part of the republic.  Others came from the central and coastal part, inclusive of the north eastern part, which is basically within the Garissa area.  When we look at internal immigration, Kenya has been a country which has been very accommodative.  We have had to shoulder many of the immigrants or refugees coming in from Somalia as a result of the destabilisation of the Government structures there.  From South Sudan, we have two of the largest camps in the world.  The Kakuma camp is in the western part of the country on the border with Sudan.  We also have the Dadaab camp, which houses more than 600,000 refugees.  This camp has exerted a lot of pressure on the economy of Kenya and contributed greatly to the environmental degradation of that area.  <\/p><p> Since 1991, we have been continually cognisant of the problem in Somalia.  This camp has been open for the past 24 years and, in conjunction with various humanitarian organisations, NGOs, the United Nations humanitarian effort and the United Nations commission for refugees, we have been associating in ways and means to ensure that at least some form of assistance is given to these refugees, that they have sanitation, water and a way to get an education and that they can create a livelihood within these camps.  The strain has been excessive and we are now looking at ways and means to come up with a tripartite agreement, between Kenya, Somalia, and the United Nations, to find ways and means within which we can either close the camp so that these refugees can be moved back to their country and from there be incorporated into the well-being, development and economic good of their own country.<\/p><p> The camps, for reasons best known to the terrorists, have been infiltrated by the al-Shabaab.  It is now using these camps and the individuals within these camps, more particularly, the youth, to radicalise them.  In certain instances, religious leaders from Somalia have infiltrated these camps and are perpetrating the acts of organising attacks on Kenyans in the coastal region.  The committee will note that there was a time when these attacks were mainly in the city of Nairobi.  There were bombs and improvised explosive devices in Nairobi.  The security measures which have been taken have now made it not possible for these strikes to be perpetrated within the cities.  Now they are further in towards the border between Kenya and Somalia.<\/p><p> Many efforts are also being made towards ensuring that the Kenyan Government, acting with the religious leaders and through the various means of information and engagement, is making the people there aware that the Government is working towards their betterment.  We are not working towards their detriment.  We have never done so and we do not intend do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I understand he took up his post in January 2015.   We were all horrified by some of the attacks mentioned here this morning, including the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and the Garissa University attacks.  There were also some 140 or 150 other attacks by al-Shabaab in the country since it joined AMISOM.  There was outrage, anger and frustration.  Some of that anger and frustration concerned the poor security response to the attacks.<\/p><p>We were told the security forces were slow to react to the attack at Garissa University.  There were reports the journalists reached the university before the elite army and police squads.  A high ranking police official has been accused of using a police plane for a personal errand to fly his daughter and daughter-in-law from Mombasa to Nairobi, which caused the commandos to respond 12 hours after the al-Shabaab attack.  I have read that nine security officials have been suspended, pending an investigation.  When is the investigation expected to conclude and will it be made public? <\/p><p> The ambassador mentioned there were 600,000 refugees in the Dadaab refugee camps.  Other figures put it at 350,00 Somali refugees.  The Kenyan Government is looking at ways and means to close the camp.  A target of three months has been set to close the camp because of environmental problem and that it is being used for recruitment to terrorist organisations.  How does one move that number of people and where is it proposed that they will go? <\/p><p> UNHCR has described the plan as abrupt and warned that it will have extreme practical humanitarian consequences.  Surely sending the refugees back to Somalia puts them at risk of human rights abuses, rape, killing as well as extortion and so on, many of the abuses from which they were fleeing originally?  The UN has said that if the refugees were forced to return it would be in breach of international law and it would not facilitate such a move.  I believe that Kenya is a signatory to the UNHCR 1951 Refugee Convention which prohibits forcing refugees back to areas where their life or freedom is threatened.  How does Mr. Richard Opembe square that circle?  Many have been in the camp for years.  They have fled from ongoing conflicts and famine.  Will forcing the refugees to return to their homeland not be seen as a victory for al-Shabaab?<\/p><p> Kenya made international headlines when it passed the Marriage Act in 2014 which legalised polygamy.  During the debate on the controversial Bill, female MPs stormed out angrily from the late night parliamentary session.  The Bill initially allowed the first wife the right to veto the husband's choice of additional spouses but again male MPs successfully pushed to get that clause dropped.  Will he comment on why the Bill was brought forward?  Would he not agree that women in polygamous unions face additional barriers to realising their rights to equality, including standards of living, housing and health?<\/p><p> What is happening in Kenya?  I was in Tanzania recently and one does not have the same problems there or in many societies that are more inclusive.  It is not only that al-Shabaab invaded the country, but there is a problem in Kenya itself.  That terrorist group is recruiting young people in Kenya at present.  Some of those involved in the last attack were Kenyan citizens.  Is part of the problem not just a security response but does the government need to build a new and a more inclusive society? <\/p><p> The Public Benefits Organisations Act 2013, specifically caps the foreign funding for NGOs at 15% of their total budgets.  Again my understanding of what the NGOs have been doing is trying to help build civic society.  If this cap is introduced, one will see thousands unemployed and this will impact on civic society building, which is of major importance for any society.  Rather than dealing with the current problems the direction the Kenyan Government is taking will isolate and alienate Kenya even more.  In regard to the movement of Somalis and the movement against the Muslim population, surely that will exacerbate the problem within Kenyan society and not only make conditions worse but further threaten Kenyan society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#D00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1458,"content":"<p>I welcome the new ambassador, His Excellency, Mr. Richard Opembe.  Having read his contribution and listened to his presentation, I wish him every success in his new position.  I wish his country every success in rolling back the horrors of what is happening to Kenya.  I lived in Africa for four years and I am still trying to come to terms with the complexities of the Continent of Africa and its individual countries, such as Kenya.  I would be very familiar from travelling with the area around Mombasa up along the coast to Malindi and having a most wonderful time on Lamu Island and in Garissa before there was a university in that area.  I am reasonably familiar with the terrain.<\/p> <p>  We in the west are finding it very difficult to come to terms with the activity of Boko Haram in Nigeria and al-Shabaab in Kenya and Somalia.  We want to extend our sympathy to the former Kenyan ambassador to Ireland whose son was slaughtered in the Westgate Mall atrocity.  What I am trying to understand is ethnicity and the cultural issues that are at play in Kenya, in particular the religious conflicts that seem to be extending across Africa but I will concentre on Kenya.<\/p> <p>  We know that Mombasa is multicultural with phenomenal diversity, however, how does one explain the hatred for \"western education\"?  How does one explain that terrorists would isolate Christians or other non-ethnic groups and assassinate them brutally?  Broadly speaking, Kenya is an educated nation.  What forces are at play that are trying to undermine the educational development in Africa?  it is clear that the terrorists attack the fundamentals of tourism.  Africa relies very largely on foreign direct investment through tourism.  The ambassador has mentioned it.  As he knows, Kenya is a beautiful country and very attractive to tourists.  Does he think there is a deliberate ploy to undermine the economy of African countries, including Kenya, by targeting their ability to attract inward investment?<\/p> <p>  We hear about the cultural corruption of so many countries, but particularly when it comes to politics and ethnicity.  Is corruption part and parcel of the way of life of those in power in politics in Kenya?  If that is a fact, does he agree that it undermines the very fabric of society?  Does the ambassador agree that the ability to reform society in Kenya is more difficult if people like al-Shabaab can say that those in power are a corrupt shower of buggers, that corruption is widespread?  Can he explain the horrors of the young terrorist who was the very well educated young son of a prominent Kenyan, while we are being led to believe that the terrorists are ignorant and are influenced by the Mullahs or by the religious leaders in the Muslim faith?<\/p><p>Is it the case that Christians are availing more of the educational services that are available and, therefore, are more economically powerful, which is leading to resentment on the part of ethnic groups and their tribal leaders who are not benefiting to the same extent?  In the ambassador's view, does the Muslim community avail of Western educational services to the same extent as the Christian community does, or is there a in-built conflict there?<\/p><p> The ambassador indicated that his country wants to move the refugees in the Dadaab camp back to Somalia.  Would this not be a mistake solely on the basis of logistics?  If the refugees are on Kenyan soil, the authorities there have reasons to police and manage them.  If these people are sent back to Somalia, that ability to monitor, for intelligence purposes and so on, is lost.  If the Kenyan Government does send the refugees back to Somalia - the ambassador says there are 600,000 of them; other sources say there are 350,000 - it will surely have lost an important intelligence ability.<\/p><p> Sometimes, because I know Africa so well, I feel guilty about talking about it from this room in Ireland.  It might be because of Kenya's participation in the African Union that it is now a victim of terrorism from Somalia, which resents the forces who are aligned under that union.  I wish the ambassador well and all those on the African continent who are fighting terrorism.  We are anxious to get a handle on the forces at play which are undermining his country and its economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#E00200","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1460,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador and wish him well on his appointment.  We have all followed with alarm what is happening right across parts of Africa, including Kenya, and the Middle East.  Every right-thinking person is revolted to see young students with their lives ahead of them and all their ambitions to be realised being slaughtered in the manner in which they were in Kenya.  The victims were separated because they were Christians and killed as such.  That is a common feature of many of these types of atrocities.<\/p><p>I note some of the measures the Kenyan Government is putting in place to tackle terrorism mirror actions we took in this country.  However, I wonder, given the internationally embedded nature of terrorism right across the regions concerned, whether Kenya alone, or any single country, can deal with it.  The ambassador described plans to sequester and freeze bank accounts, which is something that was done effectively in Ireland with the introduction of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I saw a report recently in <i>The New York Times<\/i>which indicated that Daesh has an annual income in the order of $2 billion per year.  Anything the Kenyan Government does will merely scratch the surface of that.  There appears to be at least some links, however tenuous, between many of these groups.  Boko Haram was mentioned, as well as al-Shabaab and Daesh.  All of these groups are interconnected to a degree and are all comprised of radicalised individuals.<\/p><p>Will the ambassador comment on the assistance, or lack of same, Kenya is receiving?  We have heard a lot of soundbites coming from Western governments, including our own Government, the European Union, the United States and so on.  However, some of the countries making these pronouncements were actually instrumental in the rise of this radicalism when they moved into situations where they perceived a threat.  Now, when there is a real threat, they seem to be standing back and, like spectators on the sideline, commenting but doing nothing.  That is a disgrace in a context where young, innocent people are in grave danger and, such as in the case of the Christians from Ethiopia who fled through Libya, being slaughtered by terrorists.<\/p><p>The United Nations is very good at trying to impose a certain radical feminist agenda on African countries, which is alien to their culture.  I do not see that organisation being as strongly focused on these real issues, where the loss of innocent lives is happening.  Will the ambassador comment on that?<\/p><p>I note that the co-chairs of the UN committee which is dealing with the new sustainable development goals are the Irish ambassador and the Kenyan ambassador to the UN.  We welcome this close engagement with Kenya on the issue.<\/p><p>This meeting is not necessarily an occasion for putting Kenya or its policies under the microscope.  The ambassador's country, like our own, has deficiencies in the manner of its administration and its policies.  However, the fundamental problems we are discussing today are of such a monumental scale that our focus should be exclusively on them to see how they can be eradicated.  The ambassador referred to radicals moving into refugee camps.  It is easy to radicalise people who are very poor.  What types of law and order structures are in operation within the camps?  Do they come under the remit of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR?  Some of us have visited such camps, including the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, which was home to 120,000 refugees when we were there.  I understood that number subsequently increased to at least 150,000.  There were no police at the camp.  The people running it were aware that Christians had to pretend they were Muslim to avoid being killed.  Women were being raped and forced into prostitution.  Howe well managed and policed are the camps in Kenya?  What would the ambassador like to see the international community doing to assist as distinct from what it is saying about the situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#F00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>I invite the ambassador to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#F00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429693200,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.  I will begin with Deputy Crowe's questions.  We have a very good programme in Kenya to ensure, first and foremost, that we act in the interest of the nation and its people and the international community.  Since 1991, when this problem emerged in Somalia, the international community has ably supported these camps and contributed extensively to them.  It has made every possible human contribution to keep these refugees from Somalia alive and ensure they are able to continue living in some form of dignity within the borders of Kenya, including at the Dadaab camp.  The United Nations has played an exceptional role in keeping the camps habitable by providing for sanitation requirements and medical education and ensuring the individuals who are accommodated there are part and parcel of the internal community of Kenya.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the security situation, with particular reference to the Garissa attack.<\/p><p>An attack is an attack and the response to an attack is subject to the conditions that prevail in that attack.  Garissa is 360 km away from Nairobi.  Questions have arisen regarding the decision to have the internal security Minister and the local police chief in place in Garissa before a direct unit went in.  Does one set up a command centre first or an attack programme?  Members will recall the Westgate tragedy where there was a co-ordination slip that resulted in both the military and the police being in the same place seeking out the same objective.  We did not intend to make that mistake again.  That is why the decision was taken to set up a command centre first to ensure that any action thereafter was well co-ordinated and executed within the shortest possible timeframe.  Westgate took four days; Garissa took 15 hours.  <\/p><p> I will turn now to another issue of concern, namely the allegations that police officers made personal use of helicopters.  I will not comment on this until the investigations are concluded.  I am sure that a proper report will be submitted on that issue and will indicate what actually transpired.  <\/p><p> Will al-Shabaab become a victor?  Al-Shabaab will never be victorious in anything because whatever it does cannot signify any victory in any way whatsoever.  It is not a victory when the sanctity of life is destroyed.  Al-Shabaab does not merit any recognition by international governments or the Kenyan Government.  It is a grouping of people who are perpetrating heinous acts that cannot be allowed to continue.  The Kenyan Government will ensure that each and every element of al-Shabaab is dealt with.  <\/p><p> In terms of Kenyan society and the place of religion, we do not and have never segregated along religious lines.  We have never considered sending Somalis back to Somalia.  In historical terms, there are Kenyan Somalis.  We have a border with Somalia.  We have shared interests with Somalia for many years and we continue to trade with Somalia..  No statement has been made by any Kenyan to the effect that we consider Somalis in Kenya as anything other than Kenyan citizens and our brothers and sisters.<\/p><p> The marriage Bill is still a Bill; it is not yet an Act and it is not enshrined in our constitution.  The constitution of Kenya gives citizens their human rights and the freedom to engage fully, freely and without any inhibition.  The Government of his Excellency, President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta, has made gender parity one of the pillars of its manifesto.  I made reference earlier to the Uwezo Fund and the Women Enterprise Fund.  The Government of Kenya ensures that 30% of contracts are awarded to women and women's groups in order to build them up economically and to ensure that they are part and parcel of Kenyan society and equal citizens within the country.<\/p><p> Regarding NGOs and the loss of jobs, employment sustains people and provides them with an income.  NGOs working within Kenya must be registered to be recognised and those employed by NGOs must benefit from the work they do.  It is a requirement that they be registered and if they have nothing to hide then they must meet that requirement.  If they fail to meet that requirement and continue with their work in the country, they are not in compliance with the regulations as set down.  If all of the 4,000 NGOs are doing the job they came to Kenya to do, then all 4,000 should be registered and all those who have been employed by those NGOs should continue with their work.  However, if they do not comply with the requirements set out then it will be difficult for them to continue functioning.  <\/p><p> In response to Deputy Byrne, freedom of religion in Kenya is a constitutional right.  The right to worship, freedom to worship, freedom of association and freedom of expression are all enshrined in our constitution.  Al-Shabaab has been viewed as a Somali outfit, a terrorist organisation and a religious concern but it is none of those things.  It is merely a grouping of criminals who do not respect the sanctity of life.  Its members are criminals who shall be dealt with on a criminal basis.  When they engage they separate Muslims from Christians and kill Christians in the name of a religious pursuit but they have never expressed what that pursuit is.  They have never indicated who they are targeting or what their aims and objectives are.  What do they want to realise?  Al-Shabaab does not have one iota of respect for human life.  The acts perpetrated by al-Shabaab in Kenya include the killing of 11 minors, 28 teachers and 147 university students in the north-eastern region as well as the detonation of explosives in several cities which have maimed many Kenyans.<\/p><p>They have contributed towards the economic decline of the tourism sector in Kenya, but their objective is unknown.  We cannot pretend we want to engage with a group of criminals or that we can sit at a table and agree that their religious pursuit and attempts at radicalisation are something we can discuss.  We cannot discuss any of these things with these criminals.  They are not people who are worth our attention but they are people whom we shall pursue to ensure that safety is brought back to our country and that they will no longer be able to engage in these terrorist acts in Kenya.<\/p><p> I was asked whether education was being used as a weapon by al-Shabaab to bring about tension between those who are educated and those who are not educated.  That has not been the position.  Members who have already been to Kenya will know that the intention of al-Shabaab to create religious animosity has not worked and never will work.  We have Somalis of Kenyan extraction in Nairobi and throughout Kenya, but never has a Kenyan, whether Somali, Bantu or Nilotic, or from western, eastern or southern Kenya, lifted an arm to attack a Muslim because of the al-Shabaab attacks.  Religious radicalisation is not aimed at Muslims or Christians.  Their target and objectives are unknown, so the people of Kenya simply look at the members of al-Shabaab as what they are - criminals who represent no religious cause.<\/p><p> The educated young lawyer who was involved reminds me of Osama bin Laden, who was also very well educated and very wealthy but was responsible for the setting up of al-Qaeda.  We do not consider that education is part and parcel of the reason al-Shabaab is engaging in these activities.  Education has never been an issue, nor has religion been propagated by al-Shabaab.<\/p><p> On the subject of the camp, I was asked how long was too long.  How long is too short?  From 1991 to date is 24 years and the Kenyan Government is now re-evaluating the whole Dadaab camp and looking at ways to ensure that the inhabitants of the camps are given safe passage back to their country to make a contribution to the economic growth of their country.  AMISOM is there and there is a Somali national Government.  There is a functioning economy.  It may not be as good as we would like, but considering the situation it has been in for 24 years, that is perhaps to be expected.  There must be a way, and we are working with the EU and the United Nations to that end.  A ministerial briefing states that Kenya, Somalia and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees are to sit under a tripartite agreement to look at the modalities within which these refugees can be repatriated to their country in the most humane manner possible.  We must take full cognisance of the fact that this is a humongous task, but some have willingly returned and there are those who continue to yearn to return.  They must be facilitated and a programme must begin to bring this about.<\/p><p> Senator Walsh asked me a question.  It is Kenyans who have died, whether they were students, miners, teachers or day-to-day workers.  Three hundred and eighty-four have passed on, many have been maimed and many others psychologically injured by these acts.  I appreciate the sentiments, but when do we start looking at the situation realistically and holistically?  How can we help bring about a semblance of normality in Somalia?  Do we continuously listen to the soundbites emanating from certain quarters?  We are taking steps.<\/p><p> Someone mentioned the Daesh and the amount of money it has.  In my presentation I indicated that the Kenyan Government has monitored and closed 86 foreign exchange concerns, because that is probably where some of their money comes from.  This money is what propels terrorist activities.  <\/p><p> The travel advisories concerning Kenya have had an adverse effect on the economy, and one must ask the question of whether the travel advisories would be better placed on Somalia than Kenya.  We are the victim and, by virtue of that, we seek the international community's understanding that these advisories are having a damaging effect on our economy.  We should not be in this position, and Kenya's role in trying to quell the conflict and bring a semblance of peace to Somalia should be commended.  Nobody is talking about piracy any more, yet a couple of years back it was given huge attention.  Nobody is addressing that now because the Kenyan defence forces did their job and got the situation under control, so that piracy is now negligible.<\/p><p> I have already said we are taking steps to deal with the refugee camp of Dadaab with the tripartite group involving Kenya, Somalia and the UNHCR.  I was asked what I and the Kenyan Government want to be done.  In my statement I said we looked forward to initiating consultations with the international community on the best ways to ensure that this act of al-Shabaab is dealt with and the security situation in Africa is improved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The European Parliament passed a non-binding motion on the issue.  I realise it is a sensitive issue for the people of Turkey but we must remember that one of the first people to acknowledge it as genocide was Turkey's great leader, Kemal Ataturk, who acknowledged in the 1920s that what happened was not just a tragedy, as has been said by others, but genocide.  As the Pope said, it was the first genocide of the 20th century.  Unfortunately, it was the not last.<\/p> <p>  I ask colleagues to support this motion.  I note that other countries have not had the courage of their convictions, have been lobbied and have said that it is sensitive.  It is 100 years later.  A wrong was done.

We have just passed the centenary of that awful atrocity.  <i>The New York Times<\/i>recently noted that Armenians say that up to 1.5 million Armenian Christians were systematically slaughtered in eastern Turkey through mass killings, forced relocations and starvation.  Many historians and legal scholars have called the Armenian killings genocide, including Raphael Lemkin, the Polish Jewish jurist who came up with the term in 1944.  The Armenians have lobbied extensively for this to be accepted.  I know that the genocide will be observed by Armenians worldwide.<\/p><p>It is interesting that the European Parliament has passed a motion referring to it as genocide and calling on Turkey to acknowledge this very fact.  Speaking in the European Parliament, Elmar Brok, a German MEP, underlined what he called the moral obligation to recognise and commemorate such massacres.  He said &quot;my own people committed genocides&quot; and that &quot;hundreds of thousands of Armenians died at the hands of the Ottoman empire's henchmen&quot;.  It is particularly appropriate not just because it is the centenary but also because of what is happening.  We just had a discussion here with the Kenyan ambassador about the genocide taking place across the Middle East.  We should send a strong signal that genocide is unacceptable.  In recognising this, we are putting it up to Turkey to also recognise it.  If countries fail or are in denial about this, it is unacceptable and does not nothing to counter extremist, radical thinking which a lot of this emanates from.  I am happy to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#J01400","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1483,"content":"<p>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, had a question down for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday.<\/p><p>The reply from the Minister stated: \"The Irish government has never taken a position on this issue, believing that it is not in a position to adjudicate on this contentious matter, involving the consideration of a number of legal issues and an assessment of the actions and intentions of many parties during that time.\"  That is an appalling position to adopt.  It is denying history and does not help in any way to get an understanding of what happened in Armenia.  It is a pathetic answer given that the UN has agreed that what happened meets the criteria of a genocide.  As my colleague has said, the European Parliament has passed five motions recognising it as a genocide.  A total of 24 countries have officially recognised it as a genocide, including 12 EU countries.<\/p><p> If we do not accept what happened in the past then we cannot learn from the mistakes and move on.  Again, Ireland has no problem in recognising the Holocaust as a genocide, the Rwandan genocide or the genocide in Darfur, and rightly so.  The question is, why not in Armenia?  It is not as if it happened 500 or 1,000 years ago.  It happened 100 years ago.  There is accurate oral and written accounts of what actually happened.  Anyone who reads the evidence at length cannot deny that genocide happened.<\/p><p> Throughout the world victims of genocide ask first for recognition of the crime committed against them.  That is usually the process.  It is essential as part of the healing process that we discuss it.  We need to support them in this recognition.  There will be no further trials.  The killers got away with the mass murder.  It happened 100 years ago.  However, I believe it is one of those open wounds that needs to be healed.  There needs to be recognition between Armenia and Turkey in respect of what happened.  In itself, that would bring those two countries and the whole region closer together.

We have seen so many people die trying to make a better life for themselves in Europe as a result of conflict in their countries of origin.  We have seen an incredible smuggling industry develop out of the conflicts in many of the African countries concerned.  It is built on human misery.  It took the deaths of 700 or 800 people over the weekend for the European Union to realise the serious problem it has on its shores.  It is sad, because we should have dealt with this much sooner.<\/p> <p>  When I was in Morocco in January representing the committee, that country's Prime Minister said that Europe should wake up to this problem.  Perhaps some members of the European Union turned a blind eye to this.  While we know of a large number of people who have drowned, we must suppose there are others who drowned having taken smaller boats and about whom nobody knows anything.<\/p> <p>  As a result of what happened on Monday, Mr. Donald Tusk has called a meeting for Thursday.  The Taoiseach will represent the Government at it.  This issue was raised yesterday in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Gerry Adams during Leaders' Questions, and I am delighted he did so.  The Taoiseach dealt with the matter in a very comprehensive and sympathetic way.  As members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, we need to deal with it also, and that is why I put it on the agenda today.<\/p><p>The foreign affairs Ministers met on Monday last and proposed a ten-point plan to deal with the situation.  While it is a challenging and difficult situation and not a straightforward one, at least it  is very much at the top of the agenda.  People's lives are at stake.  People are making money out of human misery. The people on that boat were not only Africans.  Some of them were from Bangladesh and other regions.  Europe and Africa need to deal with the core of the problem and not only the refugees that come across to Europe to try to make a better live for themselves.  There is not a better life for them in Europe but they are trying to escape from atrocities, human misery and conflict in their own countries.<\/p><p> The discussion of this issue is important for us as a committee in considering where we go from here with this issue.  It would rightly deserve a full meeting but because of its urgency I brought it forward today.  I open the floor for discussion on this matter and I call Deputy Brendan Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#M01900","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1554,"content":"<p>I am glad the Chairman put this item on the agenda.  We have been aware for quite some time of the huge tragedy that has been unfolding before us but, unfortunately, no effective action has been taken.  We only learn of the massive loss of life when we hear of the loss of large numbers of people on large vessels.  Those people are being trafficked and abused.  We do not have the words to describe adequately their misery and suffering.  We now realise the appalling conditions those people live in when they take to those boats and risk travelling to Europe.  A clear message needs to go out that such human trafficking and unbelievable abuse of fellow human beings need to be tackled at source.  I do not know how the European Union can get to those countries where those criminals are involved in trafficking people the message as to how they need to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Malta, which is a very small state, and Italy, which is a much larger state, have been seeking help for years to deal with the issue of the huge numbers of migrants landing on their shores.  Other member states of the European Union have not been supportive of those countries.  I do not know the answer to this migration crisis but it is unacceptable that we are witnessing the slaughter and degradation of human beings on such a large scale.  As the Chairman said, we probably do not have any idea of the actual loss of human life in these circumstances.  What we are witnessing is incredible in this day and age.  The European Union must respond in a meaningful way and we, as a member state, must also respond proportionately.  We have a good record down the years in assisting in humanitarian crises, both through our people's voluntary contributions and through our taxpayers' contribution.  It is in our psyche, stemming back in our history to more than 150 years ago, to have empathy, sympathy and genuine concern for people who are being treated in such an appalling way.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Heads of Government are due to meet this week and that the foreign Ministers and interior and justice Ministers have met.  Obviously, programmes need to be put in place.  An Irish person who has spoken out loudly and credibly on this issue at European level for a number of year is the former Attorney General, Peter Sutherland.  He has been championing the cause of those people who have been caught in such circumstances.  We are a very small cog in the wheel in terms of trying to influence and put in place an adequate response, but surely the Presidency of the European Union should convene a meeting of the chairmen of the foreign affairs committees of every member state parliament to create extra awareness of this issue.  We are doing it now at committee level and it is being done at D&aacute;il level through the format of parliamentary questions and Leaders' Questions.  Surely there is an onus on the Presidency of the European Union to convene a meeting comprising the Chairman and his 27 counterparts to ensure this issue is kept at the forefront of the agenda.  Europe must respond in a meaningful and practical way to try to reduce and eliminate the suffering of so many innocent human beings and prevent further loss of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#N00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1555,"content":"<p>The Deputy has come up with a good idea.

The suffering and exploitation of people is a very important issue.  I understand people are being charged &euro;1,000 to get on a boat on which they will likely die.  That is the reality of the situation.   People are being exploited.<\/p> <p>  The failure of the international community to recognise the problem that is creating this crisis must also be addressed at a broader level than the European one.  The problem in northern Africa, especially in Libya, is a bigger issue than can be addressed at European level.  We have had the inhumanity and the toleration of what has been taking place, which has led to the deaths that have occurred to date.  This is not a new issue.  The numbers are increasing.  People have been dying in their endeavour to get to Europe during the past two and half years.  The issue is not a new one but the scale of it has alerted the European Union which should have examined this.  Italy has been asking for this.  We should commend the Italian people on the response they have given to what they have been presented with for some time.  If this were a European issue and not an African one and people were leaving a European country and dying in their hundreds, we can imagine what would be the international community's response to it.  Internationally, we seem to have a different attitude towards Africa.  That has been seen in many other areas of exploitation going back to colonialism with respect to the exploitation of Africa.  There is the sense of there being a post-colonial negative attitude towards Africa.  It is manifested in our delay as Europeans to respond to what we know has been an issue.  We have known about the exploitation of people fleeing to Europe.  We know that people do not flee their countries just for the sake of doing so.  They do so because they have very serious issues of violence, murder and exploitation to deal with in their own countries.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is to be commended on bringing forward this issue.  I support the view that we should try to have a European-wide response from the committees involved rather than only from the Ministers because we want to support the Ministers in responding to the need that is out there.  Is anyone examining the drawing up of a solution to this issue because this issue will continue and escalate?  A solution to overcoming the difficulties in Africa must be found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#N00400","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1557,"content":"<p>It is welcome that we are having this discussion.<\/p><p>When the committee met with the EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, I raised with her this issue of migrants and the impact it was having on the EU.  There is no surprise at the lack of solidarity coming from Europe.  We would argue that there was a lack of solidarity on the Irish situation.  The people of Greece, Italy and Malta would argue that economically there has been that lack solidarity on other issues.<\/p><p> Regarding the recent events involving migrants, there is an element in our DNA regarding coffin ships, leaving our shores to flee poverty and hunger.  The Irish experience has a greater understanding of the plight of those who have been sealed into the bulks and hulls of ships in the Mediterranean.<\/p><p> War is coming nearer to Europe and this is an indication of it.  How do we respond to it?  We have two different approaches.  There is an election across the water where one of the main issues is migration.  Parties there are claiming this is not the way forward.  What impact would it have on Ireland if we had 10,000 people landing on our shores, looking for asylum and supports like what is happening in Italy?  We need to look at the legal route that people can actually use to come to Europe, opening it up to those who have skills and for those fleeing poverty, famine and conflict.<\/p><p> It is a scandal that Operation Mare Nostrum was wound down.  The Italian Navy had saved 100,000 people but the EU in its wisdom decided differently and pulled those ships back, relying on merchant shipping to deal with the issue.  I presume this was to save money.  Operation Mare Nostrum cost &euro;12 million a month while the new Frontex costs &euro;3 million a month.  It is saving money but at the cost of the lives of hundreds of people.  There is a ten-point plan but it is not up to scratch.<\/p><p> The committee needs to examine this issue.  To assist us in this, it might be useful for the committee to bring in some of the ambassadors from the countries directly impacted.  Over the past several weeks, 20 migrant boats came into Greece alone.  We all know what Greece is going through, so it is understandable there will be tensions in those countries too.  This is a whole European problem that needs to be solved within Europe.  One country having to shoulder the unfair burden of dealing with this matter is wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#N00500","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1559,"content":"<p>I know everyone wants to get in but if members could keep their contributions brief because we will be revisiting this matter again in a more comprehensive way.

To think these traffickers can extract as much as &euro;5,000 per person to get into these wrecks of fishing boats shows how much people want to get into Europe.

In November 2014, I attended the Inter-Parliamentary Conference for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy in Rome.  At this meeting, I pointed out to the EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, that what she was doing was an abdication of a duty of care.  Operation Mare Nostrum had five ships, helicopters, five aircraft, two submarines and 900 staff covering an area of 27,000 sq. km.  All of this assistance was withdrawn while the area covered was reduced to 30 km off the coast with one third of its original budget, one large ship and three small patrol boats.  The EU High Representative is now crying crocodile tears.  At that meeting in Rome, I also pointed out this move was willingly and knowingly condemning these people who were going to be put into these boats to die.  One foreign office decided the rescue missions had an unintended pull factor and did not act as a deterrent.  The idea was to get rid of the rescue missions and maybe people would stop trying to get across the Mediterranean.<\/p> <p>  Suddenly, now the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has a ten-point plan, one which as Deputy Crowe rightly said is not near good enough.  She has much to answer for.  She should actually resign because she oversaw all of this and knew it was going to happen.  There was an obvious outcome.  She will not fix the problem and she needs to be got rid of.  We need a new EU High Representative who will solve this problem.  The current rescue mission is only a Band-Aid.  The cause of this is climate change, the war in Syria, Libya and elsewhere in North Africa.  Former colonies have been abandoned by their previous masters and are now suffering the consequences, as Deputy Neville pointed out, of a post-colonial situation of which they are not equipped to take charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#O00400","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1562,"content":"<p>I call Senator Jim Walsh.

This has been left to the Italians and other Mediterranean states to deal with.  This shows a severe lack of political leadership at EU level where bureaucracy reigns supreme while the interests of citizens are secondary.  We have seen that ourselves in economic issues.<\/p> <p>  It is a pity it has taken a major disaster with a significant loss of life to get everybody to focus on the problem.  My understanding is the Italians were funding Operation Mare Nostrum, they sought EU financial support for it but it was not forthcoming.  As a consequence, because of its own fiscal situation, the Italians had to scale it back, spending a third of what they used to.<\/p><p>They are now spending approximately one third of what was spent previously to carry out what are in effect border control activities off the Italian coast to pick up migrants.  The European Union must support a proper sea rescue effort.  Last week, while visiting the Greek island of Samos, I watched a police vessel leave the harbour.  Local people told me that seven or eight migrants had been found earlier.  Migrants are arriving daily on the Greek island of Rhodes, which is close to Syria.  The loss of life among those making the journey at sea is significant. <\/p><p> Let us not forget that the people arriving at European ports are at great risk, not only at sea.  Last week, 31 Christians from Ethiopia were slaughtered by Daesh in Libya.  Migrants face risks even before they put to sea.  We are dealing with the symptoms of the problem.  The international community must address the core issue, namely, the current problems in the Middle East and Africa.  A search and rescue effort is needed.  The Government should take a much more proactive role and bring to bear Irish experience and empathy in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#O01000","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1569,"content":"<p>While I agree with most of the points made by previous speakers, there is a slight difference between the position of certain countries and our position.  While the European Union must address its responsibilities in a more serious manner, we should not forget that the EU is a union of states within which there is a certain amount of resentment towards immigrants.  It should be borne in mind, for example, that people are being elected to national parliaments and the European Parliament on the basis of their antipathy towards immigrants.  It is not entirely the European Union which has shirked its responsibility on this matter, although I agree it is in the best position to co-ordinate a response.  It must first establish safe havens in the countries from which people are being trafficked and intervene in a meaningful way to ensure traffickers no longer have free reign to do as they wish.  Women and children are being trafficked, abused and knowingly sent them to their deaths when they are sent out on the high seas.<\/p> <p>  An alternative suggestion is to establish safe havens for migrants in Europe and a properly structured refugee reception centre for people who are being driven from their homelands.  The reason people are desperate to leave their home countries is that they are living in conflict zones where people are starving and human rights are ignored.  Women, in particular, are conscious of the fate that awaits them and their children if they remain in these countries.  The joint committee should involve Mr. Peter Sutherland, the United Nations special representative for migration, who echoes these views from time to time.  We should also contact various people, including the EU High Representative, Ms Mogherini, with a view to co-ordinating efforts.  It is fine for people elsewhere in Europe to argue the problem is one for Italy and Greece.  However, it is a Europe-wide problem and one for which every European country, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, France and the Scandinavian countries, have equal responsibility.  I would strongly support any move to approach our European Union colleagues at Commission level to try to activate people who are of like mind. <\/p> <p>  It is no good allowing the traffickers to continue to do their damnedest without interruption.  I am sure all Deputies have dealt with cases involving women and children who were drugged while being trafficked to ensure they could not recall their experiences.  The particular drug used in these types of cases prevents trafficking victims from giving evidence because they cannot remember what happened to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015042200002#P00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1429693200,"counter":1570,"content":"<p>Members have made a number of proposals, including contacting Mr. Peter Sutherland, the United Nations special representative for migration.

We will record the decisions of the committee.  The committee has received a total of 136 petitions to date since the launch of the petitions system.  Some 124 of those petitions have been brought before us on at least one occasion.<\/p><p>Today, we will discuss nine petitions.  The first petition is No. P00018\/14, in respect of Mr. James Dooney, regarding the lack of systems in place to allow a psychiatric nurse transfer to a suitable geographical area.  I propose that this petition remain open and, following agreement with the petitioner, it will be brought before the joint committee for full consideration at a later date.  This petition, as currently worded, relates to an individual and is an issue of importance.  If the petition is changed to reflect a broader issue, then our committee will revisit the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The second petition is No. P00027\/14, in respect of Mr. Alan Moran, regarding the holding of an abortion referendum.  The committee has agreed that we will get advice and that it is inadmissible.  The committee has agreed that we will get advice from the parliamentary legal adviser and refer the matter back to the committee at a later stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next petition is No. P00028\/14, in respect of Ms Elizabeth Shannon, which calls for the resignation of two judges.  The recommendation from the committee is that all correspondence be returned to the petitioner, in accordance with section 92(4) of the inquiries Act.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The petition is closed and is inadmissible.<\/p><p>The next petition is No. P00033\/14, in respect of Mr. Michael Power, regarding discrimination in the primary medical certificate.  This petition is deemed to be inadmissible because it has been dealt with by an ombudsman.  However, the issue raised by Mr. Power is being addressed in two other petitions.  We will keep Mr. Power briefed even though we cannot accept his petition because it is inadmissible.  We will keep him briefed on the progress of the other two petitions out of courtesy.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next petition is No. P00035\/14, in respect of Dr. Franka Winter, which is  entitled, &quot;Married person tax credit not for migrants&quot;.  The petition is deemed inadmissible because the petitioner has not demonstrated that he has exercised all of the avenues of appeal.  However, we understand that the issues raised have since been addressed.  That is a good outcome for the petitioner in this regard.  Is it agreed that the petition is inadmissible although there has been a good outcome?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next petition is No. P00036\/14, in respect of Ms Noreen Corcoran, re health care <i>v<\/i>. water charges.  The petition is inadmissible as the issues raised are inadmissible under Standing Order 165C(2) which states:<\/p><blockquote>In relation to admissible petitions, where a petition deals with-(a) local or regional matters; or<br \/><br \/>(b) matters which are more appropriate to a regulatory public body or a body established for the purpose of redress;the Committee shall establish that all available avenues of appeal or redress have been utilised by the petitioner prior to the Committee considering the matter.<\/blockquote>  <p>Is it agreed that the petition is inadmissible because of those terms?  Agreed.<\/p><p>The next petition is No. P00042\/14, in respect of Mr. Daniel Pena, which is  entitled &quot;Sasam&oacute;n, new bridge between Ireland and Spain.&quot;  Sasam&oacute;n is a location in Spain and the term &quot;new bridge&quot; refers to a new cultural bridge between Ireland and Spain.  We could not deem the petition admissible because it does not deal with matters that are pertinent to the Houses or specific to this committee that would come under the remit of the committee or these Houses.  However, we did think what he had to say had merit.  Therefore, we will refer these matters and will write to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We will bring the suggestions mentioned in the petition to their attention and we will ask them to respond to the petitioner.  Although this committee cannot deal with the petition, we hope the petitioner will appreciate our efforts.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p><p>The next petition is No. P00001\/15.  It is considered frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the petitions system as the telephone number and e-mail address do not exist.  I wish to state that it is disappointing that anyone would submit such a petition and engage in such nonsense.  This is an important system for citizens and many citizens engage in it, give of their time and make an effort, plus this is a new committee in this Oireachtas.  The petition has been ruled out.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  <\/p>  <p>                 The next petition is No. P00005\/15, in respect of Mr. Thomas Keary, and is entitled \"Unpaid salary for night duty worked\".  We have looked at the Standing Orders.  We think this person has raised the issues with the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner which means the matter has been through the due process.  Our Standing Orders do not allow us to revisit issues that have been addressed by the Ombudsman, the Courts Service, the Labour Court or the systems that are in place.  We will advise the petitioner to look at trade unions and whether there are new legislative or policy areas that could be examined.  We have to deem the petition inadmissible.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015042200002#S00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1429714800,"counter":1582,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned 7 p.m. until 4 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 April 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications","time":1429691400,"counter":1583},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Timmy Dooley, Deputy Terry Brennan.

I am very pleased to accept the invitation to come before you today to discuss the provisions of this year's update of the Road Traffic Act.  The AA is Ireland&rsquo;s motoring organisation and has been around since 1910, so we have a century of history in Ireland.  Our original reason for coming into being was to act in good faith to help responsible motorists and represent their views to Government, and in turn to support policies that ensure the safety, fair treatment and long-term interests of our members.<\/p> <p>  We are quite a big organisation.  In addition to being a motoring organisation, we provide consumer services.  We have around 200,000 roadside breakdown customers and we sell motor and travel insurance.  We attend to well over 100,000 car breakdowns per year, with 80% of them fixed on the spot.  We also try to put information into the consumer's hands.  Our AA Roadwatch service, of which Ms Foley is the editor, provides up to the minute traffic and travel data through live broadcasts, online and social media.  We have over 90,000 Twitter followers.  We engage very regularly in communication with members of the motoring public and given that we have a century of history doing it, we act on their behalf to represent their interests and they tell us what they feel on the issues.<\/p> <p>  In the last 20 years or so, we have been very active in the area of road safety.  I have been there for all that time myself, so I have spent my whole career doing little else.  Success has many fathers, but if one looks at road safety policies in general in Ireland over the last 10 to 15 years, a key reason for that success has been buy-in from the motoring public.  There has been a sea change in attitudes towards road safety over that period of time and the AA has played an important part in championing road safety policies to the motoring public.<\/p> <p>  We research the beliefs of Irish motorists systematically.  We have a degree of engagement with our customers which very few organisations can match.  We regularly survey our members and customers by email and get thousands of responses.  We ask AA members perhaps 20 multiple choice questions about policy issues and expect over 10,000 completed questionnaires to be returned.  We frequently ask them their views on road safety topics and broadly speaking 75-80% of the motoring public buy into road safety policies.  They support things like tougher penalties, extra garda&iacute;, and speed cameras.  However, there is also a cohort of 15-20% who are cynical.  They do not believe it.  They are convinced it is a racket and that it is about revenue creation.  Whenever we do something about road safety, we must always make a conscious effort to demonstrate good faith.  We may never convince all those people, but we must be sure to stay evidence-led and to act in good faith to persuade the doubters.<\/p> <p>  As the committee knows, the Road Traffic Act must be an evolving piece of legislation because technology and social behaviour change and the law must evolve to keep up.  On this occasion, in the 2015 Act, there are a number of key changes.  In some cases these are relatively unimportant and technical and are just necessary updates to the law, while in other cases they are a bit more profound.  As we read the draft of the legislation, we reckoned there were nine areas of significance.  These are in the document we submitted to the committee, so I will not read it word-for-word, but I will say a few words on each area, in no particular order, and there may be questions later.<\/p> <p>  The first area is drugs and driving.  The Act will allow garda&iacute; to use a mouth-swab or other detection kit in the same way that they use a breathalyser for alcohol.  In other words, along with the roadside breath check, there would also be a drugs check.  That would be a screening mechanism, and a motorist who tests positive would thereafter be asked to provide an evidential sample, which could trigger a prosecution.  From a road safety point of view, that is very welcome.  One could have no reservations about it and it has to be a good thing.  We know that drugs are being used while driving.  The jury may still be out on the data on that, and I know there is some research going on, so it is hard to quantify, but we know it is there.  However, we must also point out that the drafting of regulations that flow from this provision in primary legislation will be very important because there are things we must avoid.<\/p><p>It is a problem, technically, at this time.  There is no device as effective as the alcohol breathalyser.<br\/><br\/>I am not an expert in this area but I know from conversations with people such as Professor Denis Cusack, whom I am aware the committee has met, that there are some types of drugs in respect of which trace element can exist after impairment.  This is potentially a problem because we do not want roadside road safety checkpoints turning into de facto random drug tests for the population.  We must ensure that we are concentrating on impairment caused by illegal or legal drugs rather than on trying to detect the drugs.  That must be the focus.  The control of illegal drugs is a matter for other legislation rather than road safety legislation.  That said, we must ensure we are concentrating on impairment and are only seeking to detect where motorists are actually impaired by drugs.  In that context, the AA can unreservedly support the provision.  <br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, we are speaking in this regard about two key types of drugs, including legal drugs used on prescription or abused by the user - classically, benzodiazepines and so on - and illegal and illicit drugs.  The provision contained in this Bill will essentially allow the Garda to screen for drugs in the same way as they screen for alcohol.  On the whole, I believe this is a good measure but advise caution around the drafting of the detail in this regard.  It is important we ensure that road safety legislation does not stray out of its territory and seek to address issues that should be addressed under the misuse of drugs legislation.  Nevertheless, it is a good provision.  Concerns have been expressed by employers about the implications of their having to put in place a drug screening or testing regime for drivers.  This might be a concern as regulations are drafted.  The drugs issue is one of the key provisions, probably the most significant new provision, contained in this Bill.  <br\/><br\/>Another issue addressed is the use of mobile phones while driving, which is a perennial problem.  We do not yet know how to keep up with technology in terms of legislation.  It is proposed that under this Bill it will be an offence to use any type of electronic device for a data input exercise.  In other words, it does not matter if it is a SatNav, tablet or something not mentioned in current legislation, it will be an offence to use a connected device to obtain information while driving.  This will close off loopholes in current law and will probably be a good provision.  It is unlikely to be the last word on these devices because the technology is constantly changing.  We may have to look again at issues such as voice activated searches for the Internet etc. and whether they are a distraction.  The legislation does not seek to outlaw making a hands-free mobile phone call while driving, which is probably pragmatic because it would be almost impossible to implement.  Nevertheless, in parallel with the legislation we need to continue with education to persuade people that, even if not technically in breach of the law, regularly engaging in hands-free mobile phone conversations while driving is a bad habit and a poor driving practice.  This a good provision in the law that will close off some gaps and improve things.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill provides for the imposition of three penalty points in respect of the driving of a heavy vehicle with a trailer greater than 3.5 tonnes without the proper driving licence.  My colleagues in the technical area have welcomed this.  It appears that is a little overdue.  There is also an important provision around written-off vehicles, which, again, is a consumer protection concern.  It will become an offence to drive a vehicle that has been a write-off in a public place, unless it is exempted by regulation.  These exemptions will close off the rare but not completely rare case whereby a car is technically a write-off but is physically repaired uneconomically and is now sound on the road.  This does happen from time to time.  This legislation will allow for that by regulation but it will also provide for much greater control of vehicle write-offs and enable a proper national register of written-off vehicles.  While this currently happens as an administrative process, the provision provided for in this legislation will put it on a statutory footing, which is welcome.<br\/><br\/>Other work needs to be done on this issue, which is outside the scope of the current legislation which, as I said, will not be the last word on this.  We would like to see a proper public open-source database which allows any motorist or person to at any time poll a car's registration number and automatically obtain relevant data about that car which already exists, including its mileage which is captured by the NCT, its collision history, its service history, ownership history and so on, all of which information should be freely available.  Currently, it is not available because databases do not co-operate and because in many cases people are wary of falling foul of data protection legislation, which to us appears a little silly.  I do not know of a legitimate data protection need which would seek to prevent somebody finding out the mileage on my car given that I could sell my house tomorrow and any citizen can find out what price I got for it.  To me it seems a little silly not to share information about a car because of data protection concerns.  I believe we need to do much more in this space.  There should be no reason that information, which we already have, should not be made publicly available.  This is a reasonably good provision but cannot be the last word in this area.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also provides for mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK.<b><i><\/i><\/b>This is a technical change to the law.  It is a change to the basis on which that law is founded, from an EU convention to a bilateral arrangement with the UK.  This follows on from measures taken by the UK, which are outside our control.  It is only a technical provision but it is a continued signal to what is an important continuation of policy.  In addition to recognising each other's driving qualifications it is a road safety policy imperative to move towards closer harmonisation with the UK.  It would be lovely to have close harmonisation throughout Europe but that is not going to happen for a long time.  In the mean time, it makes pragmatic sense to dovetail with the UK, with which we have a similar culture and share a land Border.  Also, in both countries driving is on the same side of the road.  There are many areas of interaction between the jurisdictions.  If I drive into Belfast at 100 km\/h, in terms of natural justice, I should not get away with that just because I have crossed an invisible border within the European Union.  We have to improve bilateral co-operation with the UK.  We need to move to mutual recognition of each other's penalty points systems.  Again, this is a perfectly reasonable provision but it cannot be the last word in this area.  There is a policy imperative to improve co-ordination between ourselves and the UK.<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>The Bill includes another provision which, again, tidies up existing custom and practice and law, namely, the sharing of insurance information by insurers.  Insurers are already obliged to provide a Minister, the Garda and the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland with details on new policies created and on existing policies cancelled.  This legislation makes more specific the nature of the information that can be shared.  Ostensibly, this might be seen as setting aside or acting outside of data protection considerations for a transparent, fully understood and good reason.  Motor insurers and certain other interested parties have to be able to share information because this will enable them to price accurately and fairly.  They will then also know if individuals are choosing to cherry pick from one insurer to another in an effort, perhaps, to disguise a poor accident or collision record.  It is in everybody's interest that this is done intelligently.  Once again, this cannot be the last word in this area.  There needs to be broader and deeper co-operation in the sharing of information.  Generally speaking, this is a reasonably good provision. <br\/><br\/>One of the provisions in this law which is likely to be eye-catching, even from a PR point of view, is that related to cyclists.  Cyclists will now be obliged to provide on demand to a garda the same information that a motorist is currently obliged to give to a garda, with application of the same penalties if they choose to refuse to do so.  Everybody would accept that this is a sensible idea.  Everybody recognises that cyclists, while typical of the general population in that most of are very decent and law abiding, there is no doubt that some are poorly behaved and that there is a perception that there is very little that the Garda can do about this.  This provision will strengthen the hand an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is probably a good provision.  In the longer term we can never arrive at a situation whereby a cyclist is treated the same as a motorist.  I am instinctively uncomfortable with penalty points for cyclist offences.  We need to recognise that at a deeper level motorists have the greater burden of responsibility.  Cyclists do not knock down cars and kill them.  The opposite is the case.  It will always be the case that the use of a motor car is more tightly regulated and that transgressions in that regard are more severely punished than would be the case in respect of a cyclist.  I think that is reasonable.<br\/><br\/>There is to be a change to the speed limit law to allow for variable speed limits at roadworks, which is sensible.  It should go through and be uncontroversial.<\/p><p>It is a measure that is included in the speed limits review published in the autumn of 2013 which took effect last year.  It is unreservedly good.  It should not be controversial, provided local authorities administer it correctly.<\/p><p> The last new provision which conceivably is eye-catching but likely to be uncontroversial, certainly from a road safety point of view, is aimed at having tighter laws on what are called sulky races - informal races on public roads involving horse-drawn vehicles and typically organised by members of the Traveller community.  I appreciate that there are cultural and respect issues about this activity to which we have to be sensitive and I do not claim it is our area of expertise, but purely from a road safety point of view, this is an entirely sensible measure which will mean that races can continue but a local authority licence will be required.  Anyone participating in an unlicensed event will be guilty of an offence.  This unregulated activity presents an unacceptable risk to the general public.  While we desire to facilitate long-standing traditions of the Traveller community, it is very important that we act in the interests of public safety.  On that basis, the AA supports this measure.<\/p><p> Broadly, there are some important and more technical measures included in the legislation, the broad thrust of which can be welcomed, but it is very much dependent on careful drafting of the regulations that will flow from it.  Otherwise we will find ourselves at a similar committee discussing how to tidy it up in future iterations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1591,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Faughnan who has given us a lot of food for thought.

The new Bill is particularly timely as we have seen an increase in the numbers of road deaths in the past two years.  New measures are needed to tackle existing and new road safety challenges.  I am accompanied by Mr. Declan Naughton, director of driver licensing and testing, and Ms Miriam Scott who are here to assist with specific details if someone has a question that falls within the remit of the RSA. <br\/><br\/>I would like to begin by giving a brief overview of the position on road safety today, as well as providing some context for the measures included in the heads of the Bill.<br\/><br\/>A total of 49 people have been killed on the roads in 43 fatal collisions so far this year.  That is seven fewer than the number this time last year, which is to be welcomed, although it is certainly not something to be complacent about.<br\/><br\/>In the past decade Ireland&rsquo;s road safety record has improved measurably thanks to the work of many agencies and individuals, some of whom are present, working in a strategic way to prevent deaths and injuries on the roads.  In the ten year period from 2003 to 2013 the number of road fatalities fell from 335 - almost one a day - to 188, a decline of 44%.  In the same ten-year period we have seen a reduction of 16% in the number of serious injuries.  However, since 2013 the numbers of road deaths have begun to rise once more.  Last year there was a 4% increase to a total of 195.  The current road safety strategy which runs from 2013 to 2020 has set a specific target to reduce the number of deaths on the roads to 124 a year and the number of serious injuries to 330.  These drops are necessary to close the gap between Ireland and other best performing countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden and Australia. <br\/><br\/>I would like to add context to some of the contributory factors in collisions.  Driver error represents the single biggest contributory factor, accounting for at least 80% of fatal collisions in recent years.  As previously stated, we know that speed, impaired driving through alcohol, drugs, fatigue or distraction, the non-wearing of seat belts and unsafe behaviour by or towards vulnerable road users remain the main contributory factors, both here and internationally.  I would like to give an overview of the evidence for some of these factors, focusing on the topics of particular relevance to the new Bill. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Excessive speed<b><\/b>was cited as a contributory factor in 15% of all fatalities<b><\/b>and 11% of all serious injuries in the period 2002 to 2012.  From our analysis of road collision data, we can confirm that speed related fatal or serious injury collisions are most likely to occur during the summer months on rural roads; on roads with a speed limit of 80 km\/h or 100 km\/h; on bends; and, tragically, involve male drivers aged between 17 and 24 years, followed closely by male drivers aged 25 to 34 years.  From our observational studies of drivers in recent years, we also know that as many as eight in ten drivers exceed the posted speed limit on urban roads, while a lower proportion, about one in five, exceed the speed limit on higher speed rural roads.  The extent to which drivers engage in speeding in urban areas poses a significant threat to the safety of vulnerable road users.We firmly believe a reduction in speed limits in residential areas specifically and urban areas generally is crucial to protect the safety of vulnerable road users based on all of this evidence. <br\/><br\/>On impaired driving<b>, <\/b>alcohol has played a significant role as a causal factor in road traffic collisions in Ireland, as well as in the rest of the world.  Previous research in Ireland indicated that alcohol had been a factor in over 36% of fatal crashes in 2003 and over 28% in 2004 and 2005.  The Road Safety Authority analysed the role alcohol had played in fatal collisions in a two year study period from 2005 to 2007.  This period was relevant to establish the effectiveness of the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, which came into play in July 2006.  This provision allowed the Garda to breath-test a driver without the requirement of having formed an opinion that the driver had consumed alcohol.  It allowed the Garda to test a greater number of drivers than had previously been permitted.  <br\/><br\/>The study also analysed the cases in which a breath test had been administered in cases involving a fatal collision.  The result of the analysis showed that there had been a significant reduction in the role alcohol had played in fatal collisions during the period.  It showed that the number of cases in which alcohol had played a part had decreased to 15.5% in 2007, from 28% in 2005.  This was a significant reduction and appeared to be directly related to the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing in 2006. <br\/><br\/>Professor Cusack from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, when he appeared before the committee last Thursday, referenced a report on roadside drug testing, in which there was a section on prevalence.  Chapter 3, in particular, provided a most comprehensive overview of the available data for drug driving.  A review of road collisions and an analysis of drug and alcohol toxicology results from the Coroner&rsquo;s Court in Kildare during an 11-year period, from 1998 to 2009, showed that of 92 driver deaths examined, a positive toxicology result for alcohol and-or drugs was recorded in 50% of cases, while there was almost a 10% figure for the number of cases in which drugs had had an influence.  A prevalence rate of one driver in ten being under the influence of drugs undoubtedly points to a need to have an intoxicant impairment testing regime.  We also know, as Mr. Faughnan stated, that there is strong public support for such testing.  Our own survey of public attitudes among 1,000 motorists conducted as recently as November 2014 showed that 93% of motorists agreed that the Garda should have the power to conduct roadside testing to detect drug use.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the State body with responsibility for the testing of all blood and urine specimens taken by garda&iacute;, tells us that in the case of approximately one in ten drivers killed in a crash there will be a positive toxicology result for a drug or drugs.<\/p><p>As Professor Cusack outlined last week, a two-step process has been identified to tackle the drug driving problem.  The first step was the introduction, in December of 2014, of the field impairment testing.  This new roadside impairment test provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to test drivers whom they suspect of driving under the influence of drugs.  The second step, introduced in this Bill, will see the introduction of roadside chemical testing, which is modelled on successful mandatory alcohol screening.  When in use, it will test for certain key drugs like cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines which are the most prevalent in drugged drivers.  I have no doubt that such additional powers will mean more drug drivers apprehended by garda&iacute; and the fear of being arrested and disqualified from driving will force drivers to reconsider such dangerous behaviour, similar to alcohol testing introduced some years ago. <\/p><p> International evidence suggests that driver distraction is a contributory factor in up to 30% of all collisions.  Experts in the area say that distraction can be any one of three types: manual which is hands off the wheel, visual which is eyes off the road or cognitive distraction which is mind off the road.  A distraction can be internal or external to the vehicle be it manual, cognitive or visual.  For example, texting or using a mobile phone in any other form, can potentially include all three types of distraction -  the mobile phone is in the hand and the hands are off the wheel, the mind is off driving and the eyes are off the road.  International evidence suggests that texting while driving makes one four times more likely to crash. <\/p><p> Of all drivers aware of the increase in penalty points for mobile phone use, three in ten say that since the introduction they now use their hand-held mobile phone less, but I believe that three in ten is still not enough.  Of the high risk group which admits to using the phone more regularly while driving, over half admit to now using their mobile phone less, so the culture is changing.  This is a very positive endorsement of the effectiveness of enforcement measures in changing public behaviour.  Further strengthening of legislation on the use of electronic devices is welcomed in the Road Traffic Bill and is to be expected in future Bills.  It is, as Mr. Faughnan pointed out, a changing technology and it continues to pose new threats.<\/p><p> I will now turn to vehicle defects.  The most recent data available show that vehicle defects have contributed to 3% of fatal road collisions and to 1.5% of serious injury collisions over the period 2007 to 2012.  Tyre issues are most likely to feature.  This data are based on the preliminary investigation of vehicles by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A more detailed vehicle inspection, conducted as part of the forensic collision examination, will provide a more accurate assessment of the extent to which vehicle defects contribute to collisions.  Preliminary results from the pre-crash behaviour study indicate that worn, bald tyres and inappropriate pressure of tyres, contribute to collisions to a greater extent than previously thought.  <\/p><p> There is new provision in the regulations for written-off vehicles.  This is a key component in ensuring a high standard of vehicles in the national fleet.  It is essential that severely and irreparably damaged vehicles are never let back on our roads.  Where a vehicle can be repaired, it would only be allowed back into service if repaired correctly by competent people.  Having a firm statutory basis in road traffic law will allow the Minister, in conjunction with other Government Departments and public bodies, including the Road Safety Authority, to progress the implementation of a robust system for dealing with written-off vehicles in Ireland.  The current position on information provision is that insurance companies voluntarily notify, through a third party, the Department&rsquo;s driver and vehicle computer services division, DVCSD, in Shannon of vehicles that are damaged beyond repair.  These are statutory write-offs and the DVCSD lock these vehicles down so that no transactions may take place such as motor tax renewal or change of ownership.  In 2014, there were 2851 vehicles notified to the DVCSD as being statutory write-offs and their details were locked down.  The current process is administrative and although it is subscribed to by most insurance companies, it does not have a statutory footing.  Categories of vehicle write-offs are not legally defined and motor insurance companies are not compelled to provide the written-off vehicle information to the DVCSD.  The current register does not account for financial write-offs, also known as economic write&ndash;offs.  In such cases, insurance companies can use their own inspection and certification procedures to allow the vehicles back on the road.  Estimates suggest that over 45,000 vehicles are written off by motor insurance companies in each year.  Of these, an estimated 18,000 financial write-offs make their way back onto roads.  <\/p><p> The RSA carried out a review, with full public consultation, which identified legal and procedural shortcomings existing in the current system for dealing with written-off vehicles.  As a result, the RSA issued proposals to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  As a first step, the appropriate primary legislation needs to be put in place.  The draft head of this Bill before the committee will allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to make regulations on the use, detention and destruction of written-off vehicles.  The Minister will be able to define the various categories of written off vehicles, specify the written-off register to be maintained and prescribe the credentials of those who may make a determination that a vehicle has been written-off.  The Bill will provide the primary legislative basis to allow written-off vehicles to be assigned either of two core classifications - a statutory write-off or a financial write-off.  Statutory write-offs are vehicles that are damaged to such an extent that their integrity of construction is seriously compromised.  These vehicles are unsafe to go back on the road and must be disposed of correctly in line with end of life vehicle requirements.  This will eliminate the possibility of such vehicles making their way onto roads again and will also prevent them from becoming an environmental hazard through illegal dumping.  This addresses the market forces that may see Ireland as having a loophole in disposal of such vehicles.<\/p><p> With regards to mutual recognition of driver disqualification, the UK and Ireland have, since 28 January 2010, recognised licence disqualifications across each other&rsquo;s borders.  This was a very isolated case as not all European jurisdictions do that and we had a very good relationship.  As the UK withdrew from certain legal frameworks that enabled this to happen, from 1 December 2014 mutual recognition of licence disqualification does not apply to cases where a driver was disqualified after that date.  Both jurisdictions recognised the value of this measure and are taking steps to restore mutual disqualification.  The  necessary legislation and memorandum of understanding are being worked on to effect this.  The Road Traffic Bill 2015 incorporates the necessary provisions from Ireland's point of view. <\/p><p> The provisions applied to court disqualifications for offences that were similar in both jurisdictions.  It did not apply to penalty point disqualifications, the danger of which was raised by Mr. Fintan Towey in discussions about the complexity of the issue with this committee last week.  The types of offences include speeding, drink driving, dangerous driving and hit and run cases.  The role of the Road Safety Authority, in the mutual recognition of disqualifications, was to take cases here when we were notified by UK authorities that a person was disqualified in the UK but gave an Irish address as his or her residence.  In addition, the Road Safety Authority forwards to the UK licensing authorities details of cases where a person disqualified here gives an address in the UK.   Given the differing legal systems, the RSA goes through the court system to apply the disqualification whereas the UK applies disqualifications administratively, without having to take court proceedings.<\/p><p> I want to express my sincere thanks on behalf of the Road Safety Authority to all members of the committee and their colleagues in all parties in the Oireachtas for the encouragement and continued support provided to us on the issue of road safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1595,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murdock for her comprehensive presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#H00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>I thank both parties for their thoughtful presentations.

People were able to successfully challenge this for decades.  The difficulty I have with the impairment notion is that it is subjective, to some extent, unless there is a capacity to measure.  The delegation spoke about the need to provide for that in secondary legislation, and concerns that it not be seen to be prurient in nature, a concern which I share, and used for other evidential purposes rather than just saving lives on the roads.  Is it possible to have a methodology in place that measures the concentration of the intoxicant or the impairment by virtue of the quantity of the drug in the system?  We have a model for alcohol consumption.  There are some who might argue that even if they are above the limit, they might not be impaired to the extent that someone else might be.  My concern is that impairment will go back to the old debate about alcohol intoxication.  Is it possible to measure definitively the concentration of a drug and its impairment on some scale which would stand the test of the battery of legal eagles that will ensue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#H00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429691400,"counter":1597,"content":"<p>I know the committee has spoken to Professor Denis Cusack, director of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, who would have greater expertise on this.  Alcohol has been well researched in so many jurisdictions over such a long period.  Although a 50 mg\/dL level may impair one individual more than it impairs another, at least there is such a large body of evidence that we can draw a definitive line in the legislation stating that it does not matter whether one is impaired or not in one&rsquo;s judgment, the law states that 50 mg\/dL is the limit and one cannot go north of that.  At least that gives everybody clean rules to follow.  It also means we do not prosecute somebody who had a chocolate liqueur at lunchtime.  Unfortunately, for other types of drug, that level of research and data simply does not exist to enable legislators to draw a clear line.  In the same way, there is no blow-in-the-bag equivalent.  The UK authorities have introduced definitive permitted blood levels for, say, THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in cannabis.  I know I am straying from my area of expertise, but I have been told this is problematic and would not be recommended in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  What is proposed in Ireland is a little more pragmatic.  There are two stages to drug testing.  A garda will be able to administer the roadside screening test only if he or she forms an opinion of impairment or if there is a properly constituted checkpoint.  It is the same as for alcohol.  One cannot randomly pick people out of the stream of traffic.  A garda must set up a checkpoint and then he or she can breathalyse a driver.  After the checkpoint has been set up, the screening device can also be used.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety will be the body charged with ensuring we get the right screening advice and licensing and certifying it.  The intention is to go for a screening device which will only read positive where there is clear evidence of recent significant drug use.  Physically doing that could prove problematic.  The intention is to screen so that a person would be required to provide a definitive sample for evidence only if he or she has a level that would imply impairment.  That could work reasonably well.  When the person provides the definitive sample for evidence, the law proposes a very strict interpretation, so that even a minor trace could result in a prosecution.  I do foresee that this could become problematic and could be challenged.  The intention is to use a screening device only to pick up people who have enough in their systems to be impaired.  Only those people can then go forward to provide a sample which can be used in evidence.  That is probably the best and most pragmatic way it can be done.  It would do so much good on the road that it is worth supporting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1598,"content":"<p>Is it wishful thinking on the Government&rsquo;s behalf to create the algorithm in that device when the data is not available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#H00500","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429691400,"counter":1599,"content":"<p>The process proposed is mirrored with mandatory alcohol testing on the roads.

We need to be very careful not to put too much onus on employers by making them responsible and imposing penalties on them.

I put forward legislation on this subject in the D&aacute;il, relating particularly to residential areas.  I am aware that local authorities will have flexibility as to whether they introduce a limit of 20 km\/h, 30 km\/h, 40 km\/h or whatever, but it is important to look at this issue, as there has been a big increase in the number of children killed this year.  That is an added factor in considering a 20 km\/h limit and I would like to hear the opinions of the witnesses on that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked about testing for drugs, but the combination of drugs and alcohol is a big issue.  I have been of the opinion for a long time that a lot of people have been driving under the influence of drugs.  We are discussing bringing in a new offence involving a combination of drugs and alcohol, and that is fair.  It is one thing to take alcohol, but to take drugs, whether prescribed drugs or illegal drugs, creates a very dangerous situation, and I think it is a lot more prevalent than we realise.<\/p> <p>  What is the opinion of witnesses on the recording of cars that are written off?  We used to call them \"company cars\" and there used to be a lot of them in our area, but there are not so many today, as cars have got older.  Some of these cars did make their way back onto the streets, so it is welcome that we have a register of some description.  A significant percentage of cars that are not written off but, for insurance reasons, are declared to be not worth repairing are nevertheless being repaired and coming back on the road.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on that.<\/p> <p>  I know we are trying to enter into an arrangement with the UK on serious driving offences North and South, but it is important we push this on a European level.

Given my previous background, I am a bit of a poacher turned gamekeeper, so I do appreciate those concerns and the challenges that employers can face in enforcing a drugs and alcohol policy.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that we have improved safety, especially in the bus and truck industry where large fleets of vehicles carrying between 50 and 80 passengers and big transport operators with 40-tonne and larger vehicles are on our roads and are a serious risk under the control of an impaired driver.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the legislation is to set down in law the basis of impairment testing within organisations based on best practice.  There is a provision already, in the Health and Safety at Work Act, for employees to agree to intoxicant testing if it is deemed appropriate by their employer.  This is a further step that focuses on road safety.  We will see more detail in the actual regulations in terms of facilitating employers, but it is a very important step in improving road safety, especially in public transport.  It is not directed at small companies, taxi drivers, one-man bands or husband-and-wife teams but at transport operators who operate fleets of large vehicles carrying schoolchildren and other passengers.  It operates under a voluntary arrangement at the moment and a lot of bus operators already fit alco-locks on their vehicles to improve their safety.  We are doing this to ensure there is a safe system of work in transport companies whereby they are satisfied that their drivers are fit to drive and the public and their passengers are safe.<\/p><p>We will take on board the issues of small operators and small businesses in terms of enforcing something like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1612,"content":"<p>Will it specifically address the bigger operators?

Forensic tests and the coroner's reports into 92 deaths in County Kildare showed that 50% had traces of drugs and alcohol.  There is a misconception that must be changed in that regard.  There is a widespread belief that if one person in a group of people who are out together is not drinking alcohol but is smoking a joint, he or she should be the designated driver.  That misconception is prevalent and we fully acknowledge that.  Our responsibility is to raise awareness that drug taking is just as lethal as drinking in the context of road safety.  I would fully agree with the Deputy's point in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the recording of company cars as written-off vehicles, the Road Safety Authority hopes to introduce standards later this year for servicing, maintenance and repair shops.  That will hopefully address the issue of financial write-offs being reintroduced onto the market and ensure that they are repaired to a satisfactory standard and meet all safety requirements.  We will endeavour to ensure that vehicles are not on the road which have gone beyond a safe life.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of a 20 km\/h speed limit in residential areas, the Road Safety Authority is on record as being very supportive of that campaign.  We would agree that reducing speed has a significant impact on the safety of vulnerable road users.  Last year, as the Deputy pointed out, 14 children under the age of 14 were killed on our roads.  Seven of them were passengers and the other seven were pedestrians and speed was a major contributory factor.  We had our annual road safety conference on 2 April, the theme of which was child safety and a number of eminent speakers raised the issue.  Mr. Rod King from the UK spoke about the successful 20's Plenty for Us campaign which aims to roll out a 20 mph speed limit across all residential areas in the UK.  Their target is to have that fully implemented by 2020.  The debate has already started and action is happening out there and the Road Safety Authority is fully behind that campaign.  Our goal is to increase significantly the number of 30 km\/h zones in the first instance and local authorities have the power to this already.  The Bill we are discussing today provides that local authorities can enforce speed limits around road works  more effectively.  Likewise, they will have the authority to implement more 20 km\/h zones around residential areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock"},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1624,"content":"<p>Which is more effective in residential areas - a 20km\/h sign or a speed ramp?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#K01400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429691400,"counter":1625,"content":"<p>It is a combination of measures and not just one thing.

He said that he understood the commonsense, pragmatic approach of harmonising with the UK but would like to see similar harmonisation across the European Union and I completely agree.  That is quite a broadly-held view but practically, it will be a long time before it is achieved.  I have been reading about a pan-European system of penalty points since Mr. Neil Kinnock was the EU Commissioner for Transport 20 years ago.  Everybody buys into that as an aspiration but in practical terms, in order to improve the situation in Ireland today it makes much more sense for us to co-operate first off with the neighbours, with whom there is so much interaction, commerce and so forth.  That said, I would very much like to see it done across Europe eventually.<\/p> <p>  The issue that Deputy Ellis raised regarding the register of cars and company cars in particular is one that we have raised previously.  Let us say I have a company car that is end-of-life, that will never pass another NCT and is possibly up on blocks or just sitting in the drive way.  Someone rings my doorbell and offers me &euro;100 for it, which sounds great.  The person takes the car away but I discover several weeks later that the car has been recorded driving away from petrol stations or refusing to pay tolls or, in the worst case scenario, has been sold as a toy on the street and that youngsters have taken it to do donuts, play with it and eventually burn it out.  We are aware of some situations where that has resulted in fatalities.  <\/p> <p>  We have suggested previously that when a car reaches the end of its life and cannot pass an NCT any more, the last registered owner should be able to bring that car to a scrap yard and get tax back on it, a little like the coin in a supermarket trolley.  If people with such cars know that if they bring it to a scrap yard they will get &euro;200 as the last registered owner then that is what they will do.  They will not just sell it casually and let some youngster drive it away and burn it out.  We have suggested that on several occasions and believe that cars accrue enough tax-paid during their lifetime to cover the cost of refunding the last registered owner.  A bit like the money-back bottles, it would be worth peoples' while to do the right thing with their end-of-life cars instead of just letting it drift.  We would love to see that come about.<\/p> <p>  The point about drugs in combination with alcohol has been addressed by Ms Murdock and her response was absolutely correct.  On the increase in fatalities among children, one should note that the increase is proportional.  The Deputy knows that for many years there were 400 deaths per year on Irish roads.<\/p><p>In road safety terms, a lot of those were low-hanging fruit, including a ridiculous culture of drink driving and very little enforcement.  In addition, there was a custom and practice to challenge everything so that guilty people were never prosecuted.  That meant that over 400 people were killed on the roads every year.<\/p><p> As we started to get our act together on the simple policies that we knew worked elsewhere, a lot of that low-hanging fruit was taken out of it.  We have therefore gone from 400 road deaths per year to fewer than 200 but because of that, however, the ones that are left are much more problematic to address.  In a sense, it is geometrically more difficult to reduce from 200 to 100, than from 400 to 200.  That is why a lot of those genuinely tragic and apparently random accidents appear to be more common, as one is sorting out the accidents that can be addressed.  That may be one of the reasons why it is giving the appearance that child fatalities are worsening, while in absolute terms they are not. <\/p><p> Everybody agrees that Jake's law, which I know was supported by many parties in the D&aacute;il, is a big issue.  I did not support a blanket law to be applied to all residential areas across the country.  It was not that I disagreed with the effect, but I just do not think it would achieve its objective.  Our experience with blanket laws is that they turn out to be clumsy in reality and difficult to maintain.  I am not convinced that they would achieve the desired effect.  <\/p><p> To be cynical for a moment, if one has a sign up that says \"Caution - children at play\", why do we really believe that a sign with the number 20 on it would be more effective than that, in the absence of enforcement and other measures on foot of a blanket rule imposed from Dublin?  I am not convinced that it would achieve the desired result.  <\/p><p> We also have a circumstance where no two housing estates are alike.  Some are engineered for parking arrangements and with chicanes built in to ensure that it does not arise.  Some older estates might have a 300-yard straight strip run-in where a young driver could get up to 70 km\/h or 80 km\/h.  There are ways in which those can be addressed, but they have got to be done at an individual community level.  I never felt, and still do not feel, that a blanket, one-size-fits-all national law would have been the best road safety policy to pursue.  That is still my view, although I accept that other views are different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#K01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1628,"content":"<p>I do not think it is necessarily saying that blanket rules would apply but it is saying that in clearly defined residential areas a local authority could bring them in.

New schools are now being built with plenty of room for teachers to park.  The vast majority of our schools, however, are high risk areas for accidents.  I have taken photographs outside a national school in County Kildare where they had four or five signs on either side of the school, including flashing lights, 20 km\/h speed limit signs, and children holding hands.  Nonetheless, it did not succeed in slowing down traffic at the school.<\/p> <p>  Children are deposited there in the morning and collected in the evening by parents or public transport.  I have interviewed a teacher in the school concerned.  The only solution was when they put speed bumps on either side of the school, and one in the centre.  That was after a lot of money had been spent both by the local authority and the local people who were concerned for the safety of their children.<\/p> <p>  I strongly believe that we should consider the phased installation of speed bumps at all primary schools throughout the country, thus eliminating the daily risk morning and evening.  As I said, four or five signs were erected at that particular school but to no avail.  We cannot expect the authorities to monitor and enforce speed limits outside our schools, but a serious accident is waiting to happen.  Children are alighting from buses and crossing a road with traffic.<\/p> <p>  Does Ms Murdock think the phased installation of speed bumps at all primary schools would be a solution?

In many parts of the country, our road infrastructure approaches 19th century conditions.  The improvement of county roads is of particular importance.  One major road between Mallow and Mitchelstown is like a corkscrew it has so many bends.  There are narrow sections for the most part and huge black-spot bends.  It is a major route, but the issues have still not been addressed.  We could be talking about this from here to kingdom come if we do not get co-operation among local authorities, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and various bodies, including the RSA and the NRA.  There is a huge need for a major overhaul and vast improvement for our highly trafficked roads, particularly with regard to the onset of a huge volume of cyclists, cycling clubs and events.  Cycling events as fund-raisers are fine as they are controlled, proper stewardship is carried out and the roads are closed off for the most part, but for daily commuting and recreational cycling there are issues.  The roads are in hazardous condition and it is a wonder there are not more fatalities.<\/p> <p>  The increase in road accidents and fatalities in the summer was mentioned.  What sort of road awareness campaign is being planned with the onset of summer approaching?  There is a huge need to give an indication to people to leave good time to get to their destinations.  Rather than to give themselves 20 minutes to get somewhere, for example, they should give themselves 30, which is not much more.  Even I have the huge fault and habit of arriving just in time in normal conditions, which are not always there.  One can suddenly find one is trying to pick up speed on the road to make a schedule.  We need to bring in a huge sense of awareness.  I agree with Senator Brennan.  I saw around Clane, Kildare, a few years ago, a huge prevalence of speed bumps near schools.  Kildare is one county where they are utilising speed bumps in a very efficient manner.  Enforcement and compliance is impossible at all times because of the shortage of personnel to carry out policing.  The other successful thing I see is the flashing signs which indicate to motorists the speeds at which they are travelling.  If they are on an 80 km\/h road, it shows that they are doing 90 km\/h or 100 km\/h.  It is often the case on our regional roads.  There is a need for a complete programme to put flashing signs in place.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for lay-bys and pull-in spaces on the main highways for people to rest.  What are the statistics regarding tiredness?  We have spoken about medicines, drugs and alcohol, but do we have statistics on fatalities from common tiredness?  There is a huge need for improvements at junction exits and for public lighting at some.  More public lighting is required in built-up areas.  Signage for visitors from the continent which is common to their jurisdictions would be useful to keep drivers on the right side of the road.  Even Britain has different signage.  We have seen that rented cars are sometimes dangerous.  We know the native drivers are also dangerous as well, but it is not right that sufficient warning signs are not there for people from other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#M00100","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1637,"content":"<p>I thank the panel for their contributions this morning.  There were some very interesting contributions from members also.  I came late but I was listening to proceedings on the monitor in my office.<\/p> <p>  I seek the panel's views on the issue of culture.  We cast our minds back to the 1990s and the shocking figures referred to earlier.  The 1997 figure was appallingly high at something like 472.  If we go back even further to the 1970s, there were over 600 fatalities per annum on Irish roads.  If one consider how many fewer miles were travelled per annum in those years, it is appalling to consider those figures.  There were factors including poorer infrastructure, lack of driver training, a drink driving culture, poor motor vehicle technology and a lack of seat belt wearing.  I hope that in 2040 people look back at 2015 and say, \"By God, it is shocking that between 150 and 200 people died on Irish roads that year\".  I say I hope that because if it is the case, the figures will be substantially lower then.  How do we get to that?  I remember seeing recently that in 1970, when compulsory seat-belt wearing was introduced, people said it was the nanny state gone mad.  That was the culture of the time.  One of the things that has held back the putting in place of more proactive road safety measures is the fear from politicians of measures being considered draconian and over the top.  What I consider to be completely over the top is that we accept as a society that to get from A to B, almost 200 people will die on our roads.  How do we tackle that?  How do we apply the thinking of 2030 or 2040 today, which is what we need to do?  Had we applied 1990 thinking in the 1970s, one would have saved thousands of lives.<\/p> <p>  Should we be looking at embracing modern technology further including alco-locks to prevent one from starting and operating a vehicle where one is over 50 mg or one's breath shows one has alcohol on board?  Should we embrace GPS so that if one speeds in a 50 km\/h zone, one will be fined?  Should we look at what we have done with HGVs where there is a limiter?  I saw a car recently in one of the Sunday papers with a top speed of 260 km\/h, or something similarly ridiculously high.  The fastest one can travel legally on any Irish road is 120 km\/h.  Why do we have vehicles capable of doing that and why are they not limited?  There is an element of danger in overtaking, but one should not be overtaking anything faster than the speed limit that is imposed.<\/p><p>Should we consider requiring limiters?  I am sure there are people who might be watching these proceedings and thinking the suggestion is completely over the top because it will slow down traffic.  However, we need to ask ourselves as a society what price we are willing to pay to save a couple of hundred lives over the next decade.  It could be thousands of lives.  That is the broader question.  I am interested in hearing the panel's views on what is not being done that could be done to save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#M00200","speaker":"1051","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1639,"content":"<p>The last few comments were concerned with road safety in general, but if the witnesses wish to respond to them briefly, rather than speak on the Bill, that would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#N00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429691400,"counter":1640,"content":"<p>That is no problem at all.  I have taken some notes and I will try to deal with them in order.  Senator Brennan asked about the schools issue.  The RSA recognises fully that this is an issue.  It must be pointed out that some of the offenders are parents themselves, who can impede the safe depositing of kids from vehicles, including buses, and create a hazard which should not exist.  When they have finished depositing their kids, they head off.  Travelling at 30 km\/h, or even 20 km\/h, would be too fast in and around that area.  Through our road safety education officers, the authority is working closely with schools to try to generate campaigns within the schools.  Some schools have put in place effective measures which are very disciplined at the school gates.  The school transport system and Bus &Eacute;ireann have worked towards getting consolidated drop-off points.  In some areas, there will be three or four schools in the one locality and it is mayhem unless there is a dedicated pick-up and drop-off zone from where the kids can walk safely to the school.<\/p> <p>  Speed ramps would be appropriate in some locations.  Some more rural locations have schools on main roads.  I see one near Frenchpark on the way back to Ballina from Dublin.  There is a school on a main road.  It has flashing lights and, during school hours, these are fully active.  They alert drivers to slow down from the national speed limit to a safe limit going past the school.  This type of measure can prove very effective.  It is not certain whether it would be practical to put in speed bumps in those sort of areas.  They may not be suitable in some locations, but there must be some sort of alert system to tell a driver he or she is in a locality with children in the area and that it is necessary to respond appropriately.  <\/p> <p>  Schools can, together with the RSA in terms of its education and promotion functions, local authorities, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, look at specific needs within the school.  We fully support that approach.  It is a high risk area.  Children have been killed and injured getting off buses near schools.  In the United States, it is a federal offence to overtake a school bus when the flashing lights are on.  That is how the safety of school children alighting from and getting on school buses is addressed there.  It is a zero tolerance approach.  Various measures are available.  We have looked into having lights on school buses, but private vehicles are just as much a risk area.  A combined effort by the school community, parents, local authorities and our road safety officers is needed in and around schools as well as enforcement by the Garda.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Fleming raised the issue of investment.  The progress which has been made in the past ten years in road safety is in no short measure due to the improved infrastructure we have in the country.  Our motorways are our safest roads and it is critical that we continue with that upfront investment in road construction, including rural and national roads as well as motorways.  There also needs to be a proactive maintenance programme.  We need to fund it and to provide the necessary resources.  The RSA fully supports that.  A ministerial review will be held in early May involving all stakeholders, not just the RSA.  The National Roads Authority, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, local authorities and county council management will be involved.  We need to focus on all of these issues.  We need to continue in our approach and not lose the focus on road safety.  That is a risk not just in Ireland, but across Europe.  Road safety can slip down the priority list.  The EU road safety commissioner is making it a priority that this does not happen.  We are coming out of recession and we want to ensure that road safety gets as much investment and focus as it previously did.  That will remain part of our strategy from 2013 to 2020.  There are a number of key items on road infrastructure and maintenance on which we have to continue to deliver.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of our summer campaigns, we have community groups and our road safety officers operate all year round, not just during school time.  The number of road deaths increases during the summer months.  This results from a combination of factors.  The good weather in the past two years has facilitated more healthy lifestyles, including cycling, walking and playing in open greens.  This has resulted in a lot more children, pedestrians and cyclists on the roads.  Cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists, motorcycling being an option for touring around Ireland, were most impacted in terms of an increase in the number of fatalities.  It is really important that the message is out there during the summer months that we are looking out for remiss drivers and that the enforcement is there too.<\/p> <p>  Last year, the number of driver deaths fell by approximately 20%.  Our drivers are safer but our vulnerable road users felt the impact.  Unfortunately, people still allow themselves to be carried in a car without putting on a seat belt and drivers allow passengers to sit in the back seat without wearing seat belts.  This has also had an impact.  We have a summer campaign lined up.  In collaboration with the Garda, our bank holiday June message will be coming out and we will be doing various other things over the summer.<\/p> <p>  Lay-bys were mentioned.  These are a matter for the National Roads Authority and part of its road safety structure.  Tiredness is a big contributor to fatal collisions.  We estimate one in five drivers will suffer from driver fatigue and end up in a very serious if not fatal collision.  It is another form of impairment.  Statistics show that if someone has been awake for 17 hours or more, he or she has the same impairment as someone who is drunk at just under the legal limit of 0.5 milligrammes.  It has the same impact.  A driver needs to have a proper rest and to stop for a break, a coffee and a 15 minute refresh.  Impairment through fatigue is a serious risk. <\/p> <p>  We have a lot of signage in our leaflets and our promotional material for tourists and foreign drivers coming into the country.  We work with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as well as Tourism Ireland to improve signage reminding people to drive on the left in hire cars and around airports.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Griffin mentioned our views on culture.  The culture in the 1990s was extremely complacent and accepting of bad driver behaviour, be it drink driving, lack of enforcement or the quashing of penalty points.  All of that led to an increase in the number of road deaths above what should be socially acceptable.  Drink driving is nowadays considered very anti-social.  We hope to see the same change of culture in respect of technology, which is probably one of the biggest threats to safe driving in the future.  Children are being brought up with it at their fingertips.  It is being strapped to the headrests in cars.  Even that must be a distraction for drivers.  We need to educate our children to understand that when they graduate from the passenger seat to the driver seat, they need to leave the technology behind.  This will be a big cultural challenge and we will have to work together to do it.  We are starting with education.  We have primary and secondary school campaigns.  We are about to launch a junior cycle programme as part of the junior certificate which will be dedicated to road safety.  That will have a big impact.  Road safety will be part and parcel of the lives and psychology of young people growing up.  Through pester power, they will tell their parents how to drive safely.  We will do it not just through education, but through engineering and enforcement also.<\/p> <p>  Technology is a primary tool I want to use during my tenure as chief executive.  We need to use technology to improve roads and to combat the challenges technology poses for us.  Smart speed detection from GPS technology is being introduced in new vehicles.  Lane drift technology is already mandatory on new commercial vehicles.  It is mandatory that they have an ISA system, which is intelligent speed assist built through GPS.<\/p><p>If one is in a foreign country and accidentally exceeds the speed limit or drifts into a speed zone on an unfamiliar road, the technology will be available in new vehicles.  New commercial vehicles, including trucks and buses, will be required to have this technology.  The lane drift technology to alert a driver who may be falling asleep at the wheel is currently available.  We welcome the contribution these new technologies make to road safety because they will help to change the culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moyagh Murdock","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1429691400,"counter":1642,"content":"<p>Senator Brennan raised an important issue in regard to schools.  This issue is usually best managed at a local level because no two school gates are the same.  I would be reluctant to install speed bumps at all schools.  While schools are only open for 180 or 190 days per year for a few hours every day, speed bumps are a permanent fixture.  I am aware of certain locations in which residents have appealed for speed bumps to be installed only to call for their removal a few weeks later.  They can be disruptive and cause a thumping noise as vehicles traverse them.  They are not great in terms of creating a pleasant environment.  I do not know how much it would cost to install speed bumps outside every school in Ireland but one could purchase a considerable number of speed cameras for the same amount.  Flashing blue lights and speed cameras are great mechanisms for slowing drivers down and inducing them to concentrate.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Tom Fleming's point about the general conditions of Irish roads is possibly true but I remind him of our geography.  We have 96,000 km of roads in this country, or four times longer than Holland's roads on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.  We will never be able to connect every Irish village to a top quality road.  We must improve the world in which we live.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Brendan Griffin made a number of important points about improving road safety.  I agree that our standards are much higher than heretofore.  In the 1970s, we would have been triumphant if 195 people had been killed in one year but that is a disgraceful figure today.  While it is clearly positive that we have halved the number of road deaths over a ten year period, it might sober us up to learn that every OECD country has made similar gains.  This is mostly due to a determination to reduce the number of road deaths and a recognition that every road death is unnecessary.  There is no such thing as an accident.  It is a crash.  An accident absolves people of blame by implying it could not be changed but a crash is something we can control.  Almost ten years ago Sweden adopted a vision zero policy which stated that the only acceptable number of road deaths is zero.  It is not as important to make progress in absolute terms as to ensure that we are ahead of the curve.  Are we doing better than other developed nations or are we falling behind them?  When we look at our performance in isolation it is easy to pat ourselves on the back, but there are similar improvements in all developed nations, with the exception of the United States.  The rate of improvement in the United States varies considerably from state to state.  Famously, the US does not have a federal seat belt law and some states do not have local seat belt laws.  In many ways the US is behind the curve and it has a <i>per capita<\/i>death rate that European countries would regard as unacceptable.  <br\/><br\/>I agree that politicians often balk at passing what they regard as draconian laws.  I appeal to the members of this committee to have the courage to defend road safety laws even when they mean they will have a hard time at the church gates when they are seeking votes next April.  The road safety community needs their support because they are the only people who can give effect to policies that will save lives.<br\/><br\/>I am not a fan of alco-locks or speed limiters in most circumstances.  There are almost no speed related collisions between cars travelling faster than 130 km\/h.  A car can cruise at 130 km\/h on a motorway.  That is too fast but in all likelihood it is probably very safe, whereas the same car can be lethal if it is driven through a village at 70 km\/h.<br\/><br\/>In regard to cars and top speed advertisements, I agree that we have moved the mindset considerably.  In the &quot;Mad Men&quot; era, advertisers sold cars by draping a scantily clad female across the bonnet and boasting about how quickly the car went from stopping to 60 km\/h.  That does not tend to happen any longer because the typical car buyer is different.  Females are likely to be an influential voice in the purchasing decision and buyers are more likely to inquire about a car's crash test star rating than about its top speed.  I have always been curious about why car manufacturers never boast about how quickly a car goes from 60 km\/h to a stop, although that is a more relevant statistic.  This is partially a cultural issue but I think social values are moving in the correct direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1643,"content":"<p>I apologise for leaving the meeting earlier but I had to attend another meeting.

Rather than attempt to list the entire gamut of proscribed drugs, we recognise that drug combinations, trace drugs and prescribed drugs might also be involved.  In addition to enforcement, the Bill also aims to deter people from taking the risk of driving while under the influence of drugs.  I still expect some challenges to be brought but we will work to ensure the legislation and associated regulations are as straightforward as possible.  Given that drug driving is becoming more prevalent, it would be wrong to decide against introducing the legislation out of fear it will be challenged.  We will learn from our mistakes and fix loopholes when they arise but under our Constitution people have the right to challenge a charge made against them.

This is a complicated area.<\/p><p>Many people who voice their opinion to us wish for technology or knowledge that simply does not yet exist.  Many people ask us if a drug test could just be done after which one is banned after being caught.  It is a nice theory but we do not have any tools which will physically do this in an intelligent way and I do not think we will have them immediately.  In recent years the mouth swab tests used for cannabis in places such as France and Australia have been problematic.  The new generation of screening kits is much better than those in use at present.  The technology appears to be improving, almost like electronic technology.  In two years time we may have better tools to hand which can do this more accurately.  Everybody - I do not know of any exceptions - believes that impaired driving through legal and illegal drugs is real, and it appears anecdotally to be worsening.  We know it must be contributing to road deaths and we simply must do something about it.  This is an attempt to do something about it which is reasonably intelligent and measured.  It will initially be supported overwhelmingly by the motoring public.  I agree there are concerns.  If we get this wrong, bits of it might fall on challenge.  A concern I have expressed is microtraces proving one used an illicit substance actually triggering a road traffic conviction even though one's road safety was never in question.  We must be very careful about such matters.  There is much we must get right in the regulation.  I suggest it would probably be a far worse sin for the Legislature and the Government to look at this area and say it cannot draft anything because the area is very complicated and choose to do nothing.

This could be by alcohol, illicit medication or prescription medication taken correctly but driving against doctor's advice, by prescription medication self-medicated or taken foolishly, by stuff bought over-the-counter or by fatigue.  One's responsibility before one turns the key is to ensure the car and the driver are in a fit state to take to the road, as per the law and regulations.  This must be an accepted cultural norm.  The legislation is not the last word on this, but it incrementally moves us an inch or two closer to an ideally regulated state, if there could ever be such a thing.  It probably addresses some current anomalies and it is our first proper attempt to address the issue of drugs and driving.  In this context, I suggest it is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015042200002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan"},{"type":"speech","time":1429691400,"counter":1652,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.
