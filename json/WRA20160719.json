The detailed information requested is set out in the following tables.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.  Of the newly attested members, 41 have been assigned to the DMR North Garda Division. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government, &quot;<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commits to<\/font>continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year. We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.<\/p><p>In relation to the fleet, the position is that since 2012 some &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.  This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. <\/p><p><b>Table A<\/b><\/p><p><b>Dublin Metropolitan Region North 31 May 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT<\/th><th>STATION<\/th><th>GDA<\/th><th>SERG<\/th><th>INSP<\/th><th>SUPT<\/th><th>CHIEF<\/th><th>TOTAL<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALBRIGGAN<\/td><td>55<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>68<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>GARRISTOWN<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>LUSK<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALBRIGGAN             <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>SKERRIES<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALBRIGGAN              Total<\/td><td>74<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>89<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALLYMUN<\/td><td>96<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>121<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DUBLIN AIRPORT<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALLYMUN               <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>SANTRY<\/td><td>72<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALLYMUN                Total<\/td><td>186<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>223<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>COOLOCK<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>102<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MALAHIDE<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>4<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>COOLOCK                <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>SWORDS<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>COOLOCK                 Total<\/td><td>169<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>202<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CLONTARF<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>8<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>66<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>HOWTH<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>4<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RAHENY                 <br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/><\/td><td>RAHENY<\/td><td>55<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>66<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>RAHENY                  Total<\/td><td>137<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>160<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH TOTAL <\/td><td><\/td><td>566<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>674<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Table B<\/b><\/p><p><b>Vehicles allocated to the DMR North Division as of 15<\/b><b><sup>th<\/sup><\/b><b>July 2016<\/b><table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>CARS<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MARKED<\/td><td>UNMARKED<\/td><td>VANS<\/td><td>4X4<\/td><td><\/td><td>Others<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALBRIGGAN DISTRICT<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td><\/td><td>0<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALLYMUN DISTRICT<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>COOLOCK DISTRICT<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><td><\/td><td>0<\/td><td>27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RAHENY DISTRICT<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td><\/td><td>0<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>126<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900065#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900065#WRD02850"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[21937\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900065#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of a visa application for a person (details supplied); if she is aware that the processing of this application has taken several months to complete; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In announcing the Programme, the Government recognised the importance of addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  However, as indicated in previous responses to parliamentary questions, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union has been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece.<\/p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece last month to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the overall numbers available to Ireland.  In making this commitment, the Greek authorities also signalled that they will be in a position to include small numbers of unaccompanied minors among the groups being allocated.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to meet the targets foreseen in last September's Government decision and fulfil our commitment to prioritise unaccompanied minors.<\/p>  <p>  I recently chaired a meeting of the high level Task Force established to oversee the implementation of the IRPP during which an approach to taking unaccompanied minors from Greece was discussed. Unaccompanied minors taken in under the relocation strand of the IRPP will be cared for by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which operates under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and has statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis. All aspects of the crisis were most recently discussed at ministerial level at the meeting of EU justice and home affairs Ministers on 7 July last.

That investigation was initiated following complaints made by the family of the young man.  Subsequently, a previous Minister for Justice and Equality, considering that it was desirable in the public interest to do so, referred the matter to GSOC under Section 102 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.

This was the process established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which had been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach, or other public representatives.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  I would like to emphasise that every case under the Independent Review Mechanism was reviewed by independent counsel, who made an objective recommendation. It was open to counsel to make any recommendation that they saw fit, including, if they considered it appropriate, some form of independent inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  Following their review of this case counsel made a recommendation to me, as Minister, on the outcome of that review.

My Department will liaise with other relevant Departments and Agencies as appropriate and it will provide further opportunity for the Deputy and other interested parties to contribute to the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900066#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Co-operation","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900066#WRE02100"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[22101\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900066#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Government has sought for the scope of the Pitchford inquiry into undercover policing by the British state to be extended to cover Ireland, especially given that it is known that at lease one person (details supplied) operated here and visited at least four locations in 2014.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[22102\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900066#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was aware of the undercover activity carried out by a person (details supplied) here; and if so, if it gave permission to the British state for an undercover agent to operate here.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[22103\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900066#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not aware of a person's (details supplied) undercover activity here, if it sought an explanation from its British counterparts as to who instructed the agent to operate here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 to 118, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Undercover Policing Inquiry was established by the UK Authorities in March 2015 to inquire into and report on undercover police operations conducted by English and Welsh police forces in England and Wales.

So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">to<\/font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing. Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the accelerated Garda recruitment programme.<\/p><p><b>Community Police <\/b><table><tr><th>Station<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>*2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Santry<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ballymun<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*31 May 2016<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900067#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900067#WRF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[22572\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900067#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Government will formally recognise Traveller ethnicity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>The issue of Traveller ethnicity is being considered within the context of discussions on the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.

Ceteris paribus, this will reduce the level of royalty imports and as result increase Irish GDP;<\/p>  <p>  -  An increase in new aircraft imports to Ireland for international leasing activities generating substantial fee income without significant employment effects.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that these\u00a0factors do not reflect activity levels we are seeing on the ground.  Although these revisions have significantly boosted investment and net export growth, they do not have a direct bearing on employment and wealth creation for Irish citizens. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that whilst these headline GDP figures have clearly been distorted and are exaggerated in an Irish context, more concrete indicators of the underlying levels of economic activity point to a continuation of a now firmly-rooted recovery.  Specifically, indicators such as consumer spending, tax trends and labour market developments all confirm that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain strong. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to stress that the figures published by the CSO are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.  They measure what they are supposed to measure.  However, in a small, open and very globalised economy such as Ireland, it is clear that relevance of these figures as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed is considerably less than elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Central Statistics Office is to put together a group of experts to provide guidance on how a more relevant indicator could be produced and published alongside these figures in the future.\u00a0\u00a0My Department will\u00a0be\u00a0represented\u00a0on this group.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the exceptional nature of these growth figures I also wish to make clear that the Government will not formulate policy on the basis of these inflated figures.

It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs. \u00a0More information on the SBCI can be found on www.sbci.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.\u00a0 Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund (www.microfinanceireland.ie).<\/p>  <p>  -  The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. \u00a0They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.\u00a0 This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. \u00a0The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.\u00a0 Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the recently published Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.\u00a0 Consequently my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.\u00a0 This work will be particularly important\u00a0in light of the outcome of the\u00a0UK referendum on membership\u00a0of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900068#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":328,"content":"<p>Question No. 156 answered with Question No. 152.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Staff Data","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[21920\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the cost of the National Asset Management Agency's scheme to make retention payments to staff who remain with it; the total amount paid to date; the amount each staff member will be paid; the reason he agreed to the scheme; his views that the payments are justified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[21922\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff employed by the National Asset Management Agency in each of the years 2010 to 2016 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 159 together.<\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy, regarding the cost of NAMA's retention scheme, is set out in aggregate detail in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2015 on page 103.  This is available on the NAMA website, www.nama.ie.\u00a0 NAMA does not make retention payments to staff whilst they remain in its employment.\u00a0 Retention payments are only made where staff are departing the organisation under the Agency's redundancy programme.\u00a0 The retention payment for individual staff is dependent on NAMA achieving its targets and on satisfactory individual performance ratings.  Redundancy dates are pre-agreed with staff as part of NAMA's wind down strategy and payment will only be made when and if the staff member leaves the organisation on the pre-agreed date. <\/p><p>All NAMA officers are employees of the NTMA and are assigned to NAMA by the NTMA.  These staff have a diverse range of skills and experience from the disciplines of banking, finance, law property, insolvency and planning, among others.  The number of staff which are assigned to NAMA by the NTMA is outlined in the Annual Reports and Financial Statements published by the Agency.  This includes 50 employees who exited the Agency as part of the Voluntary Redundancy Programme.<\/p><p>As set out in my Department's Section 227 Review of NAMA in July 2014, the ability of NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State is heavily dependent on its retention of expertise.  That view has been strongly endorsed by the NAMA Board.  Given that, I agreed with the NAMA Board in the context of NAMA's accelerated senior debt redemption target and its ancillary residential and commercial development funding activities, that a redundancy programme reflecting public sector norms and also comprising a retention payment element would be introduced to enable NAMA retain key staff.<\/p><p>Staffing Numbers 2010 - End June 2016<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Staff Numbers<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>103<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>193<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>224<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>331<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>369<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>341<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>End June 2016<\/td><td>303<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Claims Agency","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH00450"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[21921\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount the State Claims Agency paid in legal costs to solicitors representing it and acting for plaintiffs in 2013 to 2015; the top ten payments made to named legal firms representing it and representing plaintiffs in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the NTMA is designated as the State Claims Agency (SCA) when performing the claims management and risk management functions designated to it under the National Treasury Management Acts.<\/p><p>In answer to the Deputy's question I refer to the material provided by the State Claims Agency and which is outlined as follows.

In that regard, Revenue is actively engaging with the OECD Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) Network to agree concrete actions that tax administrations can take in response to this information. <\/p>  <p>  While effective cooperation between countries -\u00a0as reflected in the offshore financial information that the various Automatic Exchange of Information agreements will provide -\u00a0is essential in tackling this worldwide problem, it is both necessary and desirable that domestic legislation governing Revenue powers is kept under constant review to ensure that\u00a0it continues to be fit for purpose.  In that regard, any recommendations from Revenue for increased powers are carefully considered.\u00a0 As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question 10831\/16 of 18 May 2016 discussions are ongoing between my officials and those in Revenue in relation to Revenue powers in the context of the next Finance Bill. <\/p>  <p>  I have also indicated to the Chairman of Revenue that I am committed to supporting any new legislative changes that he feels are needed to tackle tax evasion using offshore structures or accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Vehicle Corporations","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH01750"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[22052\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900069#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if any analysis was carried out by his Department of the tax treatment of vulture funds prior to or after the sale of NAMA and State-owned bank assets to such funds.","asker":"1254","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out a regime for the taxation of special purpose companies set up to securitise assets.\u00a0 The tax provisions are intended to ring-fence the use of section 110 companies for bona-fide securitisation purposes. <\/p>  <p>  The features of the regime are that:-<\/p>  <p>  - The company must be tax resident in Ireland and carry on the business of holding or managing \"qualifying assets\".  \"Qualifying assets\" for Section 110 purposes includes a broad range of financial and other assets including shares, bonds, derivatives, loans, deposits, commodities, plant and machinery and invoices and other types of receivable.<\/p>  <p>  - The value of \"qualifying assets\" must be at least &euro;10Million at the time they are acquired by the Section 110 company.<\/p>  <p>  - Apart from the holding or managing of the \"qualifying assets\" the company cannot carry on any other activities.<\/p>  <p>  The profits or gains of such companies are subject to corporation tax at a rate of 25%.

","asker":"1226","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual.  Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.<\/p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.<\/i>Attorney General (1980).  This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.\u00a0 <\/p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the Constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.  It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.<\/p><p>There would also be legal issues with regard to 'connected persons'.  To counter tax avoidance, 'connected persons' are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts.  The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.  There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits.  However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900070#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vehicle Registration","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900070#WRJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[22193\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900070#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of extending the vehicle registration tax rebate for electric vehicles until 2017 and 2020 respectively.

","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) are part of the flexible options at retirement introduced in Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to the holders of personal pension plans and proprietary director members of occupational pension schemes in relation to the drawdown of their retirement benefits.  Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible retirement lump sum.  These flexible options at retirement have since been extended to the benefits taken by any individual from DC pension arrangements, generally.<\/p>  <p>  An imputed distribution of the value of assets in an ARF was introduced because an internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended to fund an income stream in retirement but was, instead, being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. <\/p>  <p>  In an effort to counteract this, Budget and Finance Act 2006 introduced, with effect from 2007, an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF on 31 December each year (subsequently changed to 30 November each year).  The notional distribution arrangement only applies where the ARF owner is 60 years or over for the whole of a tax year.  The notional distribution was phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% from 2009.  The notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year.  Budget and Finance Act 2011 increased the rate of the notional distribution to 5% of the value of the assets of an ARF, while Finance Act 2012 further increased the rate to 6% in respect of ARFs with values over &euro;2 million.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In Finance Act 2014, however, I reduced the 5% rate to 4% for ARF owners who are under the age of 70 (and where the value of assets in the ARF is &euro;2 million or less).  This reduction in the imputed distribution rate is intended to reduce the risk that individuals in the age group 60 to 70 years might outlive the funds in their ARFs.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0An important point to note is that, while most ARF owners take actual draw downs at least equal to the notional distribution rate, there is no obligation on them to do so.  The requirement in the legislation is not a statutory minimum drawdown condition.  The only requirement is that tax is paid from the ARF on the notional drawdown amount, whether it is drawn down or not. <\/p>  <p>  I do not accept the implied suggestion in the question that the imputed distribution arrangements for ARFs should not apply in order to facilitate financial planning.  We operate what is known as an EET system of pension taxation, whereby contributions to pension arrangements and the build-up of the pension assets in the pension fund are both tax-exempt, while pensions are taxed as income in the pay-out phase.  ARFs, although they are post-retirement investment vehicles and not pension funds per se, nonetheless represent an alternative to the traditional pay-out phase of a taxable annuity for those who choose that option.  Pension fund assets are not taxed on transfer to an ARF.  The ARF benefits from gross roll-up and so it is only right that tax is applied at the point when the ARF owner accesses his or her funds.  As already mentioned, the imputed distribution regime was introduced to encourage ARFs to be used as intended, that is, to provide an ongoing income stream in retirement as a flexible alternative to annuities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900071#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stamp Duty","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900071#WRK01350"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[22437\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900071#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the outstanding measures in the Finance Act 2015 and previous Finance Acts subject to EU approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Activate can provide up to 90% of project funding and will provide funding for both the acquisition of land and to bring projects through the planning process.  Its product is flexible as to term and repayment schedules, thereby enabling alignment with the cashflows of any particular development opportunity.  To date, Activate has provided finance in respect of around 800 residential units and has a promising pipeline of further opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, ISIF is currently exploring supporting the delivery of housing-related enabling infrastructure in large scale priority development areas.  This is in order to kick start the development process, provided such financing can be done on the basis of appropriate risk and commercial return for the risks taken.  Proposals will be assessed on a project by project basis.  ISIF's flexible approach to funding and ability to look at potential longer timeframes means it can play a role that is not suited to more traditional debt providers or developer equity.

Where\u00a0the Central Bank is of the\u00a0view that the state of the ICF is such that financial support should be provided for it, it is allowed to determine an appropriate contribution to be paid to the ICF by each insurer.  This is calculated as a percentage determined by the Central Bank, not exceeding 2 per cent of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to the insurer or insurer authorised in another\u00a0Member State in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in Ireland.  If\u00a0the Central Bank envisages a deficit may exist in the fund\u00a0at any time in the calendar year after the contributions received from each insurer, it\u00a0may recommend to me, as Minister for Finance, to advance funds to the ICF from\u00a0the central fund.

Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.  There is no facility under the Stability and Growth Pact to allow for a derogation to borrow outside the fiscal rules.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to note that there are\u00a0existing provisions in the fiscal rules that are designed to promote public investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the rules, public investment is granted favourable treatment -\u00a0as a result of four-year capital\u00a0smoothing, only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the\u00a0fiscal space.  This provision means capital spending for housing and other purposes can be leveraged within the EU rules.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, in line with the European Commission approach, the Government adopted a slightly less stringent medium-term budgetary objective (MTO)\u00a0of a structural deficit amounting to 0.5 per cent\u00a0of GDP in the Summer Economic Statement (SES) which was published in June.  As I have already communicated, this policy initiative will result in an additional &euro;1&frac12; billion in\u00a0fiscal space\u00a0becoming available under the EU rules once the MTO is reached.  Taking account of this development and capital smoothing we will, as set out in the SES, be bringing forward proposals for an additional cumulative &euro;4 billion in capital formation over the period 2017 - 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the fiscal rules provide for certain flexibilities, particularly with a view\u00a0to encouraging public investment.  Specifically the rules allow for temporary deviations from\u00a0the required structural\u00a0budgetary adjustment if spending on\u00a0capital investment can be shown to qualify for either the investment clause\u00a0or the structural reform clause.  Both of these provisions are subject to strict conditions; and while\u00a0Ireland has not\u00a0yet been in a position to apply given where we are in the business cycle, the situation is kept under constant\u00a0review.<\/p>  <p>  I would point out that we are continually exploring how permitted flexibility within the existing framework can be optimised\u00a0as well as\u00a0seeking to improve the implementation of the SGP.  For instance, a number of proposals from Ireland to improve the application of the fiscal rules were adopted by the Commission last year.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that ending the Housing shortage\u00a0and Homelessness is a priority for this Government.

While a small number of these staff remain in schools, the schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant scheme.  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for caretaking, secretarial or cleaning services.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how such services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a caretaker, secretary or a cleaner, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process if necessary.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Arbitrator's recommendations were accepted by both sides.  My Department issued Circulars to schools which gave effect to the measures which applied from 1 January 2016 (i.e. an increase of 2.5% in the hourly pay rate and the introduction of a minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25) to School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and also revised grant rates.

This report outlines the continued progress that has been made, particularly with regard to developments in: curriculum; teacher education policy; Irish-medium education and Gaeltacht education. <\/p><p>Work is currently underway in my Department to finalise policy proposals for Gaeltacht education in light of the outcomes of a consultation process.  Consideration is being given to various options and potential actions that will be most beneficial for the regeneration and survival of the Irish language and of the role Gaeltacht education has to play in this.  The document needs to be discussed by me with my Cabinet colleagues.  Proposals in the document are also being discussed as part of the estimates process for the forthcoming budget.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to monitor on-going progress in the implementation of the 20 Year Strategy and, in collaboration with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, will continue to support and promote best practice with regard to the Irish Language not only in Gaeltacht areas but also throughout the education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900076#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900076#WRP03500"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[22407\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900076#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the sections of the EPSEN Act that have not been commenced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>A number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children. <\/p><p>The following sections of EPSEN were commenced in 2005.<\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council<\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.

The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2016\/2017 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0035\/2016 which issued on 20 May 2016 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0035\/2016 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectorial, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. It does not work on a list basis. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.<\/p><p>It is important to note that when an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in Circular 0035\/2016.

These changes were incorporated into the Teaching Council's Policy Paper on the Continuum of Teacher Education, which set the criteria for providers of initial teacher education.<\/p><p>The position is that, since the end of the 2012\/13 school year, the Supplementary Special National Panel is being phased out and no new applications are being accepted. This decision by my Department reflects the wider availability of primary teachers who are qualified to work in all settings, which was not the case when this panel was originally set up.<\/p><p>Since 2012, the Teaching Council has responsibility for determining policy, procedures and criteria for the induction and probation of newly qualified teachers.

All local authorities completed and returned their individual reports, which will be collated in the National Report.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the project, a collaborative approach, which incorporated the concerns, views, advice and knowledge of Travellers and Traveller Organisations was adopted, working together in a National Steering Group with fire safety professionals in the local authority fire service and staff in local authority housing departments.<\/p>  <p>  The report will provide relevant back ground information and describe the methodology adopted for the task of auditing local authority provided Traveller accommodation against appropriate fire safety benchmarks which were set out in the Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation.  This review process has focussed on the fire safety measures which are perceived to be the most effective in protecting life safety among the Traveller community.  Three specific issues were identified from an early stage:<\/p>  <p>- The absence of smoke alarms which would alert sleeping families to the dangers of fire at an early stage and enable them to evacuate quickly;<\/p>  <p>- The danger posed in multi-unit accommodation by the layout of units where a fire in one could prevent people from another unit escaping to safety;<\/p>  <p>- The dangers of fire (and electrocution) posed by inappropriate extension of electrical connections between units.<\/p>  <p>  The report will describe the extent to which the process has seen improvement works carried out to address the above key issues and a range of other fire safety factors.  In addition to the physical works, the report will describe a parallel programme of &ldquo;community fire safety&rdquo; which has been undertaken incorporating training for key workers and engagement with community groups on fire safety awareness.

My Department&rsquo;s funding is to support the authorities in tackling those houses that may require a greater level of remediation than the normal level of pre-letting repairs that is the responsibility of local authorities, as part of their ongoing repair and maintenance of local authority housing.<\/p><p>The funding from my Department has a particular focus on returning homes to productive use in a highly energy efficient condition, which contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s targets to reduce carbon emissions and helps tackle fuel poverty.  In that regard, my Department has not imposed a cap of &euro;30,000 for the refurbishment of vacant local authority units; rather, that is the maximum funding my Department provides per unit in supporting local authorities to prepare such units for re-letting in an energy efficient condition.  It should be noted that local authorities can and do contribute additional funding where appropriate.<\/p><p>Between 2014 and 2015, my Department provided funding of &euro;60 million to assist local authorities in returning 5,000 vacant units to productive use, with a further &euro;24 million being allocated to date in 2016.  The programme will support the remediation of over 6,500 units between 2014 and 2016, on top of units completed by the local authorities themselves outside of the funding support from my Department.<\/p><p>The funding support drawn down per unit from my Department by local authorities is an average of &euro;18,000.  This reflects the fact that, as would be expected, the remediation cost ranges widely and the majority of houses require only a modest level of remediation.  In recognition of the limited cases where a high level of remediation is required, my Department is also providing Exchequer funding to support local authorities in tackling more seriously derelict social houses.  This programme is now underway and I expect that the average cost per unit will be somewhat above &euro;50,000 per unit.<\/p><p>Between the various funding supports available from my Department, alongside the efforts of local authorities themselves, I am satisfied that local authorities are in a position to ensure that all social housing units for which there is a housing need can be returned to use. <\/p><p>In a limited number of cases under the programme to tackle vacant units, clarification is sought where required from local authorities on issues such as housing need, while there is also a small number of cases where the very low level of pre-letting repairs made it more appropriate to deal with the unit under normal local authority pre-letting repairs as part of their repair and maintenance work.  Arising from this, while all units proposed for remediation under the 2015 programme have been funded, it is likely that two low cost units will not be funded by my Department in 2016 - in Donegal and in Tipperary - as it is more appropriate to deal with them under normal local authority pre-letting repairs.  The number of units supported under the programme to tackle vacant units in 2015 and the numbers sanctioned to date for 2016 are set out in the following table. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s new housing action plan, the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness which I launched today, includes commitments in respect of the better management of social housing stock, in line with best asset management practices, so that the re-letting of vacant social housing units is achieved with minimal delay.<table><tr><th><\/th><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>Units Completed in 2015<\/th><th>Units Approved for 2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Carlow<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Cavan<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Clare<\/td><td>96<\/td><td>27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Cork City<\/td><td>281<\/td><td>115<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Cork County<\/td><td>199<\/td><td>69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown <\/td><td>24<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>146<\/td><td>65<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>787<\/td><td>339<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Fingal<\/td><td>139<\/td><td>137<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Galway City<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Galway County<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Kerry <\/td><td>103<\/td><td>56<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Kildare<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Laois<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Limerick<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Longford<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Louth<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Mayo<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21<\/td><td>Meath<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>22<\/td><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>23<\/td><td>Offaly<\/td><td>55<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>24<\/td><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>65<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>25<\/td><td>Sligo<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>26<\/td><td>South Dublin<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>27<\/td><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>115<\/td><td>71<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>28<\/td><td>Waterford <\/td><td>56<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>29<\/td><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>74<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30<\/td><td>Wexford<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>31<\/td><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Totals<\/td><td>2,696<\/td><td>1,302<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900083#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Ministerial Council","counter":972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900083#WRW01450"},{"type":"question","counter":973,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[22859\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900083#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the date for the next meeting with the Northern Ireland Minister for the Environment in sectoral format, as provided for in the North-South Ministerial Council; the issues to be discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":974,"content":"<p>The next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council (Environment Sector) is scheduled to take place on 14 September 2016.<\/p>  <p>  While the agenda for the forthcoming meeting has not yet been agreed, recent meetings enabled us to address common challenges in a mutually beneficial way through enhanced co-operation and joint action on a range of environmental issues.

Professionals in possession of qualifications as listed in Annex V of the Directive are eligible for automatic recognition in other Member States.  Annex V comprises the qualifications that meet the stated minimum training conditions necessary for inclusion in the automatic recognition system.  In Ireland, the competent authority for the registration of architects is the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), who register the persons who fulfil the competencies set out in the Directive with the MRIAI qualification.  As MRIAI is listed in Annex V, architects who hold the MRIAI qualification are eligible for automatic recognition in other Member States.  While a professional may obtain automatic recognition, further authorisation or registration requirements may need to be fulfilled prior to being able to practice in other Member States.<\/p>  <p>  For architects whose qualifications may not be listed in Annex V and are not eligible for automatic recognition, recognition may be sought under the general system.  Under the general system, a professional can submit their qualifications for recognition to the relevant competent authority, in the Member State in which they intend to practice, who will in turn complete an assessment and reach a decision in accordance with the terms of the Directive.  Architects who hold the MRIAI (IRL) qualification fall into this category.  These comprise of architects who have demonstrated that they meet the requirements for registration in the State as set out in Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007, having qualified through a number of special entry routes available, or previously available, in Ireland (e.g. the Minister&rsquo;s List, the Technical Assessment Procedure or the Prescribed Register Admissions Examination).

Levels of abuse of the scheme by employers were very low.

The disability and illness related schemes require a high level of medical evidence which must be assessed by the Medical Assessors and this, together with other qualifying criteria such as means testing, can affect the processing times of claims.  My Department continues to engage with general practitioners and others to clarify the medical requirements of our schemes so that adequate information may be provided with the initial claim.<\/p><p>This increases the likelihood of an eligible initial decision and therefore reduces the need for further evidence to be submitted for review at a later stage.<\/p><p>My Department has 27 Medical Assessors (MAs) including the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer (DCMO).  Due to work-sharing, the full-time equivalent number of Medical Assessors currently serving is 23.5 including the Chief Medical Officer and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. The delay in processing medical assessments is due to a number of factors including the increase in volume of customer claims to particular schemes and the time involved in assessing cases where there is lengthy medical evidence to be considered.  Current Medical Assessor resources are focused on ensuring that claims for the various disability and illness schemes are prioritised above other work until the backlog is eliminated.<\/p><p>My Department is also addressing the issue by ensuring that there are sufficient Medical Assessors available to provide a quality customer service. The Department has engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D\/PER) and completed a recruitment competition through the Public Appointment Service (PAS) for the recruitment of new Medical Assessors.  Appointments from this competition and from the previous panel are being offered at the moment.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement. Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances. <\/p><p>The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Homemaker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; and the passage of time means that the potential cost now would be significantly higher.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of<i>paid<\/i>contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012. <\/p><p>Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p><p>It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. <\/p><p>Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of women who were home-makers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance Scheme Applications","counter":1014,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1015,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[22019\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress to date in determination of an application by a person (details supplied) for a back-to-school allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1016,"content":"<p>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the costs of clothing and footwear when children return to school each autumn.

In particular, the Department of Social Protection is mindful of its responsibility to uphold the legal structure within which companies operate.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials from the Department are continuing to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the situation of informal insolvency.  I am not in a position to indicate at this stage how or when this will be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the current state of play for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1020,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1021,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[22046\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the State funding provided by his Department and agencies under its remit to non-profit or non-governmental organisations for each year from 2008 to 2015.","asker":"1254","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":1022,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[22047\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the State funding provided by his Department and agencies under its remit to faith-based non-profit organisations for each year from 2008 to 2015.","asker":"1254","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1023,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 404 and 405 together.<\/p><p>The information requested is currently being examined within my Department and will be made available to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":1024,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1025,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[22106\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900084#WRX03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of a disability allowance application by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1026,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the Department is in receipt of an application for disability allowance (DA) from the above named person.

Currently, to qualify for a State pension (contributory), a person must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions which include commencing insurable employment at least 10 years before pension age, having a minimum of 520 qualifying PRSI contributions and achieving a yearly average of at least 10 qualifying contributions, paid or credited, over their working life.  <\/p><p>Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6 April 1988.

In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self-employed social insurance was introduced in 1988, who had not paid other contributions (such as voluntary contributions, or other contributions while in employment), and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age.

It is designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace. <\/p>  <p>  JobPath is a new approach to employment activation that supports people who are long-term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market to secure and sustain full-time paid employment.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  They spend a year on JobPath and if they are placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the person concerned is aged 61 years and has already completed 6 years on a Community Employment (CE) scheme. Under current CE rules, a person over 55 years of age is limited to a maximum period of 6 years on the scheme. The person concerned is currently not eligible to participate on a CE scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned was referred to JobPath on 21 June 2016. He attended a meeting with his personal adviser and agreed a personal progression plan on 30 June 2016. He will reach the age of 62 later this year. When a jobseeker is selected for any activation programme and reaches 62 years of age while on the programme they are expected to complete the programme.  <\/p>  <p>  A CE pilot initiative called the Service Support Stream was introduced in December 2015 to enable those aged 62 and over to extend their participation on CE beyond the standard maximum participation limits provided the eligibility conditions are met.  Participants aged 62 and over, are allowed to participate on CE on a continuous basis up to the state pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the department.  The total number of places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme is limited to 7% of each scheme&rsquo;s overall budgeted places. The limitation on such places per scheme is in place to maintain the overall throughput on the programme.  The participation limit is set to allow for the highest utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons and aims to ensure the benefit of these schemes are available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.  <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned may be considered for the CE Service Support Stream initiative after he has completed 52 weeks on JobPath and provided he is still in receipt of a CE-qualifying social welfare payment for the requisite period of time.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme, than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory, whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years.  Provided a person satisfies all the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30.<\/p>  <p>  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for such periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the yearly average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.

I do not accept the contention that serious human rights&rsquo; abuses are a direct result of the EU's efforts to stem migration from Libya.  The current political situation in Libya, with the absence of a functioning government, and the existence of a large number of irregular military groups has created the conditions where people are particularly vulnerable to breaches of their human rights.  Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in Libya are focused on working with our EU partners and the UN in supporting the formation of a functioning government which will be in a better position to protect the rights of both Libyan citizens and foreign nationals.  In addition, there are several ongoing European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) programmes in Libya targeted towards protecting vulnerable people, including migrants.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Sophia is working to prevent this loss of life at sea by disrupting the business model of people smugglers and traffickers who exploit vulnerable people for profit and place their lives at risk.  The Mission is one element of the comprehensive approach being pursued by the EU to address the migration crisis.  It is being conducted in strict accordance with international law and participating vessels must be ready and equipped to perform search and rescue tasks.  To date, the mission has rescued over 19,000 people.  Ireland has not, to date, participated in the Mission and there are currently no plans to do so.  Separately, over the past year, Ireland has assisted the Italian authorities on a bilateral basis in humanitarian search and rescue operations to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.  Almost 10,000 migrants have been rescued by Irish naval vessels operating in the Mediterranean since they commenced their deployments in May 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In May, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to extend Operation Sophia&rsquo;s mandate until July 2017.  It also agreed to broaden the mandate by adding two supporting tasks: training of the Libyan Coastguard and Navy; and implementation of the UN arms embargo based on a new UN Security Council Resolution, UNSCR 2292.  This resolution was adopted on 14 June 2016 and now underpins the arms embargo task.  When fully implemented, these measures will help towards restoring a level of stability, and assist in the building of a more effective political entity where human rights abuses are less likely to occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900089#WRCC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Data","counter":1257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900089#WRCC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1258,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[22574\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900089#WRCC01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the Passport Office can confirm that the details pertaining to the passports of persons (details supplied) were used illegally by a third party elsewhere in Europe; if the United States authorities referred this matter to the Passport Office as the passport holders were denied a visa to visit the United States of America on the basis of the attempted illegal use of this passport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1259,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the case to which the Deputy refers is subject to investigation, including by my Department.

The review was undertaken by an Inter-Departmental Review Group, led by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW).  The Review Group prepared a report that was put to Government, and subsequently approved and published in September 2004.<\/p><p>The scope of the review included a review of the roles and responsibilities of the different bodies with responsibilities for managing flood risk, and to set a new policy for flood risk management in Ireland into the future.<\/p><p>Three specific recommendations of the Report, led to the development and implementation of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  These were:<\/p><p>-  Focus on managing flood risk, rather than relying only on flood protection measures aimed at reducing flooding.<\/p><p>-  Taking a catchment-based approach to assess and manage risks within the whole-catchment context.<\/p><p>-  Being proactive in assessing and managing flood risks, including the preparation of flood maps and flood risk management plans. <\/p><p>In 2005, a Plan for the implementation of the new policy was developed by the OPW, and this included the proposed approach for developing and implementing what became the National CFRAM Programme.  This Programme would be a major undertaking that is new within Ireland, and so it was hence decided that pilot projects should be undertaken to develop and test the process before rolling the Programme out at a larger scale.  It was intended that pilot testing might be undertaken over a range of catchments to develop an understanding of the different issues that might arise in catchments of different characters (as influenced by factors such as size, degree of urbanisation and availability of data).  The selection of pilot catchments was however primarily governed by data availability, the pro-activeness of Local Authorities and prioritisation based on the existing degree of potential risk and the pressure for future development<\/p><p>The Implementation Plan identified nine candidate communities or catchments as possible pilot CFRAM projects.  Four pilots were eventually progressed, which were:<\/p><p>-  The Lee CFRAM Pilot Project, which included large urban areas of high risk (i.e., Cork City), as well as a number of smaller towns and villages potentially ay risk, with flooding occurring from both the rivers and the sea.  This catchment hence included priority areas of assessment (i.e., Cork City) as well as a diverse range of factors that would enable robust testing of the CFRAM process.<\/p><p>-  The Dodder CFRAM Pilot Project, which included significant urban areas within Dublin that had previously experienced severe flooding, and hence was a priority area of assessment.<\/p><p>-  The Fingal - East Meath Pilot CFRAM Project where there was significant pressure for development leading to the relevant councils proactively seeking flood risk assessments to inform sustainable development.<\/p><p>-  The Suir CFRAM Project, where previous work had been done, and which was deemed suitable to be undertaken in-house to build the technical expertise to enable OPW staff to critically assess and work with the CFRAM outputs, noting the OPW&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain and review the Plans.<\/p><p>Of the remaining candidates projects, it might be noted that:<\/p><p>-  two candidate rivers\/catchments were integrated to form part of the scope of the Fingal - East Meath Pilot CFRAM Programme,<\/p><p>-  flood risk assessments and\/or the development of flood risk management measures were taken forward for two candidate communities through other projects, and,<\/p><p>-  major schemes were progressing to address the principal areas of risk in two other candidate catchments.<\/p><p>The first of the Pilot CFRAM Studies (the Lee Pilot CFRAM Study) commenced mid-2006, and the Dodder Pilot CFRAM Study and then Suir Projects then commenced shortly thereafter.  The Fingal-East Meath Pilot CFRAM (the FEM-FRAM) Study began in 2008 following a request from Fingal County Council.

The production of these additional maps has placed increased resource demands on the consultants undertaking the CFRAM Projects. <\/p>  <p>  Examples of additional mapping includes:<\/p>  <p>  -  Preparation of flood maps for two potential future scenarios reflecting the potential impacts of climate change - This will permit the consideration of potential future adaptation requirements into the flood risk management planning process, and can also inform spatial planning and development management decision-making.<\/p>  <p>  -  Preparation of flood maps for eight flood event magnitudes\/probabilities, where the Directive requires only two - This provides a significantly better understanding of flood risk, and can inform emergency response given the detailed understanding as to how a flood can develop and evolve.<\/p>  <p>  -  Flood Zone maps, which are not a requirement of the Directive - These maps correspond to the Flood Zones defined in the Guidelines on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management (DECLG\/OPW, 2009), hence directly supporting sustainable planning and development, and the avoidance of building in floodplains.<\/p>  <p>  In total, the OPW is producing approximately 40,000 flood maps through the National CFRAM Programme, of which only approximately 13,000 are required under the EU 'Floods' Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900091#WREE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Expenditure","counter":1337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900091#WREE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1338,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[22307\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900091#WREE01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount which has been spent on flood relief schemes here from 2004 to date, broken down by county and by year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":1339,"content":"<p>Expenditure by the Office of Public Works in the period 2004 to the end of June 2016 on flood relief activities and measures amounts to approximately &euro;402 million, of which  &euro;292 million relates to expenditure on major flood relief schemes.

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2014, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Insurance Ireland (II), the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland, and the Office of Public Works (OPW).  This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans for transfer of information from the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme to the insurance industry.  Under this Programme which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the Office of Public Works (OPW) working in partnership with the local authorities, detailed draft flood maps have been produced for 300 communities at potentially significant risk from flooding.  The insurance sector was informed that the draft flood maps cannot be relied upon to inform insurance premiums, policies or excesses.  The maps are now being finalised following completion of a statutory public consultation, and finalised maps are being published together with draft Flood Risk Management Plans.  Access to the finalised maps is subject to acknowledgement and acceptance that the maps may not be used for any commercial, business, professional or other income generating activity.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in January of this year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 89%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 78%.<\/p>  <p>  II has pointed out that the effective operation of demountable flood defences requires accurate forecasting systems and methods, flood alert systems and monitoring, efficient mobilisation of equipment, manpower and materials and the timely and correct operation of the demountable defences.

The &quot;<i>Updated Business Case for<\/i><i>Restoring the Ulster Canal from Lough Erne to Clones&quot; <\/i>and the<i>&quot;Cost Benefit Analysis of the National Gallery Redevelopment Project&quot;<\/i>were published in 2015.  The remaining reports have not been published and publication of these reports will be considered on case by case basis.<\/p><p>For completeness, I wish to provide information to the Deputy in relation to three reports commissioned by other Departments in relation to matters that are now the responsibility of my Department.  The University of Birmingham was commissioned in 2010 by the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to undertake a review relating to peatlands. The resulting report, &quot;<i>Review of Archaeological Survey and Mitigation Policy relating to Bord na M&oacute;na Peatlands<\/i>&quot; was published in June 2013 and the associated costs of &euro;34,337 were met by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p>In 2015, the then Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government commissioned a Review of Comhairle na Tuaithe and the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy.  This report was completed by ILC Sports and Recreation at a cost of &euro;15,341.  The final report was received earlier this year but has not yet been published.<\/p><p>Finally, the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published the Final Report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group in January 2016.  This report was completed by Warrenbay Limited at a cost of &euro;32,540.<\/p><p><b>Reports commissioned by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht<\/b><table><tr><th>Year Commissioned <\/th><th>Company<\/th><th>Title of Report<\/th><th>Cost <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>Avia Solutions<\/td><td>Review of financial submissions relating to the Public Service Obligation Air Service for the Aran Islands<\/td><td>&euro;6,300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Bonnar Keenlyside<\/td><td>Review of Dublin Contemporary 2011<\/td><td>&euro;10,959<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Dorgan Associates<\/td><td>Cost Benefit Analysis of National Archives Development Plan<\/td><td>&euro;12,669<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Dorgan Associates<\/td><td>Cost Benefit Analysis of National Gallery Redevelopment Project<\/td><td>&euro;12,731<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013\/2014<\/td><td>Dorgan Associates<\/td><td>Examination of capital incentives to promote investment in film studio infrastructure<\/td><td>&euro;6,765<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>EY<\/td><td>Review of PSO Air Service for the Aran Islands<\/td><td>&euro;41,795<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>Fitzpatrick Associates<\/td><td>Updated Business Case Restoring the Ulster Canal from Lough Erne to Clones<\/td><td>&euro;15,191<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>The VAT Practice<\/td><td>Advisory service on UK VAT<\/td><td>&euro;

Once adopted by the Commission, these sites are known as candidate special areas of conservation in Ireland.  Legal protections, commensurate with those set out in the EU Habitats Directive, apply to the sites since initially proposed for designation and Ireland&rsquo;s planning and environmental legislation takes the proposed designations into account.  The additional technical steps to formal designation do not affect the legal protection of a site.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has 430 areas identified for designation as special areas of conservation.  Most of these were proposed for designation between 1997 and 2005, with some more recent additions in the marine environment. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Habitats Directive, formal designation must be completed within 6 years of a candidate special area of conservation being adopted by the European Commission.  With the 6 year period passed for most of the sites in question, the Commission opened an infringement case against Ireland in February 2015. The case is understood to be a horizontal action with proceedings also issued against a number of other Member States. <\/p>  <p>  A project has been put in place within my Department to oversee formal designation of all special areas of conservation.  This has involved a significant amount of scientific work to ensure that boundaries of sites are cleared of appeals and finalised for designation, and updating the mapping format used to provide the most accurate and user friendly information to all parties, particularly landowners. <\/p>  <p>  The final phase of formal designation involves the signing of a Statutory Instrument for each special area of conservation.  That process began earlier this year and some 86 special areas of conservation have now been designated by Statutory Instrument.  Work is continuing with the aim of formally designating all remaining special areas of conservation as early as possible.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no explicit obligation under the Habitats Directive to develop site specific conservation objectives, these are being produced by my Department in order to define the conditions to be achieved by species and habitat types within the respective sites which will in turn maximize the contribution of the sites to achieving favourable conservation status at various levels.  These site specific conservation objectives continue to be developed on a prioritised basis, with some 129 published to date in relation to special areas of conservation. <\/p>  <p>  A strategy for the establishment and improved coordination and delivery of conservation measures at site level has been recently developed.  A detailed structure and enhanced programme of work will be put in place with the aim of developing and implementing conservation measures.  This will be a significant programme of work, but one that has the potential to ensure the protection and restoration of species and habitats.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model, called the Better Starts Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) provides supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33 from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll out of the new inclusive pre-schools model.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  When introducing AIM, there was specific emphasis on the fact that all existing supports, should remain in place until the new model is fully embedded in the system.  This approach was agreed by the three Government Departments involved in the development of the model and remains the policy position.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days he should contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900093#WRGG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900093#WRGG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[22315\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900093#WRGG04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views regarding the pensions that employers of an organisation (details supplied) receive.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1452,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[21948\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900093#WRGG04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the efforts he is making to ensure that all employees of the Central Remedial Clinic receive adequate pensions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1453,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[22368\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900093#WRGG04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware of the fact that a decision on certain CRC staff members' inclusion in the State SPSPS is due to be made within the next few weeks; if he will ensure that the affected staff are included in the SPSPS; if this decision will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1454,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[22370\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900093#WRGG04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to sanction the inclusion of the CRC workers into the SPSPS with equivalent benefits; when this decision will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1455,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 554, 563, 642 and 643 together.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the 44 employees of the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) who were members of a funded DB scheme, I am aware that the HSE is currently examining a submission which has been provided by the CRC.

The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.  It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care, all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services to provide an optimal configuration of trauma services.  The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.

It is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services.  There are currently no plans to close or remove trauma services from any hospital.<\/p>  <p>  A trauma patient needs access to the best service that has the right resources to match their often multiple and critical needs in the shortest time possible.  The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.  It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care, all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services to provide an optimal configuration of trauma services.  The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.  The RCSI (the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists) also called for its establishment at their annual scientific meeting last year.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a National Steering Group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland.  This is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE, developed in recognition that we do not have a coordinated trauma network structure in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Group has been working with the Department of Health, the HSE and all relevant HSE National Clinical Leads, including Surgery, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care, Critical Care,  Orthopaedics and Trauma on the development of the policy.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  In 2009, NIAC recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls, and in September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of second level schools.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction . <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland and is the appropriate authority to which possible adverse reactions to medicinal products should be reported.  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.

Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll out of the new inclusive pre-schools model.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  When introducing AIM, there was specific emphasis on the fact that all existing supports, should remain in place until the new model is fully embedded in the system.  This approach was agreed by the three Government Departments involved in the development of the model and remains the policy position.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.

The strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth, part of which is the development of an electronic health record (EHR) programme.  The Office of the Chief Information Officer in the HSE has recently submitted a detailed business case for the programme.  My Department is currently evaluating how this might be progressed particularly in delivering an EHR in the context of the work being planned for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital which aspires to be the first digital hospital facility in the country. In developing a national electronic health record programme we must build on the progress to date in ICT deployment but also on the lessons learnt from other jurisdictions in developing an optimum solution for Ireland.  This programme, if progressed, will require a substantial investment in healthcare ICT.  It also offers the opportunity for a more patient centred and a more integrated approach along with significant efficiencies.  The business case highlights a number of optional timescales and investment approaches which will need to be considered.  The scale of the task in implementing an electronic health record programme is very large and requires a complex procurement and approval process.  It is a five to ten year programme of work depending on the scale of resources deployed.  <\/p><p>Two current legislative initiatives will help support the EHR - the Health Identifiers Act, 2014 is providing a legal basis for a system of identifiers in the health sector and the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, currently being drafted, includes provisions for the making of standards to support interoperability of health care computer systems.  An EHR implementation will however require a robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data and must be consistent with the new EU data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016\/679.  My Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support eHealth and the deployment of electronic health records in the future.  The health care delivery system straddles both the public and private domains and requires an information governance environment to ensure the right information about the right patient is available securely, in the right place and at the right time.  A critically important aspect in the deployment of an EHR is the empowerment of patients to access and partake in managing their own data.  In developing new information structures to support health care, substantial engagement with patients and the public will be required along with other stakeholders such as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioners and the Health Information and Quality Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900097#WRLL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Data","counter":1626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900097#WRLL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1627,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[22259\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900097#WRLL03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of people here suffering from coeliac disease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1628,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.<\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases.  Lyme borreliosis is notifiable in Ireland since 2012; the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form of LB: Lyme neuroborreliosis.  <\/p><p>The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows: <\/p><p>- 2012 &ndash; 8 cases; <\/p><p>- 2013 &ndash; 13 cases; <\/p><p>- 2014 &ndash; 18 cases; <\/p><p>- 2015 &ndash; 12 cases.<\/p><p>This gives an average annual incidence rate of neuroborreliosis in Ireland of about 2.7 neuroborreliosis cases per million population. <\/p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease.  The week beginning May 2 was designated as Lyme Awareness Week this year. <\/p><p>The literature on the HPSC website points out that that campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to ticks (and therefore LB).  That said, anyone walking or hiking in the countryside is at risk of biting ticks.  The ticks responsible for LB are generally hard-bodied ticks (Ixodidae).  Ixodes ticks are hosted by a wide range of mammals including deer, sheep and cows, and occasionally birds; their tiny size (less than 2mm unfed) means they can remain undetected for long periods.<\/p><p>Ixodes ticks are most likely to be found in:  <\/p><p>-  Shady and humid woodland clearings with grass; <\/p><p>-  Open grassland, walking paths (especially those bordered by long grasses); <\/p><p>-  Wooded and forested areas; <\/p><p>-  Vegetation close to lakes and seaside beaches; <\/p><p>-  Parkland areas; and <\/p><p>-  Open fields and bushes.<\/p><p>They are present in both urban and rural environments and are active from spring to autumn. Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week.<\/p><p>The HPSC emphasise that prevention of tick bites is the most effective way to prevent LB and a comprehensive amount of which will enable the public to:  <\/p><p>-  Identify likely areas of tick infestation; <\/p><p>-  Habits to develop to prevent tick biting them and their families; and <\/p><p>-  Habits to develop to examine oneself (and one&rsquo;s children and pets) to remove any ticks they discover after a day in the country.<\/p><p>In addition, a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900098#WRMM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":1669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900098#WRMM01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1670,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[22283\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900098#WRMM02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be facilitated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1671,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

Exports in 2015 recorded double digit growth to reach &euro;410 million.  In volume terms exports are likely to increase from 7 million cases in 2014 to 12 million cases by 2020 and 24 million cases by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  Significant investment has taken place since 2011 in expansion of existing facilities and development of new distilleries.  However, release of additional capacity on to the market will take time as whiskey must, under EU and Irish law, be matured in wood for at least three years.  So the product of distillations in 2016 and 2017 will come on the market close to 2020. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the Compecon report by Dr. Pat Massey which concluded that the lack of a wholesale market in Irish Whiskey and the ageing requirement are barriers to expansion. <\/p>  <p>  The recommendation on developing a wholesale whiskey market to facilitate the development of Irish Whiskey brands by businesses which do not themselves have distilling capacity is interesting and is also suggested in the industry Vision for Irish Whiskey.  I would welcome initiatives to facilitate the development of such a market but do not have the power to compel individual distilling companies to set aside part of their production for a wholesale market. <\/p>  <p>  Establishing an un-aged Irish Whiskey category is, however, ruled out by Regulation (EC) No 110\/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which applies both to product placed on the market in the Community and that produced in the Community for export.  The Regulation defines the Whiskey category in some detail, including a requirement that the final distillate be matured for at least three years in wooden casks.  Product which has not been matured for this period may not be described as Whiskey or retain the EU geographical indication status accorded to Irish Whiskey, which is one of the geographical indications included in a number of bilateral trade agreements between the EU and third countries.  At national level, the Irish Whiskey Act, 1980 requires that Irish Whiskey be matured in wooden casks for at least three years in warehouses in the State and\/or Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to explore with the industry and development agencies ways of developing and showcasing the portfolio of Irish Whiskey brands to promote awareness of Irish Whiskey in international markets and to contribute to the export and development goals of FoodWise 2025. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900102#WRQQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":1868,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900102#WRQQ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1869,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[22152\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900102#WRQQ02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the Irish greyhounds board tote; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1870,"content":"<p>Bord na gCon has informed me that it will be reporting a 6.5% increase in Tote operating profits for the six months to 30 June 2016 when compared to the first six months in 2015.<\/p><p>I understand from Bord na gCon that this improved profitability is as a result of Bord na gCon securing a number of contracts during the latter part of 2015.

An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.<\/p><p>While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, the European Commission has advised that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS. Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible. If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible.<\/p><p>From an Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) perspective the area must initially be designated and subsequently must be available for agricultural purposes in the same way as is required for BPS. Participants in AEOS must continue to deliver the actions that they have included in their contract with the Department for the full duration of that contract. Anything that would affect the delivery of such actions in their entirety could have negative consequences for their AEOS payments, depending on the individual circumstances.<\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has informed me that before a final decision is taken on introducing a new support scheme - which may include support for solar PV -\u00a0that Department will run a public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to participate in the development of the scheme.\u00a0Details of the next public consultation will be advertised on their website <\/font><i><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">www.dcenr.gov.ie<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">.

However I have no role in the setting of prices as is the case for any Agriculture Minister in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  A prolonged period of volatility in dairy markets has been in evidence in recent times.  However it is important to remember that the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  How we mitigate the current volatility is the challenge. \u00a0Volatility in dairy markets is a global problem, an EU problem and an Irish problem for which there is no single silver bullet.  Fixed price and margin contracts, futures markets and access to increasingly flexible forms of credits are all part of the toolkit that will be required.  In this respect we must continue to work with industry and the financial services sector at a national level to ensure resilience is built into the sector in the current period of volatility and going forward, strengthening our position within the global market.<\/p>  <p>  I am anxious that we must focus on other support measures that can play a role in supporting the sector and it is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.  The Commission has already deployed a range of market supports including intervention and Aids to Private Storage, and provided a financial package of &euro;500 million for liquidity assistance was agreed at the Agriculture council in September 2016.  At yesterday&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers, the Commission announced a further &euro;500m support package for EU farmers.  This is to be divided into two tranches, the first &euro;150m will be reserved for an EU-wide scheme compensating farmers who reduce their milk output over certain reference periods towards the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  For the other element of the package, &euro;350m is set aside for Member State initiatives with fixed allocations per MS.  Ireland will be allocated &euro;11m.  My firm view which I reiterated strongly at Council is that we must have maximum flexibility at MS level to use this funding as we wish and in a way which helps farmers while delivering maximum value for money.  In my view we have to use this in a way which provides relief from current liquidity issues for farmers.

Kerry are considered by my Department under the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, the Foreshore Act 1933 and applicable EU Directives.<\/p><p>Kilmackilloge Harbour is located within Kenmare River Special Area of Conservation (&lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; site).  All applications in &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and\/or Habitats Directives.  An Appropriate Assessment has been carried out by the Marine Institute in respect of Kenmare River Special Area of Conservation.  My Department has prepared an Appropriate Assessment Conclusion Statement which outlines how it is proposed to licence aquaculture in Kenmare Bay Special Area of Conservation in compliance with the Habitats Directive.  This Conclusion Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>While the Appropriate Assessment is carried out on a bay-wide basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually for licensing purposes.  Factors considered include navigation, suitability of the place or waters, likely ecological effects, other beneficial uses (existing or potential) of the waters concerned, the effect or likely effect on the environment in the vicinity of the water of the proposed aquaculture, carrying capacity of the bay, etc.<\/p><p>My Department has requested Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) to carry out a &lsquo;Carrying Capacity&rsquo; study of Kilmackilloge Harbour.  BIM has expertise in this area having previously carried out a carrying capacity study in respect of Killary Harbour.  A carrying capacity study essentially seeks to scientifically establish if the existing and proposed density of sites, and longlines within sites, would have a detrimental effect on the growth of mussels due to, for example, a reduction in water flow or a reduction on plankton passing to mussel lines.  The results of the carrying capacity study will enable improved science-based licence decision making in Kilmackilloge Harbour.<\/p><p>In addition to Natura requirements, under EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directives all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact Screening Assessment.  This requires significant input from my Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors.  All applications, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable legislation, are advertised in order to facilitate public consultation, and submissions or observations received must be considered as part of the licence determination process.<\/p><p>Every effort is being made to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications in Kilmackilloge Harbour having regard to all the complexities involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900104#WRSS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":1953,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900104#WRSS02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1954,"qnumday":725,"qnumall":"[22199\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900104#WRSS02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the name, costs, date of commission, date or expected date of publication and name of the external consultant of all external reports commissioned by his Department since March 2011 in tabular form.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1955,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the table below.

The work focused on the emissions generated from livestock production and considered all upstream emissions, including those arising from the production of imported agricultural inputs such as nitrogenous fertiliser and feed, through to the farm gate.<\/p>  <p>  This analysis, which was published in 2010, confirmed Irish beef production to be amongst the lowest emitters of GHG emissions per kilogram of product, with average emissions per kg of beef estimated at 18.4 kg of CO2 equivalent.  Assuming an average protein content of 250g per kilogram of beef, this will equate to 73.6kg of CO2  equivalent per kilogram of protein.  These low emissions can be attributed to the application of grass-based production efficiencies and low &lsquo;land-use, land-use-change&rsquo; emissions from domestic cropland expansion.  In this regard, the Irish system of beef production can be described as unique in the EU. <\/p>  <p>  While our LCA figures for beef are among the best, they do not tell the full story.  For instance, they do not highlight the important contribution of our permanent pasture &ndash; some 90% of all Irish agricultural land &ndash; to maintaining a very significant carbon pool.  This carbon pool could be released to the atmosphere if land is converted to arable and contribute further to climate change. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that LCA figures should not be considered as static but are used to benchmark further improvements in the efficiency of Irish beef production systems.

The UK is by far our largest trading partner.\u00a0 Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. <\/p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way through the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. <\/p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks. Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.<\/p>  <p>  I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. <\/p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:   <\/p>  <p>-   I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;   <\/p>  <p>-   I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which has already met for the first time, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;<\/p>  <p>-   I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and <\/p>  <p>-  The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900105#WRTT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1987,"content":"<p>Question No. 736 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Issues","counter":1988,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900105#WRTT01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1989,"qnumday":737,"qnumall":"[22451\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900105#WRTT01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the interpretation of land eligibility that was confirmed by a person (details supplied) at the hill farmers conference on 20 June 2016 is the interpretation that always applied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1990,"content":"<p>Following the introduction of the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 the Department issued the Guide to Land Eligibility Booklet to all landowners.

The Foal Levy is currently calculated with reference to SI 735 of 2011 which is the governing legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Statutory scheme requires the owner of each thoroughbred foal born in Ireland, requiring registration, to register in the General Stud Book through the offices of Weatherbys Ireland GSB Limited and pay at registration time a levy to Horse Racing Ireland.  The actual levy payable is related to the generally applicable (advertised) nomination fee of the foal&rsquo;s sire and varies between &euro;35 (where the nomination fee is less than &euro;1,001) and &euro;650 (where the nomination fee is in excess of &euro;30,001).  Special deals do not apply in calculating the levy payable.

","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2088,"content":"<p>I note and welcome the recent appointment of Ms. Andrea Leadsom MP as UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.  Given that she has just been appointed, it has not been possible for me to make any plans to meet with her, but I look forward to getting an opportunity to do so in due course.  However, at the meeting of Agriculture Ministers yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet Mr George Eustice, recently re-appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.<\/p><p>More generally in terms of the issues that will affect farming and the agri-food sector, and the implementation of the CAP, it is clear that the decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.\u00a0 Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.<\/p><p>This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. <\/p><p>Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agri-food trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agri-food sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. <\/p><p>It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. <\/p><p>Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. <\/p><p>The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.<\/p><p>I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget (and its implications for CAP implementation), regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector.<\/p><p>However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.<\/p><p>In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:<\/p><p>-I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;<\/p><p>-I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which has already met for the first time, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;<\/p><p>-I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and <\/p><p>-The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900107#WRVV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme","counter":2089,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900107#WRVV01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2090,"qnumday":772,"qnumall":"[22807\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900107#WRVV01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive their young farmers scheme top-up payment.

Exports in 2015 recorded double digit growth to reach &euro;410 million.  In volume terms exports are likely to increase from 7 million cases in 2014 to 12 million cases by 2020 and 24 million cases by 2030.  Significant investment has taken place since 2011 in expansion of existing facilities and development of new distilleries.  However, release of additional capacity on to the market will take time as whiskey must, under EU and Irish law, be matured in wood for at least three years.  So the product of distillations in 2016 and 2017 will come on the market close to 2020.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the Compecon report by Dr. Pat Massey which concluded that the lack of a wholesale market in Irish Whiskey and the ageing requirement are barriers to expansion.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendation on developing a wholesale whiskey market to facilitate the development of Irish Whiskey brands by businesses which do not themselves have distilling capacity is interesting and is also suggested in the industry Vision for Irish Whiskey.  I would welcome initiatives to facilitate the development of such a market but do not have the power to compel individual distilling companies to set aside part of their production for a wholesale market.<\/p>  <p>  Establishing an un-aged Irish Whiskey category is, however, ruled out by Regulation (EC) No 110\/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which applies both to product placed on the market in the Community and that produced in the Community for export.  The Regulation defines the Whiskey category in some detail, including a requirement that the final distillate be matured for at least three years in wooden casks.  Product which has not been matured for this period may not be described as Whiskey or retain the EU geographical indication status accorded to Irish Whiskey, which is one of the geographical indications included in a number of bilateral trade agreements between the EU and third countries.  At national level, the Irish Whiskey Act, 1980 requires that Irish Whiskey be matured in wooden casks for at least three years in warehouses in the State and\/or Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to explore with the industry and development agencies ways of developing and showcasing the portfolio of Irish Whiskey brands to promote awareness of Irish Whiskey in international markets and to contribute to the export and development goals of FoodWise 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900108#WRWW03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":2147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900108#WRWW03500"},{"type":"question","counter":2148,"qnumday":791,"qnumall":"[22896\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900108#WRWW03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to confirm receipt of an application for funding from an organisation (details supplied) which has made significant progress in the past two years and which sum is now required in order to allow it to continue to progress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2149,"content":"<p>My department has received an application from the body referred to by the Deputy and is considering the matter at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900108#WRWW03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":2150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900108#WRWW03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2151,"qnumday":792,"qnumall":"[23504\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900108#WRWW03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the cost of implementing a pay increase to all those employed under the remit of his Department after 1 January 2011 of 2% 4% and 5%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2152,"content":"<p>The estimated cost of implementing pay increases to all employed by my Department of 2%, 4% and 5 % from 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2016 is &euro;19.13m, &euro;38.25m and &euro;47.8m respectively.

Under S.I. 243 of 2012,\u00a0the European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2012, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is designated as the Issuing Authority with responsibility for the registration of BER assessors, maintaining the registers of BER assessments, quality assurance, awareness raising and ongoing management of the BER scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The BER Assessment system is an energy label with accompanying advisory report for homes.  The rating is a simple A to G scale that reflects the level of energy consumption that would be typical of that home.  A-rated homes are the most energy efficient and will tend to have the lowest energy bills.\u00a0 Every property offered for sale or rent in Ireland must have a BER and that BER must be included in any advertisements.  To date, more than 650,000 BER assessments have been registered with SEAI, meaning that around 40% of dwellings in Ireland have an associated BER assessment.<\/p>  <p>  Studies conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) have found that BER assessments can have a significant effect on the value of a property.  An ESRI study conducted on 36,000 properties offered for sale or rent, &ldquo;The Value of Domestic Building Energy Efficiency &ndash; Evidence from Ireland,&rdquo; found that relative to D-rated properties, otherwise comparable A-rated properties receive a sale price premium of 9.3%.A BER must be performed by an appropriately qualified BER assessor.  To qualify as an assessor, a person must successfully complete a training course for BER assessors, pass a BER examination, have the required insurance policies, and complete the SEAI registration process.  There are currently approximately 900 BER assessors registered with SEAI.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure the quality of the work performed by these assessors, SEAI aims to audit around 2% of all BER reports.  The audit process and associated timings are published and publicly available in SEAI&rsquo;s Quality Assurance System and Disciplinary Procedure.  SEAI also has procedures in place to deal with any complaints, disputes or appeals that may arise and copies of these procedures are available on SEAI&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  SEAI have more recently (May 2016) published new procedures to support the development of BER assessors.  These changes come into effect from 1st August and introduce such improvements as Mentoring Audits to assist BER assessors.  A new BER advisory report will also be introduced by the end of this year.  This new advisory report will provide improved information on the potential energy efficiency upgrades a householder can make.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that BER assessors have a key role to play as trusted advisors to homeowners and those renting property, by helping them make informed choices about the potential energy efficiency improvements they can make in their home.  Given the importance of this role, the amount of properties that have a BER assessment and the impact this assessment can have on the value of a property, it is vital that robust quality control procedures are in place to ensure the integrity, reputation and quality of the BER system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management Regulations","counter":2191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX02500"},{"type":"question","counter":2192,"qnumday":809,"qnumall":"[22672\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the body with responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of persons in an area (details supplied).","asker":"1235","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":2193,"content":"<p>I understand that the issue of Waste Licences is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency and consequently I have no function in the matter.<\/p><p>Applications for planning permission, including compliance with the conditions of planning permissions are matters for the relevant planning authority and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has no function in the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers Data","counter":2194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX02800"},{"type":"question","counter":2195,"qnumday":810,"qnumall":"[22728\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of politically appointed staff working in his Department including the names, roles and salaries of each staff member; in the case of special advisers, their qualifications and experience relevant to their roles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1276","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":2196,"content":"<p>The following political staff were appointed to and are currently paid by my Department: <table><tr><th>Name<\/th><th>Grade <\/th><th>Gross Salary per annum<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ross Elwood<\/td><td>Special Adviser<\/td><td>&euro;79,401<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Suzie Coogan<\/td><td>Special Adviser<\/td><td>&euro;79,401<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Michael Concar<\/td><td>Civilian Driver<\/td><td>&euro;34,669.70<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Liam Feehily<\/td><td>Civilian Driver<\/td><td>&euro;34,669.70<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The appointments of all of the above staff were conducted in accordance with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences","counter":2197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2198,"qnumday":811,"qnumall":"[22840\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900109#WRXX03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 620 of 5 July 2016, if his Department, in preparing for issuing the licences in the Atlantic Margin oil and gas exploration licensing round, carried out an environmental impact assessment of the potential effect that further oil and gas exploration could have on climate change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":2199,"content":"<p>EU Directive 2001\/42\/EC, commonly known as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive, provides for a formal environmental assessment of certain plans and programmes which are likely to have significant effects on the environment.\u00a0 The Directive applies to plans or programmes instigated on or after 21 July 2004.

With regard to revenue, the most recent CSO Quarterly Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding carrier receipts) in the first three months of 2016 amounted to over &euro;693 million, an increase of 17.5% compared to the same period in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Quarterly National Household Survey figures indicate that employment in the &lsquo;Accommodation and Food Service Activities&rsquo; sector was 145,900 (seasonally adjusted) for the first quarter of 2016, compared with 135,400 in the same period last year, a rise of 7.8%.  This is having real economic benefits for towns and villages right across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s targets for 2016 are to grow overseas visit numbers by a further 4%, and grow the associated revenue by 5%.  Early figures for 2016 suggest that we are likely to exceed these amounts.  Obviously the recent EU Referendum decision\u00a0may have\u00a0implications on outbound tourism but the\u00a0Great Britain\u00a0market will\u00a0remain of significant importance to Irish tourism\u00a0and I believe\u00a0that Ireland's excellent\u00a0tourism offering \u00a0will ensure that we\u00a0continue to perform strongly.  Tourism Ireland is closely monitoring the situation\u00a0and\u00a0is due to meet with tourism industry representatives later this week\u00a0to plan ahead in this new market\u00a0environment.  Amongst the\u00a0longer-term tourism goals, as outlined in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement are that by 2025: revenue from overseas visitors will increase to &euro;5 billion, net of inflation supported by\u00a010 million overseas visits to Ireland annually and I am confident that we will achieve these targets.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, a Tourism Leadership Group was appointed to put in place a Tourism Action Plan containing key actions required in the period to 2018 in order to achieve the overall objectives in the Policy Statement.  The Tourism Action Plan was published in January and contains actions across a range of key issues including skills in the tourism industry; supply of visitor accommodation; overseas tourism marketing, and the contribution of Local Authorities to tourism development.

That is partly because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies. <\/p><p>The number of site visits to a particular county is also better viewed against the background of the wider progress IDA Ireland is making in generating new jobs across the country.  This can be seen in the Agency&rsquo;s record 2015 results, in which a total of 18,983 jobs were created with employment in IDA Ireland client companies rising to 187,056.  The Agency has also made regional development a cornerstone of its five-year strategy and is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30%-40% in each individual region outside Dublin.<\/p><p><b>IDA Ireland Jobs Statistics 2015; Site Visits 2015 and Quarter 1 2016 by County<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>No. of Companies<\/th><th>Total Jobs<\/th><th>New Jobs2015<\/th><th>Site Visits 2015<\/th><th>Site Visits Q1 2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>768<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan <\/td><td>7<\/td><td>1,165<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>6,599<\/td><td>646<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>148<\/td><td>31,900<\/td><td>4,062<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>2,918<\/td><td>330<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>652<\/td><td>77,244<\/td><td>8,864<\/td><td>242<\/td><td>57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>14,297<\/td><td>1,267<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>1,931<\/td><td>89<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>10,313<\/td><td>679<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny <\/td><td>5<\/td><td>650<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>97<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>423<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>8,849<\/td><td>1,018<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>686<\/td><td>46<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>3,245<\/td><td>317<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>3,981<\/td><td>159<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>1,571<\/td><td>89<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>146<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>902<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>936<\/td><td>99<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>2,029<\/td><td>132<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>3,518<\/td><td>95<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>5,662<\/td><td>536<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>2,529<\/td><td>212<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>2,486<\/td><td>101<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>2,211<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>1,254<\/td><td>187,056<\/td><td>18,983<\/td><td>565<\/td><td>136<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900113#WRBBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","counter":2374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900113#WRBBB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2375,"qnumday":872,"qnumall":"[21999\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900113#WRBBB02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she considered establishing a dedicated unit to co-ordinate activities to mitigate the impact of the British exit from the European Union referendum; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":2376,"content":"<p>A central cross-Government co-ordination unit in regard to Brexit has been established in the Department of the Taoiseach. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to my own Department, given the breath and diversity of policy and operational areas that are relevant to the United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union, this is a matter that impacts on, and is being monitored by, all of the Divisions across my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the UK referendum result on 24 June, as part of my contingency plans, I have established a Coordination Group within my Department consisting of relevant enterprise, single market, and trade officials, together with the Chief Executive Officers of IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to oversee the management of our immediate response, including the messaging to businesses both at home and overseas.

The Authority is charged with statutory responsibilities in the following key areas:<\/p><p>- To regulate and promote the safety, health and welfare of people at work and those affected by work activities;<\/p><p>- To regulate and promote the safe manufacture, use, placing on the market, trade and transport of chemicals;<\/p><p>- To act as the surveillance authority in relation to relevant single European market legislation;<\/p><p>- To act as the national accreditation body.<\/p><p>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s annual grant is broken down into pay and non-pay&ndash; it does not provide specific allocations for particular programme areas such as workplace health and safety regulation, chemicals regulation, and national accreditation or for safety initiatives including the organisation of information and awareness campaigns.<\/p><p>The Authority depends upon the annual exchequer allocation provided by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) to fund the implementation of its programme of work.  Within that context, and informed by its current three year Statement of Strategy 2016-2018, the Authority prioritises initiatives in those areas where there is greatest risk and the greatest potential to maximise its efforts to achieve a continued downward trend in workplace deaths, accidents, injuries and ill health, and to increase the safe use of chemicals. <\/p><p>Health and Safety Authority Inspectors carry out inspections across all work sectors and work activities which come under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) and the Chemicals Act 2008.  Most inspections are targeted at the high risk sectors such as construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, mines, quarries, transport of dangerous goods by road, or the chemical sectors.  Other inspections can be part of a particular safety awareness campaign e.g. on manual handling, on slips, trips or falls or on compliance with the REACH Regulation.  The Authority produces a Programme of Work each year setting out its plan for all areas of its work, including inspection targets. The annual Programme of Work is submitted to the Minister for approval.<\/p><p>The number of workplace inspections carried out from 2011 to 2016 (14\/07\/16) is set out in the following table <\/p><p><b>Table 1 <\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of workplace inspections and investigations <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>15,340<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>13,835<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>12,244<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>10,719<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>10,880<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 (recorded as of 14 July)<\/td><td>5,917<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>While the falling inspection rates between 2011 and 2014 in Table 2 above can be attributed to the loss of inspection staff, the programme of inspections has been increased by the Authority in 2016 and continues to be targeted at areas of highest risk.  The Authority&rsquo;s 2016 Programme of Work set a target of 11,165 inspections and investigations and its performance is currently on target.<\/p><p>The Authority has also invested significant resources in recent years in enabling enterprises to achieve compliance in the simplest, most cost-effective manner.  The Authority&rsquo;s BeSMART.ie risk assessment and management tool for small enterprises has been developed and expanded for the construction and agri-business sectors.  The Authority also ran safety awareness campaigns relating to farming, construction, vehicle safety and fishing safety, along with promoting the BeSMART safety management tool to small businesses.  It has also run campaigns to alert consumers to the potential dangers from detergent liquitabs. <\/p><p>In 2015 the Authority&rsquo;s exchequer Grant was increased by &euro;250,000 during the course of the year (following re-allocations made in light of the Department&rsquo;s 2015 mid-year expenditure review) to facilitate special safety initiatives aimed at Agriculture and Construction.<\/p><p>Since the Authority is allocated funding for pay and non-pay, it uses its non-pay allocation to cover a range of administrative ICT, accommodation, and other running costs, in addition to providing funding for information and awareness activities, including specific safety initiatives. Consequently, the funding provision for particular programmes, including specific safety initiatives, fluctuates from year to year as the Authority decides how to prioritise its non-pay funding in order to implement its programme of work. <\/p><p>In the current year (see Table 2 below) the  Non Pay budget decided by the Authority includes a reduction in the provision for &quot;safety initiatives&quot; in 2016 in light of other priorities of the Authority&rsquo;s overall programme of work for this year, including developments affecting office accommodation, a necessary business process review arising from the integration of INAB and the replacement of the current manual system used in the INAB accreditation process, as part of the development of a new Client Management System (a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs, 2016) <\/p><p><b>Table 2<\/b><\/p><p><b>Amount of money spent on Health and Safety Initiatives 2011 to 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Estimated Spend on Safety Initiatives (excl.

The agreement covers virtually every aspect of economic activity, and it is extremely important for Ireland.  It offers significant opportunities for growth in trade for with Canada.  The agreement opens up public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.

Business Report published by the National Competitiveness Council on April 21st provides an assessment of Ireland's cost competitiveness performance vis-a-vis a range of competitor countries.  The report, which has been noted by Government, concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit \/financial, and business service.  It finds that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years.  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.<\/p>  <p>  Despite these improvements, Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a range of key business inputs.  There is upward cost pressure evident in the market for commercial insurance.  The report is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  To protect the gains achieved to date, to sustain the recovery, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our cost competitiveness.  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business report and the associated reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be brought to Government and published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance costs are relevant to businesses of all sizes and in all sectors of the economy.  In general insurance costs account for a relatively low proportion of the overall enterprise cost base.  While insurance costs represent a minor component of enterprise operating costs, premium increases can have an impact on costs, particularly for SMEs and micro enterprises.  Under EU law, the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited.  While the provision and the pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, competitive and transparent markets are vital.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department has no role in the supervision or regulation of insurance, which is primarily a policy and supervisory matter for the Department of Finance and the Central Bank respectively, last year, the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) considered the commercial insurance market in Ireland as part of its 2015 Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report.  It subsequently set out a range of potential actions which could help facilitate enhanced cost competitiveness in the non-life commercial insurance market.  These were set out in its Competitiveness Challenge 2015 report.  The Council concluded that the absence of price data makes it very difficult to assess market conditions and competitiveness in the non-life insurance market.  The Council subsequently recommended that responsibility for improving insurance cost competitiveness of commercial insurance must be clearly assigned and accorded sufficient priority by policymakers and there is a need to comprehensively benchmark insurance costs and the drivers of costs in Ireland with costs in our key competitors.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is currently examining the factors which contribute to increasing costs of insurance.  This work is part of an overall review of policy in the insurance sector which that Department is carrying out in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments, Agencies and external stakeholders.  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance in their ongoing work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900114#WRCCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":2399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900114#WRCCC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":2400,"qnumday":882,"qnumall":"[22185\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071900114#WRCCC01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the new EMF workplace directive (2013\/35 EU) has been transposed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":2401,"content":"<p>The provisions of Directive 2013\/35\/EU were transposed through the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Electromagnetic Fields) Regulations, 2016 (S.I.

I understand the dispute concerned enhanced redundancy terms for a number of staff employed in the Community Development Projects.  This matter was not one of enforcing an employment right where a ruling relating to a breach would be enforceable.  It refers to an industrial relations dispute where better terms are sought.<\/p>  <p>  This dispute was referred to the Conciliation Service of the Labour Relations Commission in the first instance however no resolution was reached at conciliation and the dispute was subsequently referred to the Labour Court under Section 26(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in a case and then issuing a Recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled.  In this case a hearing took place in April 2010 and the Labour Court issued a Recommendation in May 2010.  In its Recommendation the Court recommended redundancy terms of three weeks pay per year of service in addition to statutory terms, which is two weeks.<\/p>  <p>  A recommendation issued by the Labour Court under Section 26(1) of the Industrial Relation Act 1990 is not binding on the parties concerned.  However while the Recommendation is not binding on the parties, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the Court's Recommendation.

The CCPC has investigated and successfully challenged (both directly and through the courts) a number of agreements on this basis.<\/p>  <p>  The CCPC was formally established in October 2014.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established last year and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15.  That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1st January last.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission is due to submit its second Report today.

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.<\/p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case.<\/p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision regarding an individual working as an Au Pair does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  I have no plans to review the status of au pairs with a view to deeming persons determined to be employees to be outside the scope of employment law.  My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area is primarily concerned with ensuring that those people found to be employees can enforce their rights, as provided for under employment rights legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, certain reckonable components may be taken into account for all workers to determine an employee&rsquo;s average hourly rate.  In this context, if an employer provides an employee with full board and lodgings, or lodgings only or full board only, a monetary allowance can be included as reckonable pay (The term &lsquo;full board&rsquo; means an entitlement to meals during the day), as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;54.13 for board and lodgings per week, or &euro;7.73 per day;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;32.14 for board only per week, or &euro;4.60 per day;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;21.85 for lodgings only per week, or &euro;3.14 per day.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of this provision in the National Minimum Wage legislation was recommended by the Inter-Departmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage.  It was the view of the Inter-Departmental Group that the monetary value of the allowances for the purpose of the National Minimum Wage would not be set at market value but rather would be similar to the amount provided for in Employment Regulation Orders.<\/p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) Order 2000 (SI No. 95\/2000) provided for the amounts specified.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated during the debate on the Au Pair Placement Bill 2016 during Private Members' Business last week, I am very conscious of the passage of time since the board and lodgings rates were set.
