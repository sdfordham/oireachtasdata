It has come to my attention that the clothing grant for children, which is available through community welfare officers and is specifically for clothing children at the time of their first holy communion and confirmation should families not be able to afford that, has been withdrawn and cut completely.  I have this on very good authority.  The main centre in north Dublin at Swords is not providing any grants and has gone further in informing primary schools to advise parents not to make any applications.  The Minister for Social Protection has made no announcement on this and there is an attempt to make the school principals in my area do the Minister's bidding, but they will not do it.  I wrote to the Minister last night, but I ask the Leader to seek clarification from the Minister as to whether this grant has been withdrawn effectively.  If that is the case it is nothing short of disgraceful.  First holy communion and confirmation are very important milestones in children's lives and many parents cannot afford to clothe children appropriately for those days.  That grant has been available for years and is now withdrawn.  The Minister has made no public announcement on it and she will certainly not get away with school principals doing her dirty work.  I ask the Leader to seek clarification from the Minister for Social Protection as to whether that is the case.<\/p><p>I bring to the attention of the House problems with the schools patronage survey, in which areas in north Dublin are partaking.

There is a plan to get rid of us but we will not be silenced yet.  It seems that if you go down to the woods today, the woods might not be there.  They might be sold off, they might be gone.  One might not have any access to them.  There is a plan to sell off Coillte, as far as I can see, behind our backs.  No one seems to know who is responsible for it.  Is it the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  Is it the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources?  Is it the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform?  Will we wake up some morning and hear on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; that Coillte is sold and gone?  I have never heard anything as daft, as Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell stated, as that we will sell off the trees but nothing else.<\/p><p>I am not aware that Coillte grows anything else.  Is there something I do not know about that is going on down in the woods?  What would Coillte be without the forestry?  There are 150 recreational sites across this country owned and managed by Coillte.  Thousands of Irish and visitors and tourists enjoy the forests and recreational parks.  It is a short-sighted proposal.  It is unsound and unsafe.  Whoever came up with it cannot see the wood for the trees.  We must stop it.  We must find out which Minister is responsible.  We are selling the family silver from underneath the people.  We have had contact from a range of organisations including Mountaineering Ireland, Birdwatch Ireland, An \u00d3ige, An Taisce and the Irish Wildlilfe Trust.  I urge those organisations to unite and combine with public representatives on all sides of the House to stop the sell-off of Coillte.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100004#C01500","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1359628800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100004#C01600","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1359628800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100004#C01700","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359628800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>For what?

We should be treated with respect.  The resolution on the armed conflict in the Congo will be taken without debate and it will be without dispute.<\/p><p>With regard to Coillte I share the passion of my two colleagues, Senators O'Donnell and Whelan.  This country was raped of its forests to provide timber for the British navy during the late medieval period.  Now we are doing the same.  It is more like the teddy bears picnic than joined-up Government; if one goes down to the woods today one is in for a big surprise because, as Senator Whelan stated, they may very well be gone.  The issue with regard to the Bacon report is extremely serious.  This is a man previously commissioned by the Government to provide excellent reports which were never acted upon.  He has demonstrated with absolute clarity the economic justification for his proposal is no longer sustainable and that if we sell off this we will expose ourselves to \u20ac1.3 billion of further consequences, so in fact it is a financial farce and is tying us into something.  I know something about this because my family sold off considerable acreage in the 1930s, but the trees were left there and the land was unusable.  It bankrupted people.  It is important that we discuss this.  Mr. Bacon states this action would effectively liquidate Coillte as a viable entity.  Is this what the Government is doing?  This is all supposed to be an attempt to create economies in the country.  We are discussing this on the Order of Business and I salute Senator O'Donnell for bringing it so passionately and effectively before us.<\/p><p>Later we will pass a Bill which will give effect to the very favourable loan arrangements to the Greeks whereby they will be allowed to move it out for 30 years.

As the Leader lives in a constituency with a big rural base, he is aware of many of the issues which pertain.  We can all give examples of services being lost in rural communities.  An example of this today is that more than 100 Garda stations will be closed, the majority of which are in rural communities.  There will be some impact on urban areas but rural communities will disproportionately suffer as a consequence of the stations being lost.  The selling of Coillte and State assets has been raised and this will also have an impact on rural communities.  We know of the lack of funding for local government and issues with regard to funding roads and other issues important for people living in rural communities.  Given the real sense of isolation people living in these communities increasingly feel, these issues deserve and merit a genuine discussion in the House to reflect them and come up with solutions to some of the problems.<\/p><p>A Fianna F\u00e1il Senator stated it would be intolerable for the decision to close Garda stations to be made by civil servants, as he put it.  The reality is that the decision was made by the previous Government when it negotiated the four-year national recovery plan.  This plan, which Fianna F\u00e1il negotiated with the troika, allowed for the reduction in Garda numbers from 14,500 in 2010 to 13,500 and to 13,000 in 2014, so it was part of negotiating the reduction in Garda numbers.  It is being implemented by the current Government.  I look forward to the Private Members' motion to be tabled by Fianna F\u00e1il next week, but let us hope it is an honest debate about where parties stand on these issues.  Let us also have an honest discussion about how we can support these communities in the difficult times they face and ensure they have the resources to be able to live the lives they want to live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100005#D01400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359629400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that today the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, will launch guidelines for mental health and suicide prevention in post-primary schools.

We are all only too well aware of the spate of suicides we have had in recent times generated by bullying in schools.  Post-primary education is when children should have the best and happiest moments they will ever have in their lives, but unfortunately because of the system we have created and generated, it is not the experience our children have.  The experience is worsening instead of improving.  I do not believe there is a parent of a teenage child in this country who does not live in fear.  The incidence of depression among children is significantly increasing as are suicide and bullying.  Recently a second level school parent, with whom I had reason to speak, whose child had been accused of bullying told me it is better to be the bully than have one's child bullied.  This country has a job to do with regard to education and these guidelines could not come soon enough.

The allegation of corruption within the Garda is outrageous, unfounded and should be withdrawn.<\/p><p>  This morning, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children signed off on the report in respect of the hearings on the proposed new legislation dealing with the X and the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland cases.  It just goes to show how work can be done.  A total of 31 different groups or individuals made oral submissions at the three day hearing while a further 40 groups or individuals made written submissions.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has now condensed these written and oral submissions into a report the joint committee was able to present to the Minister today.<\/p><p>  One point the three day hearing showed pertained to disseminating information.  I note Senator O'Donnell raised the issue of a change in policy in respect of Coillte.  Perhaps it will be necessary to do what the joint committee did with those public hearings when a fundamental change in policy takes place.  In cases in which a Department makes a change in respect of public policy, it might be an idea to hold such open hearings in order that various groups which have an interest could make a submission.  This is one measure that should be done, rather than simply having a debate that is confined to Members in this House.  People who have genuine concerns about a change in public policy should be allowed to come in and have their say regarding these concerns, after which Members can move forward on what is the best way for the country to adopt and change policy.  This would be one way to do it.<\/p><p>  Members should note that within a 20 day period, the joint committee had three days of public hearing and now has a report ready.

I wish to express caution in respect of the proposed sale of the national lottery.  Over the 25 years of its existence, the affinity every parish and community has had with the national lottery is remarkable.  In one way or another, every town and village has received funding from the national lottery for sports facilities, health facilities and so on.  It would be worthwhile were Members to have a debate in this House on the national lottery with the Minister present.  Members could express their ideas as to how best this national treasure can be resourced for the betterment of the community, as it has done in the past.  That said, I also request that the Leader arrange, at some future date, to have a debate on gambling and on online gambling in particular.  A serious issue is developing whereby <i>paddypower.ie<\/i> and similar websites are being used by banks as a refusal kit for young people trying to get mortgages.  A debate on this issue at some stage would be worthwhile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100007#G02900","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1359630600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I welcome the possibility of having a debate on policing, as has been proposed from the other side of the Chamber.  I am sure the Leader will do whatever is necessary in that regard.  A few days ago, I mentioned the possibility of a corridor along the Border in what was formerly known as bandit country and where, unfortunately, there has been this awful, sad and atrocious crime.<\/p> <p>There is no way that criminal gangs should be able to feel safe in operating from a safe retreat, probably in south Armagh, committing crimes here and then retreating back to wherever they feel safe, or <i>vice versa<\/i>for that matter.  There is wonderful co-operation between the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the PSNI.  It is better than ever before but I believe they should be able to operate jointly in a corridor along the Border.  I look forward to pursuing that issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am sure it is something that the forces themselves are discussing.  We must make sure that the forces can accompany one another across the Border, whether they are in hot pursuit or otherwise.  We must deter these criminals and we must wipe out these kinds of serious crimes.  There is a problem in that area.  Some may call it the elephant in the room but we are aware of it.  There is a view that the PSNI see south Armagh as a no-go area, so to speak.  That must be changed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100007#G03000","speaker":"1151","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359631200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Senator O'Brien mentioned the question of the communion allowance and, as has been pointed out by Senator Kelly, who was a community welfare officer himself, the payment was never a grant <i>per se<\/i>.  People who found themselves in dire need could apply to the local community welfare officer for assistance with clothing costs and so forth and can still do so.  Government funding has been streamlined and the amounts allocated will, no doubt, be reduced.  While I have no information on the matter of school principals instructing parents on this issue, I think it is very unlikely that any Department would ask school principals to become involved in the way suggested by Senator O'Brien.  However, if the Senator has further information, I would certainly be prepared to pursue it.<\/p><p>  On the question of the survey on school patronage, I find it difficult to accept that there is no correlation between the PPS numbers and the people who responded to the survey.  I find it difficult to accept that this is not checked and that if somebody gives my PPS number but not my name, this would not be discovered.  I presume such checks are done and that the PPS number would be checked against the person's name.  Otherwise, the survey is flawed and I would accept that.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Brien also mentioned that we will have a Private Member's motion from Fianna F\u00e1il on policing next week and I welcome that debate.  A number of Senators have commented today on the whole question of policing, the closure of Garda stations and so on.  We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues in a two hour debate next week.<\/p><p>  Senator Bacik also referred to school patronage, which we debated in this House last May.  A total of 12 Members took part in that debate and, if necessary, we can have another debate on the issue some time in the near future.  Senator O'Donnell spoke passionately about the sale of the national lottery and Coillte, matters which were also raised by other Senators.  May I remind Senator O'Donnell that on 23 May 2012, she tabled a Private Member's motion on the sale of the national lottery.  We had a two hour debate and the issue got a good airing at that time.  Regarding Coillte, we also had a debate in the House in April last year on the sale of State assets and only 12 Members participated.  However, if Members feel we should have a further debate, we can arrange it with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who was here for the debate last year.  Senators sometimes forget that matters have been discussed previously.  We cannot keep coming back to the same subjects every few months.<\/p><p>  I totally accept Senator Barrett's comments on the need for a properly regulated health insurance sector and that is definitely an issue to which we should return.  Senator White raised the issue of policing and made specific reference to the relationship between the PSNI and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  The two forces now have an excellent relationship, better than at any time in the past.  I attended Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe's funeral yesterday and was delighted to see the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, the British ambassador and the Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland in attendance.  It showed the solidarity that exists and that is necessary between both police forces on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100008#H00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100008#H00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I hope the solidarity that was shown yesterday will continue and that the perpetrators of this dire act will be brought to justice as soon as possible and will, on conviction, serve the appropriate sentence of 40 years.<\/p><p>Senator Moran also mentioned the funeral of Detective Garda Donohoe yesterday and we would all salute the courage and dignity of the Donohoe family and, indeed, the strength of support from the community of Dundalk and of Lordship in particular.  That sense of solidarity was mirrored throughout the country.  There is a firm belief that we can bring these people to justice.  Garda Donohoe's murder has also solidified the strength and sense of purpose of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  I concur with Senator Leyden's point and also abhor any Member of the other House calling the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, our proud force, corrupt.  It is absolutely disgraceful and outrageous, particularly at this point in time.  It should not be tolerated.  People can get away with these comments sometimes, but not at this particular point in time.  We cannot have these types of statements being uttered on television and radio.  It is completely irresponsible.<\/p><p>Senator Whelan also spoke about the sale of Coillte and, as I have already said, we will invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the House to deal with that matter.  Senator Norris spoke about the motion regarding the Order of Business and Oireachtas committees.  I fully agree with Senator Norris and the sentiments of this motion.  If Senators look around now they will see that we have more Members than usual here at this point in time.

Senator Cullinane called for a debate on rural Ireland and I am sure that will form part of the debate on policing scheduled for next week.  Senator Hayden raised the matter of the guidelines for mental health and suicide prevention in our schools which were published by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Lynch, today.  Senator Donovan referred to a debate on policing which has already been scheduled.  Senator Kelly spoke about social welfare entitlements and getting people back to work.  Senator Mullen also spoke about the school patronage survey and as I have already said, if there is a flaw in that survey, it should be rectified.  Senator Noone referred to increased Wi-Fi availability in Dublin, which is certainly a welcome development that also has the potential to advance our tourism product.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa referred to a school in Caherciveen in County Kerry and the young pupils who were involved in charitable work, which is something we should all encourage.<\/p> <p>I include the Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste, the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, all of whom have used their Irish over the past year.

A number of Garda stations within my community have been closed, including Grangemockler, where my father was born and reared, and up the road at New Inn.<\/p><p>I believe the present Administration has pursued a policy of modernisation of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na the wrong way around.

Those vehicles should have been put in place in rural communities and the new Garda rostering system should have been put in place.  The entire thing should have been allowed to bed in and the Government should have revamped the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes.  Only then should the Government have re-evaluated the need for the existing Garda stations nationwide.  I do not accept the argument, put to me in a previous debate on the community of rural Ireland, that it is not possible to equip 400 vehicles simultaneously in this country.

The allegation of corruption within the Garda is outrageous, unfounded and should be withdrawn.<\/p><p>  This morning, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children signed off on the report in respect of the hearings on the proposed new legislation dealing with the X and the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland cases.  It just goes to show how work can be done.  A total of 31 different groups or individuals made oral submissions at the three day hearing while a further 40 groups or individuals made written submissions.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has now condensed these written and oral submissions into a report the joint committee was able to present to the Minister today.<\/p><p>  One point the three day hearing showed pertained to disseminating information.  I note Senator O'Donnell raised the issue of a change in policy in respect of Coillte.  Perhaps it will be necessary to do what the joint committee did with those public hearings when a fundamental change in policy takes place.  In cases in which a Department makes a change in respect of public policy, it might be an idea to hold such open hearings in order that various groups which have an interest could make a submission.  This is one measure that should be done, rather than simply having a debate that is confined to Members in this House.  People who have genuine concerns about a change in public policy should be allowed to come in and have their say regarding these concerns, after which Members can move forward on what is the best way for the country to adopt and change policy.  This would be one way to do it.<\/p><p>  Members should note that within a 20 day period, the joint committee had three days of public hearing and now has a report ready.  I congratulate everyone involved, particularly the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which has done so much work in recent weeks in compiling it and putting it together for joint committee members to present to the Minister today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100008#G02700","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>As there have been 26 conclusions this morning, I ask Senators Conway and Paul Coghlan to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100008#G02800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I wish to express caution in respect of the proposed sale of the national lottery.  Over the 25 years of its existence, the affinity every parish and community has had with the national lottery is remarkable.  In one way or another, every town and village has received funding from the national lottery for sports facilities, health facilities and so on.  It would be worthwhile were Members to have a debate in this House on the national lottery with the Minister present.  Members could express their ideas as to how best this national treasure can be resourced for the betterment of the community, as it has done in the past.  That said, I also request that the Leader arrange, at some future date, to have a debate on gambling and on online gambling in particular.  A serious issue is developing whereby <i>paddypower.ie<\/i> and similar websites are being used by banks as a refusal kit for young people trying to get mortgages.  A debate on this issue at some stage would be worthwhile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100008#G02900","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I welcome the possibility of having a debate on policing, as has been proposed from the other side of the Chamber.  I am sure the Leader will do whatever is necessary in that regard.  A few days ago, I mentioned the possibility of a corridor along the Border in what was formerly known as bandit country and where, unfortunately, there has been this awful, sad and atrocious crime.<\/p> <p>There is no way that criminal gangs should be able to feel safe in operating from a safe retreat, probably in south Armagh, committing crimes here and then retreating back to wherever they feel safe, or <i>vice versa<\/i>for that matter.  There is wonderful co-operation between the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the PSNI.  It is better than ever before but I believe they should be able to operate jointly in a corridor along the Border.  I look forward to pursuing that issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am sure it is something that the forces themselves are discussing.  We must make sure that the forces can accompany one another across the Border, whether they are in hot pursuit or otherwise.  We must deter these criminals and we must wipe out these kinds of serious crimes.  There is a problem in that area.  Some may call it the elephant in the room but we are aware of it.  There is a view that the PSNI see south Armagh as a no-go area, so to speak.  That must be changed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100008#G03000","speaker":"1151","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359631800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Senator O'Brien mentioned the question of the communion allowance and, as has been pointed out by Senator Kelly, who was a community welfare officer himself, the payment was never a grant <i>per se<\/i>.  People who found themselves in dire need could apply to the local community welfare officer for assistance with clothing costs and so forth and can still do so.  Government funding has been streamlined and the amounts allocated will, no doubt, be reduced.  While I have no information on the matter of school principals instructing parents on this issue, I think it is very unlikely that any Department would ask school principals to become involved in the way suggested by Senator O'Brien.  However, if the Senator has further information, I would certainly be prepared to pursue it.<\/p><p>  On the question of the survey on school patronage, I find it difficult to accept that there is no correlation between the PPS numbers and the people who responded to the survey.  I find it difficult to accept that this is not checked and that if somebody gives my PPS number but not my name, this would not be discovered.  I presume such checks are done and that the PPS number would be checked against the person's name.  Otherwise, the survey is flawed and I would accept that.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Brien also mentioned that we will have a Private Member's motion from Fianna F\u00e1il on policing next week and I welcome that debate.  A number of Senators have commented today on the whole question of policing, the closure of Garda stations and so on.  We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues in a two hour debate next week.<\/p><p>  Senator Bacik also referred to school patronage, which we debated in this House last May.  A total of 12 Members took part in that debate and, if necessary, we can have another debate on the issue some time in the near future.  Senator O'Donnell spoke passionately about the sale of the national lottery and Coillte, matters which were also raised by other Senators.  May I remind Senator O'Donnell that on 23 May 2012, she tabled a Private Member's motion on the sale of the national lottery.  We had a two hour debate and the issue got a good airing at that time.  Regarding Coillte, we also had a debate in the House in April last year on the sale of State assets and only 12 Members participated.  However, if Members feel we should have a further debate, we can arrange it with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who was here for the debate last year.  Senators sometimes forget that matters have been discussed previously.  We cannot keep coming back to the same subjects every few months.<\/p><p>  I totally accept Senator Barrett's comments on the need for a properly regulated health insurance sector and that is definitely an issue to which we should return.  Senator White raised the issue of policing and made specific reference to the relationship between the PSNI and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  The two forces now have an excellent relationship, better than at any time in the past.  I attended Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe's funeral yesterday and was delighted to see the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, the British ambassador and the Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland in attendance.  It showed the solidarity that exists and that is necessary between both police forces on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100009#H00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100009#H00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I hope the solidarity that was shown yesterday will continue and that the perpetrators of this dire act will be brought to justice as soon as possible and will, on conviction, serve the appropriate sentence of 40 years.<\/p><p>Senator Moran also mentioned the funeral of Detective Garda Donohoe yesterday and we would all salute the courage and dignity of the Donohoe family and, indeed, the strength of support from the community of Dundalk and of Lordship in particular.  That sense of solidarity was mirrored throughout the country.  There is a firm belief that we can bring these people to justice.  Garda Donohoe's murder has also solidified the strength and sense of purpose of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  I concur with Senator Leyden's point and also abhor any Member of the other House calling the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, our proud force, corrupt.  It is absolutely disgraceful and outrageous, particularly at this point in time.  It should not be tolerated.  People can get away with these comments sometimes, but not at this particular point in time.  We cannot have these types of statements being uttered on television and radio.  It is completely irresponsible.<\/p><p>Senator Whelan also spoke about the sale of Coillte and, as I have already said, we will invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the House to deal with that matter.  Senator Norris spoke about the motion regarding the Order of Business and Oireachtas committees.  I fully agree with Senator Norris and the sentiments of this motion.  If Senators look around now they will see that we have more Members than usual here at this point in time.  I do not believe Senators should be attending committee meetings during the Order of Business.  I propose that we have a discussion on that motion, in Government time, next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100009#H00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100009#H00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359631800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I firmly agree that this House should take precedence and that the Order of Business, in particular, should take precedence.

Senator Cullinane called for a debate on rural Ireland and I am sure that will form part of the debate on policing scheduled for next week.  Senator Hayden raised the matter of the guidelines for mental health and suicide prevention in our schools which were published by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Lynch, today.  Senator Donovan referred to a debate on policing which has already been scheduled.  Senator Kelly spoke about social welfare entitlements and getting people back to work.  Senator Mullen also spoke about the school patronage survey and as I have already said, if there is a flaw in that survey, it should be rectified.  Senator Noone referred to increased Wi-Fi availability in Dublin, which is certainly a welcome development that also has the potential to advance our tourism product.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa referred to a school in Caherciveen in County Kerry and the young pupils who were involved in charitable work, which is something we should all encourage.<\/p> <p>We should all encourage young people to become involved in charitable causes.  I fully agree with the Senator's assertion in this regard - the intimidation being carried out by <i>The Jerusalem Post<\/i>is totally unacceptable.  The children and school in question should be praised for their efforts and involvement in charitable causes. <\/p><p> Senator Susan O'Keeffe called for a debate on the beef industry.  I will try to arrange such a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in early course.  The debate to be held yesterday with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has been rescheduled and will take place in a couple of weeks. <\/p><p> Senator Feargal Quinn referred to a school where sign language classes may be withdrawn.  If the Senator provides me with precise details of the case, I will raise the matter with the Minister.  I agree with the sentiments he expressed.  He also referred to payments made by Departments to suppliers.  It is essential that Departments pay their suppliers on time.  I am informed that in the fourth quarter of last year, 98% of payments made by Departments to suppliers, with a total value of &#8364;1.25 billion, were made within 15 days.  This is a wonderful improvement on the position over the past 12 months and one that should permeate through to local government and Government agencies.  I agree with the Deputy that prompt payments are the lifeblood of small and medium-sized enterprises.  The Government is living up to its promises in this regard.  The news that Departments are now making payments to suppliers within a 15-day period is to be welcomed by all small businesses. <\/p><p> Senator Michael Mullins referred to the need to reassure communities where Garda stations are closing.  This and other matters, for example, Garda vehicles, can be raised next week when a Private Members' motion is taken on the issue.  <\/p><p> Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh referred to the use of the Irish language in the House during Seachtain na Gaeilge.  I am making arrangements to have the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, come before the House for a debate as Gaeilge during Seachtain na Gaeilge.  A number of Senators can speak fluent Irish.  I understand the Seanad was the only House to debate a Bill exclusively as Gaeilge last year.  Everyone involved in that debate, including the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, should be complimented.  <\/p><p> I concur with the comments made by Senator Leyden.  <\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke referred to the recent public hearings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and proposed similar public hearings to discuss changes in public policy.  This issue could probably be addressed.  We have received requests from ASHOKA and other organisations to discuss changes in public policy with Members.  Perhaps the matter could be addressed soon through the Seanad Public Consultation Committee. <\/p><p> Senator Martin Conway called for a debate on gambling, specifically online gambling.  I agree with him on this matter and I am disappointed that legislation to introduce a tax on online gambling has not yet come before the House.  The sector continues to get away scot free.  I hope the Bill, which is on the list of legislation, will be expedited. <\/p><p> Senator Paul Coghlan called for a corridor along the Border to allow members of the PSNI and Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na cross the Border and indicated he intended to raise this proposal with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am sure he will be able to do so during next week's Private Members' motion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100009#H00600","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1359632400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"The Gathering Ireland 2013: Statements","time":1359632400,"counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100010#J00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1359632400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House today about The Gathering Ireland 2013 and outline progress on the initiative at the beginning of a very significant year for Irish tourism.<\/p><p>Tourism has always been an important driver of economic activity for Ireland.  It is estimated that the tourism and hospitality industry employs approximately 185,000 people and every year generates in the region of \u20ac5.5 billion in revenue from home and abroad.  It is an industry largely populated by smaller enterprises and is deeply rooted in the fabric of economic life, urban and rural.<\/p><p>In terms of overseas visits, we were fortunate to enjoy a number of years of successive growth until 2007 when the number of overseas visits reached more than 8 million.  However, with the general global economic downturn, we endured a highly challenging period during which we experienced a reduction in overseas visits in each of the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 and numbers fell back to slightly more than 6 million visits.  When the Government took office in 2011 it decided to place the tourism sector at the heart of its economic recovery programme.  The jobs initiative introduced a lower VAT rate for key tourism services, lower PRSI rates, a visa waiver scheme and an air access strategy.  We built on this initiative in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, with continuing commitment to tourism services and investment.  In addition, despite the challenging economic circumstances in which we found ourselves, we continued to provide significant resources for overseas tourism marketing activity.<\/p><p>These measures have worked.  The number of overseas visits to Ireland increased in 2011 for the first time since 2007, reaching more than 6.5 million, an increase of 7% on 2010 levels.  In addition, figures released earlier this week show this positive momentum has continued with a small increase again recorded in 2012 and all of our main markets performing very strongly and showing solid growth, with the exception of Great Britain.<\/p><p>While all of the Government measures I outlined were important, the time was right for an initiative of even greater significance, something that would create a new buzz and momentum for Irish tourism.  Having met with the tourism agencies, I was persuaded that the idea of inviting the world to a year long celebration of everything that is best about Ireland could provide a real boost for the sector.  It was in the context of the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2011 in Dublin Castle that I announced the concept of The Gathering Ireland 2013.  The initiative was driven by two imperatives: first, the need to explore how the Irish at home and abroad and those with a strong interest in and affinity for Ireland could work together and contribute to our overall efforts at economic recovery; and, second, to examine ways in which Ireland and its global network could build on their existing relationship not only in economic terms, but also in terms of community and connection.  The overall target of The Gathering Ireland was to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visitors to Ireland in 2013.  Assuming this target is achieved, and I am confident it will be, the initiative will generate an additional \u20ac170 million in revenue for the economy this year.<\/p><p>While the initial idea for The Gathering came from F\u00e1ilte Ireland, once the Government decided to fully commit to it I was clear that we did not want the initiative to be done by the Government as such.  I wanted everyone across the country to have a part to play to help make it a successful, bottom-up initiative.  Thankfully, the call to action was heeded and every county is playing its part.<\/p> <p> In terms of how preparations for the event evolved from the initial launch, a tremendous amount of work was done throughout last year.  F\u00e1ilte Ireland, the lead agency for the implementation of the initiative, put in place a project executive team to implement it and Mr. Jim Miley, the former chairman of Concern International, was appointed project director to drive the initiative forward.  A project advisory group was also established with representatives from the private sector, academia, the tourism industry and the State agencies.  Tourism Ireland has specific responsibility for promoting The Gathering in overseas markets and also provided staff for the project team.<\/p><p>The St. Patrick's Day festivities last March were used for the main overseas launch while key international tourism industry partners were invited to become part of The Gathering at F\u00e1ilte Ireland's Meitheal trade fair in April.  A major domestic launch took place on Friday, 11 May 2012 in Dublin Castle at an event attended by the Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and myself.<\/p><p>To garner support at local level, a series of The Gathering community meetings were held throughout Ireland, providing an opportunity for people to learn more about The Gathering and how they could be part of it.  More than 7,000 people attended 60 community meetings throughout the country.  A website was established with information on how people could become involved, including online support for potential organisers to submit queries and download promotional material.  In addition, a dedicated social media channel was established to promote the event.<\/p><p>In terms of resources, I was pleased to provide a specific additional \u20ac5 million allocation to F\u00e1ilte Ireland last year and this was ring-fenced for preparations.  This allocation was primarily used for establishing the support structure and for marketing the event.  That is a brief overview of the foundations of The Gathering and I will now turn to how the finished product is looking and briefly summarise the plans for the remainder of the year.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that the general response from the public and all tourism stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive and has exceeded my expectations.  The latest update shows that there are almost 2,800 gatherings of all shapes and sizes taking place throughout the country.  The 2013 Estimates allocations to F\u00e1ilte Ireland include \u20ac7 million specifically for The Gathering.  This is to be used exclusively to fund the promotion, development and legacy of The Gathering.  In terms of online activity, The Gathering has had more than 750,000 visits to its website.  It has more than 45,000 Facebook fans and more than 10,000 Twitter followers.<\/p><p>I would like to refer to the series of festivals and events which are, in many ways, the keystone to the potential success of The Gathering and which help drive and generate demand to visit Ireland.  I am pleased that we have a fantastic line up confirmed for The Gathering.  Details of all of the events are included on The Gathering website and I urge Senators to look at the site to see the variety and spread of events taking place over the next 11 months.  Numbers-wise, as I already said, there are almost 2,800 individual events confirmed but this number continues to grow.  Indeed, I am aware of a large number of gatherings which are not on the website.  They include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events, music and concerts taking place throughout the country all year long.  While many events will be well-established and internationally renowned, others will be new to the festivals scene and will offer a huge variety of contemporary cultural expression.  There will be large scale national festivals and events but there will also be a myriad of local gatherings taking place.<\/p><p>We are also supporting a targeted set of special events for The Gathering, building on our existing strengths in terms of Ireland's image overseas.  An example of this is the very successful new year's event which kicked off The Gathering in Dublin.  These types of events will provide a platform for the best of Irish talent and show off our host cities, towns and villages at their best.  <\/p><p>In terms of resources, a limited amount of funding has been allocated on a once-off basis for existing festivals and events to tailor their programme, or specific elements of their programme, around the themes of The Gathering 2013.  Just over \u20ac4 million is being provided by F\u00e1ilte Ireland to support almost 200 national and regional festivals and events during 2013.  Some \u20ac1 million of this is additional funding has been allocated on a once-off basis for major events to tailor their programme, or specific elements of their programme, around the themes of The Gathering.  Three examples of major events which are being enhanced around The Gathering theme include: the Peoples Parade, which offered up to 8,000 visitors from around the world a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lead and take part in the iconic national St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin in a very special celebration of The Gathering; a gathering of Roses, which will take place at the Rose of Tralee Festival in the summer in Tralee, with 5,000 members of the extended Rose family invited to Tralee, including former Roses, escorts and visitors to the festival; and other established cultural events which are offering enhanced programmes this  year, including the Galway Arts Festival, the Wexford Opera Festival, which is having a conference on European opera, and Listowel Writers' Week.<\/p><p>Outside of the regular F\u00e1ilte Ireland festivals and events budget, an additional \u20ac2 million fund was overseen by the city and county councils to fund The Gathering events and activities.  This scheme was administered by the councils based on agreed application criteria with a key factor being the capacity to attract overseas visitors.  These gatherings, divided into key county flagship events and community gatherings, are funded through a \u20ac1 million philanthropic donation by IPB Insurance that was matched by the Government through F\u00e1ilte Ireland in response to the enormous interest expressed nationwide.  I put on the record my appreciation to IPB Insurance for taking part in and contributing to The Gathering.  Many of us who were members of local authorities will be familiar with what we used to call Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance.  It is the same company and we are very grateful to it for that support.  I hope to be able to work with it in other areas where my Department will interact with local government in the coming years.  Through this programme, co-funded by IPB and F\u00e1ilte Ireland, 1,322 events are being supported and these include 82 county flagship events and 1,240 local community events.  Again, details of these can be found on The Gathering website.<\/p><p>This is just a short overview of what is in store in terms of festivals and events and, obviously, time constraints will not allow me to deal with all of them.  What I will say, however, is that we hear a lot about a desire on the part of tourists for authenticity, for genuine Irish experiences and for a connection with Irish people.  I am delighted that the events and festivals developed for The Gathering by Irish towns, villages and communities, celebrate what they are proud of in their own locality.  I have no doubt that they will provide that genuine local Irish experience and send overseas visitors back with many rich memories.<\/p><p>Obviously, we can only achieve our ambitious targets for overseas visitor numbers if our main source tourism markets are aware of the initiative.  For this reason, Tourism Ireland continues to develop a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to the people across the world who feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland.  The agency's overseas activities are already showing dividends with 20 gatherings confirmed through the agency's overseas partners.  Some examples include: SPAR bringing its international conference to Dublin and Killarney in May, which will involve 280 delegates from 36 countries spending six nights in Ireland; KPMG, the international financial services provider, is hosting its alumni dinner for 2013 in the Convention Centre Dublin with more than 1,000 visitors expected from overseas; and the International Pharmaceutical Federation annual congress will welcome 3,000 pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists from around the world to Dublin in August.  Obviously, the immediate benefits to our economy of hosting these events is enormous.  Equally important, however, is the opportunity to reap a legacy dividend in terms of future holiday plans of those who travel.<\/p><p>In terms of mainstream marketing activity, throughout 2013 Tourism Ireland will continue to undertake co-operative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators.  In Britain, the advertisements to date have mainly featured the good value fares that are now on offer.  Similar activity is under way with all of the airlines serving mainland Europe.  In France, advertising campaigns in partnership with the ferry companies will run in March and April to promote car touring holidays to Ireland during the year of The Gathering.  Of course, as Senators will know, last year was one of the strongest ever for visitors from the US to Ireland and we hope to grow this further in 2013 and make it a record year.  A critical factor which will underpin this growth is the increase of more than 25% in the number of airline seats between Ireland and the US this summer.  Co-operative marketing campaigns with all of these airlines will take place throughout the year.<\/p><p>Print and online advertising will also continue in all our major overseas tourism markets.  In Britain alone, a series of national press advertorials reached 8.2 million in the national press in recent weeks.  In the United States, a 30 second Gathering television advertisement will coincide with the broadcast of the third series of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; reaching 500,000 households in the Chicago, New York and Boston areas every week.  The Gathering is also being highlighted at major European trade and consumer fairs and Tourism Ireland is working in partnership with a number of online travel agents across Europe to promote the initiative.  The St. Patrick's Day festivities and the programme of overseas ministerial events will again be used to publicise Ireland, with the greening of landmarks happening again throughout the world and in Dublin and in all our major towns and cities.  Today, I wrote to all Ministers, county managers, city managers and the CEOs of State companies asking them to turn their landmark buildings green for the week of St. Patrick's Day.  I hope they will answer that call.<\/p> <p>These are just some examples of the overseas promotional activities that are in planning or under way but I think they show that every possible effort is being made to get the message out there that The Gathering is happening and that there has never been a better time to visit.<\/p><p>As I already said, there has been a fantastic response to The Gathering across the board, from local communities, voluntary bodies, public bodies, businesses and Government at national and local level.  I am aware that the initiative has not been without criticism, with certain adverse comments about the event receiving widespread coverage which has, in many ways, helped to raise the profile of The Gathering.  Everyone here would agree that tourism is a valuable service export.  Encouraging those from overseas, whether Irish or not, to sample what we have to offer is not, in my opinion, a money-grabbing exercise, any more than exporting other goods and services.  With the hotel and accommodation sector already generating additional employment since this Government came into office, with roughly 10,000 more people working in tourism, accommodation and hospitality than at the time of the general election, tourism can offer jobs to those who might otherwise face a choice between emigration and unemployment.  I am certainly not ashamed of seeking to increase that employment still further by investing in The Gathering.<\/p><p>The New Year's Eve event in Dublin was fabulous and is something that will develop every year, getting bigger and better.  Perhaps in ten years Dublin will rival Edinburgh and New York as a place to visit for New Year's Eve.  I am really delighted to see many local festivals across the country that had fallen by the wayside being re-ignited.  One such festival in my own constituency is the Strawberry Fair in the Strawberry Beds.  Members may remember that the late Deputy Brian Lenihan used to live in the Strawberry Beds, between Lucan and Castleknock.  I remember going to the Strawberry Fair as a young child but somehow it petered out over the years.  As part of The Gathering, however, someone had the bright idea of starting the festival again, which will take place on 30 June this year.  It is really nice to see some of those festivals around the country that died off being re-ignited.  The Gathering, in many ways, has given people an excuse to do things that they had planned to do, whether that be a festival or a family reunion, but never got around to before.  <\/p><p>The Gathering will also be important in terms of re-establishing connections, particularly among the second-generation diaspora.  I have organised my family gathering and descendents of my great great grandfather, Tom Howell, a shoemaker from Kilbrien in County Waterford, are coming to our family gathering in Dungarvan in May.  We have people coming from America, all over Ireland and the UK.  It is an opportunity for a lot of us to get to know one another in a way we did not in the past, to reunite families and enable people to get to know the next generation that is coming along.  Often, when emigration happens, people keep in touch for a generation or two but that link is lost after a third or fourth generation.  This is an opportunity to introduce people to different generations and to remake those family connections which are very important.<\/p><p>I should also state that I firmly believe that anybody coming to Ireland this year, be it specifically for The Gathering or otherwise, will not be disappointed.  If there is any doubt, early results from the latest visitor attitude survey commissioned by F\u00e1ilte Ireland makes for very encouraging reading.  In 2012, 65% of those surveyed said they would highly recommend Ireland to their friends to visit and a further 32% would recommend Ireland.  Furthermore, 61% plan to return in the next few years and a massive 97% would like to return again in the future.  This shows that we already have a very stable tourism product that people enjoy and one that can deliver a vibrant sustainable tourism industry in the future.<\/p><p>It is also widely accepted that value for money has improved in Ireland.  Prices here have fallen, in general, over the last couple of years while they have risen across most of the rest of western Europe.  Restaurants, hotels and attractions are offering much better packages to holidaymakers than they did in the past and all of that augurs very well for the future of Irish tourism.<\/p><p>As I am in the Seanad, I wish to make special mention of Senator Eamonn Coghlan, my party and constituency colleague, who is organising the Senator's Cup event, which is a golfing tournament, only open to people from overseas, who will come to play golf in the Luttrellstown Castle Golf Club and the Royal Dublin Golf Club.  That promises to be a great event and it is good to see somebody really taking an interest in The Gathering.  Another event, about which I have spoken to the Ceann Comhairle and on which some moves are afoot, is a parliamentary or Oireachtas gathering, which may happen next autumn.  That would be a gathering of parliamentarians of Irish heritage, many of whom we would have met on visits abroad.  We probably said to ourselves we should meet again but never did.  This would be an opportunity to invite parliamentarians from overseas who have Irish heritage to these Houses.  The Ceann Comhairle will chair a committee which will make that a reality and the Whips have been asked to submit two names to be part of the working group, preferably one Deputy and one Senator because it is very important to have this House involved.<\/p><p>I hope I have given the House an overview of The Gathering Ireland 2013.  While we have very much targeted this year, I have no doubt that the pay-off for participation will have long-term positive consequences.  The many events which are offering unique and engaging experiences to visitors, may develop into annual traditions or create ongoing connections with other parts of the world.  More important, the connections we strengthen and build, at home and abroad, will be the most important legacy of The Gathering Ireland 2013.  I look forward to the contributions from Senators on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100010#J00400","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359633600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.

Molaim an obair at\u00e1 idir l\u00e1imhe ag an Aire.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on the implementation of his portfolio.  He comes across to me as a no-nonsense, straight talking Minister who avoids acrimonious debates.  I have noticed that on television and in other fora and believe it is particularly important at a time when there is a lot of negativity abroad.  I compliment the Minister on that.  I have also discovered that important people are descended from shoemakers.  For instance, President Obama's ancestor was also a shoemaker in Moneygall.  The Minister and the President have a lot in common.<\/p><p>The Irish people, as we know, have travelled for centuries throughout the world and those of us who have been fortunate to meet them on different occasions in different parts of the world realise the love that they still have for their homeland.  Every opportunity they get, they want to help Ireland.  We should not spend too much time with any of the negative comments that were made about The Gathering.  They were really very peripheral and were not very serious.  Unfortunately, however, these things gather legs and they end up in the international media.  The Irish were misrepresented in those negative comments.  The suggestion that we only go to the diaspora on St. Patrick's Day or that we only come with a begging bowl is absolute nonsense.  The network that has been established between Ireland - including official agencies, voluntary bodies, community organisations and so forth - and the Irish diaspora is very strong and visionary.  There is no doubt that there is a huge foundation of co-operation in existence.  The comments were a misrepresentation of the situation as it stands.<\/p><p>The Gathering has an echo in An T\u00f3stal and those of us of a certain age can remember back to that series of festivals.  I think I was about 13 or 14 at the time that we had a huge event in the town of Cashel.  I can remember the huge cultural parade and I had the role of an acolyte in it.  I recall it being on newsreel in the cinema, as happened at that particular time.  The cinema in Cashel was packed on the occasion and I went up to see myself.  I think I saw myself for a half a second but nevertheless, it was my hour of glory.  The positivity which came out of An T\u00f3stal at that time was unique.  I am sure that when Senator Paschal Mooney arrives to speak he will refer to the fact that An T\u00f3stal still continues in one town, Drumshambo in County Leitrim, to this very day.  I always regretted that it did not continue and that is why I know The Gathering is going to succeed.  I do not have any doubt about that.  <\/p> <p>It will succeed because the Irish are good at a number of things, including presenting a party, which is what The Gathering will be.  It provides an opportunity for people, not only in the large populated cities and towns but in the villages and townlands, to come out and nail their colours to the mast and show themselves as they are, namely, communities wishing to welcome back the broader family of Ireland.  When one considers that there are 70,000 people of Irish extraction throughout the world, this is unique.  That is, however, only a small part of the story.  The influence and impact of the Irish diaspora in their adopted countries is also unique.  <\/p><p>When the organisation with which I am connected, Comhaltas Ceoltoir\u00ed \u00c9ireann, received an application five or six years from Moscow regarding the formation of a branch in Russia and we inquired who were the Irish people involved we learned those involved were Russian and not Irish people.  The secretary of that branch is Yuri, an Irish speaking Russian.  Comhaltas Ceoltoir\u00ed \u00c9ireann has branches in 15 countries on four continents.  During the past three months two new branches were opened in Argentina and Chile and another was opened in Bogota, Colombia, with a second to follow.  We must have something very special that appeals to other nationalities that they want to embrace it, participate in it and celebrate it.  I do not know how one puts a price on an asset of that type, which is not commercial but has economic consequences.  <\/p><p>I have previously heard sections of the media comment badly on representatives of the Irish Government going abroad for St. Patrick's Day.  Sadly, not only were the representatives of Government pilloried, so too were our people abroad who wanted to indicate with pride the connection they had with our country.  Three years ago, I had the pleasure of being the guest of honour at the parade in St. Louis, although not on behalf of Government.  Prior to that parade 12,000 people, wearing green jerseys, came together for a sponsored race.  Some 300,000 people turned up at that parade.  The sight of Irish people showing off their Irishness was unique.  There must be an end to people saying Irish Government representatives should not be going abroad because of the expense involved and more focus on the amount of money that is generated through their appearance on television and in the newspapers, which is all good publicity.  The Gathering, through the bringing together of cultural, industrial and community Ireland, will also be good publicity.  We have a unique story to tell and a unique product to market.  <\/p><p>The Gathering is off to a good start.  I wish those involved well.  I have no doubt that it will leave behind a legacy of positivity and ideas with which we can work into the future.  We must take this opportunity to work together for the common cause.  I hope, however, that this does not stop at the Border.  For the first time in 60 years Fleadh Cheoil na h\u00c9ireann will be held across the Border.  It will be attended by 300,000 people and will generate \u20ac40 million.  That it is being held on the other side of the Border must be of interest to Tourism Ireland, which markets all of Ireland.   I salute F\u00e1ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland who have done an outstanding job against all the odds down through the years.  This is the time for Ireland to shine.  Let The Gathering be the unifying element we needed in this time of recession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100012#L00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359634200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>The Gathering Ireland 2013 is the biggest tourism event ever to be held in Ireland.

These responses range from family gatherings to school and college reunions, and even a gathering of twins.  Like the Minister I, too, congratulate Senator Eamonn Coghlan on his initiative, through which he is encouraging participation from broad in a golf tournament at two of the most magnificent golf courses in this country, to which I understand there has been a great response.

The Gathering will showcase Ireland at its best.  Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa mentioned An T\u00f3stal which takes place in Drumshanbo and commenced in 1952, which, if the Minister does not mind my saying, was before he was born.

I am interested in The Gathering.  Like Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, I have a keen interest in issues of family history and ancestry.  I am connected with many organisations around the world.  I spent my summer holidays in Wisconsin tracing three generations of women who went to a small town there.  Interestingly, Vice President Joe Biden also had ancestors who were shoemakers.  His left within weeks of President Obama's.  They have a shared story within their ancestries.<\/p><p>The Gathering is generating a great deal of discussion and is positive towards people's ideas.  There is a feeling of hope and personal involvement.  As the Minister stressed, each of us must take the initiative within our communities.  When I first heard about The Gathering, I wondered whether it was a case of smoke and mirrors.  I do not care if it is as long as it works, brings people to Ireland and gets us all involved.  The magic of the initiative is that it will be up to us.  The Minister outlined the initiative's momentum.  Having listened to each of my colleagues, I do not doubt that we will share the ideas and concepts that we are seeking to promote.<\/p><p>The Minister stressed the importance of The Gathering not being done by the Government and the need for everyone to be involved.  It is about the use and credibility of the brand.  I received an invitation recently and although I will not give the details, this is an issue about the use of the State's branding by a commercial company that is not based in Ireland and is in the business of making profit.  Perhaps the Minister can allay my concerns about who can use the brand and how.  I welcome all of the initiatives, but they should not be organised by such companies.  This is not what The Gathering is about.  Instead, The Gathering is about challenging each of us.  I have challenged myself with learning my ancestry networks.  I have connected with those to try to encourage events.<\/p><p>I am also the chair of Early Childhood Ireland, which wondered what part it could play in The Gathering, if any.  I am delighted that the Minister will help us to launch our invitations.  We are organising a global gathering on early childhood in October.  We plan to have 600 plus participants, the majority of whom will come from Ireland, in a four-day event at the Aviva Stadium to discuss early childhood.  We expect significant attendance levels from the US, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, but we are sending the invitations worldwide.  Our idea is generating considerable interest and we are attracting significant speakers on the issue of early childhood.  Ireland is an interesting place because we are changing and developing our policies on early childhood.  This is just another type of initiative that each of us can consider in determining where our responsibility lies and how we can make The Gathering work.<\/p><p>I am behind The Gathering full square and I will help in any way to make it work.  It is in everyone's interests.  As with Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa's mention of previous events, we can look back on The Gathering and be proud.  We must regain our momentum for this and successive years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100014#N00600","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1359634800,"counter":199,"content":"<\/a> <p>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome this opportunity to discuss a positive, spirit-lifting initiative that we can all support.  It does not matter whether we are shoemakers or interested in our ancestries.  Unfortunately, I cannot raise a story about shoes to match the others.<\/p><p>The beauty of The Gathering is that it will be built as we go and as people discover new interests and where they can play to their strengths.  For example, Senator van Turnhout referred to inviting people from around the world who are interested in early learning.  She might not have thought of doing so had The Gathering not been started.  The Gathering is a large umbrella under which any number of interesting and peculiar initiatives might be held during the year.<\/p><p>I will pay tribute to the Minister for printing his speech on this paper.  It may not be known that people who suffer from dyslexia are recommended to read from paper that is not white.  This is the first time that I have seen any Department offer a speech that is not on white paper.  Perhaps we might all take a leaf out of the Minister's book and ask for this paper to be used in future.<\/p><p>I will also pay tribute to Comhaltas Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed \u00c9ireann.  I might say that, being from Sligo, which has just won the bid on the 2014 fleadh.  I am most grateful to Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa and his colleagues.  In my correspondence to the ardcomhairle, I referred to how the organisation protected the fleadh and kept it afloat even when doing so was difficult.  Comhaltas Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed \u00c9ireann always understood that it was precious.  It has the authentic feel to which the Minister referred.  When people want to enjoy their experience in Ireland, they feel like they have dirtied their hands - in the broadest sense of that phrase - with the fleadh, in that they have connected with real people.  The fleadh is a fine example of how to do that.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, with whom I do not always agree on political points.  His many years of dedication and commitment to the work of Comhaltas Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed \u00c9ireann are seen on large occasions.<\/p> <p>It is seen certainly where I live in the enormous enthusiasm of young people have for playing and enjoying music in their own homes.  I attended an event over Christmas where people were playing music in their own home for pleasure, they were aged from 12 to 25 and were having a good time playing traditional music.  That is what the Senator has worked to achieve and he has achieved it and is continuing to do so.  It is good to hear that the Russians and the Argentinians do not want to miss out on it.<\/p><p>I would like to refer to my great uncle Thomas Cooper, to whom I have referred previously in the House.  He was the man who made the first film in Ireland, &quot;The Dawn&quot;.  He was less known in other parts of the country, apart from in Killarney where he was known by the people.  I am sorry to advise Senator Brennan that Killarney would claim to be main place of tourism in Ireland but I am sure Carlingford is probably a very close second.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100014#N00700","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359635400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>It is ahead of Killarney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100015#O00200","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1359635400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>It is ahead of it.  It will allow the Senator that for the moment.  My great uncle Tom Cooper took the idea underpinning The Gathering to heart many moons ago.  He published his own brochures, took the ferry to England, travelled all around northern England and handed them out.  That was in the days when there was no e-mail and very little technology.  He organised for a bus to collect tourists from the boat in Dublin, drive them to Kerry where they were looked after in his hotel for two weeks and for the bus to bring them back to Dublin.  He understood very early on the concept of The Gathering and that it was up to individuals to publish brochures, take the ferry to England and gather in the tourists.  Fortunately, we can do it on a grander scale now.  It is probably something we all have in our genes; we know about the need to bring people here.<\/p><p>When I first heard about The Gathering and read about the various festivals I thought it was a competition for rather peculiar names for events such as the pirates and slaves unite, the billabong big wave, Paddy McGinty's boat and the hedge school.  I began to wonder what on earth was going on but in a way I love that idea.  It is a terribly creative concept.  Perhaps the most oddly named one is the Scattering Gathering, which transpires to be a visual arts exhibition in Waterford to remember those people who have emigrated from Ireland over many years and to celebrate those who have come to settle in Ireland.  We also gather people from other places.  In that way The Gathering has sparked our great Irish imagination in terms of activities across the board ranging from walking, surfing, cycling, bodhr\u00e1ns, flutes, storytelling, soccer, the GAA, film, poker, food, piping and drumming, police officers gatherings, bangers and barges.  I am disappointed there is no jam making event and I am very surprised somebody has not come up with the idea of poit\u00edn making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100015#O00300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1359635400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>We will have it in Carlingford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100015#O00400","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1359635400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>They will have it in Carlingford.   The Minister will have to go to it but there will be no poit\u00edn for him while he is working.<\/p><p>I might take a parochial leaf out of the Minister's book - he will have been invited to every country in Ireland by the time he leaves the House - and point out that in Sligo we will climb Ben Bulben and Knocknarea, play music in the Coleman Centre, have sea shanties in Rosses Point, we will have the Celtic Fringe Festival - we have our twin events as well - and most of all we have William Butler Yeats.  I could not possibly fail to mention him.  The Minister's Department has been very generous in its understanding of how we would like to reconnect with Yeats.  As the Minister will know, I have a very deep interest in that, having launched Yeats Day last year.  I have been working very closely with Jim Miley and The Gathering to create a bigger event, a poetic and literary event, which would celebrate the idea of coming home.  The very strength of the two words &quot;coming home&quot; when one says them has an extraordinary resonance for people.  When one says &quot;I am coming home&quot;, it means something much different from other things one does in one's  life.  I am very keen to make that work.<\/p><p>The great strength of The Gathering is that it reminds us not only of our vast heritage and modern vibrancy but of our capacity to harness our energy and creativity, to pull together and put on a year-long celebration of what it means to be Irish and what it means to understand our roots, our past, our history and our people.  It reminds us of our great c\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte tradition, which we ensure we do not lose in these modern times when people are much more brash, sharp and everything is quick and hurried and we do not have much time.  The c\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte tradition is what is and what always was authentic here and what people still expect when they come here.  We should celebrate that and remember we can be a little more laid back as that is what was always strong about Ireland.<\/p><p>I want to finish by referring to two events.  There will be a gathering event in Limerick called &quot;Recruit and Mobilise&quot;.  It is not an event one would draw out at a first glance of the events.  It involves a group coming from the US to work with the local rape crisis group to complete work on its new building.  The Minister will know this is the start of the area of volunteer tourism - I can never easily say that term, it is a mash-up term.  There is a big growth in this area.  I would love to see the Minister's Department supporting that through a particular initiative, perhaps through F\u00e1ilte Ireland.  The Irish volunteer spirit is very strong.  Leitrim takes the lead in that in terms of the number of volunteers but we are all volunteers in Ireland.  Therefore, we would be able to reach out to other countries in the world and develop a very strong volunteer tourism industry, of course, underpinned ethically.<\/p><p>Can the Minister outline what will happen in 2014 and beyond?  The Gathering has been a great umbrella and it is a great initiative.  I will do everything I can to assist and I particularly want to acknowledge Jim Miley's work in this area.  I know that sustainable projects are part of this.  I am not suggesting it has to keep going in the same guise but what is the Minister's goal or dream for what The Gathering could be as we continue on?  I hope the many initiatives that have started will continue.  I thank those locally and nationally who have got the finger out and said &quot;Let us get up and do this and let us have a good time&quot;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100015#O00500","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1359635400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and it is always a pleasure when he comes to see us.  I will not make any remarks about the descendants of shoemakers trying to cobble together some economic policies or anything like that.  I note one of his critics in a subsequent television role became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  We should ask him to resume his support for The Gathering and I hope he will continue to do that.  The fact that Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa was able to deliver a major event to Senator O'Keeffe's area proves the power of the Seanad and that useful information should be conveyed any place the Minster might be discussing the future of the Seanad.<\/p><p>I look forward to the Strawberry Beds Festival, where we will meet in honour of the late Brian Lenihan.  I attended the Carlingford Festival on one occasion but I cannot remember meeting Senator Brennan at it.  I was canvassing there before the election.  There was an excellent commemoration of Thomas D'Arcy McGee, one of the founders of Canada, who came from Carlingford.  There is obviously a connection there.<\/p><p>I very much welcome that the Minister on page 1 of his speech referred to lower VAT and PRSI rates.  That is most important because tourism is about price and product, and I will give the Minister evidence of where we ran into problems in that respect later.  He referred to legacy issues.  He has inherited a pretty unattractive brief because in the Celtic tiger era Irish tourism priced itself out of markets.  The Gathering can only do a certain amount to try to restore our reputation and I will talk about that later.  Tourism promotion in Ireland exhibits another characteristic of how we got ourselves into trouble in the Celtic tiger era, namely, the problem of bureaucracy, and I will also talk about that.  Trying to correct some of that, to which the Minister referred on page 1 of his speech, is most important and I commend the Government.  People's visits to this country must be of good value.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned on page 7 of his speech the contribution by IPB, an insurance company.  The tourism industry got itself into trouble before.  I remember being at an event in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham when John Bruton appointed me director of Bord F\u00e1ilte.  At the event Mr. Colm McCarthy, a well-known economist and scribe, said to the hoteliers gathered that if somebody stays in their hotels they get to keep the money.  He said to them, therefore, that they should not always be demanding that the Government promotes tourism.  He added it is called &quot;capitalism&quot; in case some of the hoteliers and others in the tourism industry did not understand it.  The fact that an insurance company sees the benefit of this is a wake up call for some of the people in the industry.  Concerns were expressed at that meeting that sometimes we are better at promoting Irish hoteliers going to Chicago at taxpayers' expense when the object was to get the Chicagoans to come here.<\/p> <p>Some of that expenditure gave the industry a bad name and made it substantially reliant on hand outs from the Government.<\/p><p>Good value air fares on north American routes are most important and I am pleased with the new arrangement at Shannon Airport introduced by the Minster and his colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The airport priced itself out of the market.  Officials there increased charges by approximately 700% and lost a great deal of business.  I acknowledge the problems with debt and productivity and so on.  Cork Airport should be deal with similarly.  The decision by the Minister's predecessor to order the regulator to increase landing charges at Dublin Airport was short-sighted.  We need the co-operation of airlines to come to Ireland and overcharging them at airports was silly on the part of many of the Minister's predecessors.  It is important to remedy these faults.  I support the Minister regarding The Gathering but there is evidence that tourism is not about once off gimmicks.  For example, the Homecoming in Scotland has its critics while the holding of the Olympics n London may have resulted in a reduction in tourism activity.<\/p><p>I refer to the problems we face.  Our wonderful research service put together some of the numbers prior to us discussing the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill last year.  Between 2000 and 2009, the number of tourists who visited Ireland who thought we were fair, poor or very poor value for money increased from 39% to 71% while the number who thought we were good value reduced from 39% to 25% or very good value reduced from 23% to 3%.  Tourism is about price and product.  We priced ourselves out of the market and F\u00e1ilte Ireland is aware of this because I am quoting its data.<\/p><p>Airlines have largely dispensed with expensive downtown offices.  There was a time when Grafton Street, the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9e and the equivalent street in London were populated by airline offices.  Have tourism bodies moved with the time?  Airlines have largely dispensed with advertising literature and have moved everything online.  Are the tourism bodies keeping abreast of that?  We have the bureaucracy problem and the cost problem.<\/p><p>I commend those who kept Irish tourism going during the Celtic tiger era when everybody wanted to be an auctioneer, a conveyancing solicitor or a bureaucrat. The people who kept tourism going were those who came to Ireland from eastern Europe.  We were too arrogant to be bothered with tourism and the Kerry accent disappeared from a large number of Kerry hotels but, happily, these people kept the industry going and we now have a better sense of perspective on these matters.  We cannot neglect an industry, as we did shamefully, over ten years and expect to revive it overnight.<\/p><p>On the issue of the cost base, I question the way the then Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport, as it was configured before the Minister took office, regulated the sector.  The Exchequer lost approximately \u20ac1 billion in revenue through foreign exchange from a peak of \u20ac4.9 billion in 2007 down to \u20ac3.9 billion in 2009.  During those three years, \u20ac492 million was spent feeding the tourism bureaucracy comprising \u20ac310 million in operating expenses or 63% of the budget of Tourism Ireland and F\u00e1ilte Ireland.  What kind of bureaucracy to promote Ireland spends 63% of its funding on itself?  A total of \u20ac154 million was expended on marketing, which was approximately one third of the budget, at a time tourist numbers reduced.  Does anybody in those organisations stay up late at night wondering how they spent so much money to reduce the number of visitors to Ireland?  They have a great deal to answer for and part of what the Government was elected to do was to reform bureaucracy.  I hope the Minister is asking them plenty of hard questions as to how such a marketing budget was mostly spent on themselves.  They did not evaluate the marketing nor did they move with industry trends.  It comes down to price and product at the end of the day and that is where we have been doing badly but I commend the Government parties on their attempts to correct that.  I do not want us to be disillusioned this time next year. <\/p><p>I wish The Gathering every success but there are serious product and bureaucratic problems with the way Ireland has promoted itself as a tourist destination.  Sometimes taking second-hand remedies from other countries may not be the best resort.  We need to improve the product and reduce the price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100015#O00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359636000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Like him, I acknowledge that tourism has been an important driver of the economy, especially in tougher times and I welcome the increase in the number of visitors to the island in both 2011 and 2012.  This improvement will surely accelerate this year and The Gathering will be central to that.  The early signs are positive with one tangible measure being the increase in the number of seats sold on flights from the US to Ireland and a 34% increase in seats sold on flights from Abu Dhabi.  That indicates higher demand, which is welcome.<\/p><p>  As with all sectors, as Senator Barrett said, there is room for improvement.  The UNWTO estimates that international tourism receipts in Ireland hit &#8364;4.64 billion in 2011, up from &#8364;4 billion in 2010.  It is a great deal of money and a testament to the work of the Department.  However, in an international study, Australia, which may not be a fair comparison, recorded 5.8 million international visitors, which was fewer than Ireland, yet the receipts were &#8364;31.4 billion, seven times more than Ireland.  This reflects the fact that people spend more time in Australia than in Ireland due to the size of the country and the distance required to travel there.  Initiatives such as the American football game that was played in Dublin last year attract high quality tourists who will spend extensive time in the country.  We must find a way to keep people in the country rather than attracting them to Dublin at weekends for stag and hen parties.  That is a significant element of the tourist numbers.  In Ireland, the <i>per capita <\/i>spend was &#8364;718 while it was &#8364;5,143 in Australia and &#8364;1,714 in Israel.  Comparisons are odious in many ways but it is illustrative of the fact that we should try to keep tourists in the country for longer durations.  I am sure the Minister will be more than aware of that.<\/p><p>  The Gathering marks an important year for the tourism industry and it presents great scope for our entrepreneurs and those with the gift of the gab to get people to come home to Ireland or to visit for the first time.  As previous speakers said, there are many good and novel ideas and a number have caught my attention.  In Cork, people are working on reuniting the &quot;Leeaspora&quot; during Cork Rebel Week while in Crosshaven, there will be a ginger gathering.  There is an annual ginger festival in the town but they are holding a ginger gathering this year to reach out to gingers everywhere.  Senator Burke referred to a natural red head in his area but I should point out to him in no uncertain terms that I am a natural ginger as well.  Claremorris, where I grew up, is holding a smaller gathering to get people who lived in the area to come together and I am looking forward to that.<\/p><p>  It is important that The Gathering be embraced in the commercial space.  For instance, Guinness has launched its ambassador programme for The Gathering, which allows native Dubliners to get a Guinness ambassador card giving them free access to the Guinness Storehouse while giving their gatherees 10% off.<\/p> <p>It is a nice idea and one where a smaller gathering might be framed.  It would be great if, where possible, other businesses got on board in such a way.  Business will also play another important role for The Gathering in enticing annual conferences to come to Ireland.  This is something which happens on an ongoing basis and The Gathering further bolsters the opportunity for people trying to get conferences to Ireland.  Beyond that, The Gathering is, as the Minister said, about Ireland and its global network building on its relationships, not only in economic terms but in community and connection.  For my part, I am involved in the committee the Minister mentioned which was proposed by Senator Mark Daly, the aim of which was to get politicians to come to the Seanad.<\/p><p>People coming to Ireland for The Gathering will not be disappointed.  Although the visitors attitude survey certainly showed room for improvement, many guides, including Fodors travel guide, have shown it as a place to visit.  There is much more I wanted to say.  The VAT reduction has been instrumental.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department who have worked hard on the issue.  We are enthusiastic about it and will promote it as much as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100016#P00200","speaker":"1153","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359636600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>T\u00e1 c\u00e9ad f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.

I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on this initiative which is positive and valuable and merits discussion to see how we can improve it.  Sinn F\u00e9in supports any measure to boost domestic tourism which it hopes will lead to increased employment in the sector and, in so far as The Gathering may do so, it is a positive initiative.  We hope that the Irish people and the diaspora respond positively.  It has the potential to add to the several million tourists who arrive here each year and we hope it can prove a boost to the economy.  However, it should be more than about monetary issues and it should bring the nation closer together as a people, whether abroad or at home, North or South.  We are all part of the Irish nation and I hope that this year will offer an opportunity to reflect on that and to enjoy the rich cultural heritage, be it linguistic, literary, artistic, sporting, etc.  We need to consider ways in which we can better value the role of the diaspora in Irish life, a point to which I will return later.<\/p><p>I note the event is happening at a particularly difficult time for the people.  Perhaps it is needed in such a context but we should be cognisant of the current situation.  Someone noted that just as 2013 has been promoted as the year of The Gathering of the diaspora coming home and making a connection once again with Ireland, it has also been called the scattering.  I do not wish to be churlish and I do not dispute the value of the exercise but it would take wilful blindness not to recognise that there are thousands of Irish citizens being forced every day to emigrate for work reasons.  It is a different debate but the aim of bringing them home and keeping them here must always be in our consideration.<\/p><p>It is right and proper that we would seek to make the diaspora welcome and encourage them to come home and participate in the events that are being organised, be they family, local or national.  We share the concerns expressed by Gabriel Byrne regarding Irish emigrants, especially those who have left Ireland due to economic need and the way in which they are treated.<\/p><p>In August 2012, Sinn F\u00e9in's finance spokesperson, Deputy Pearse Doherty, visited Australia specifically to engage with the Irish community there.  Successive Irish Governments have ignored the plight of the Irish abroad.  This is particularly the case with regard to the undocumented Irish in the US and Australia.  However, we must do more for the diaspora in the long term to include them in the life of the island.  We need to do more to ensure they have a voice in the way we govern ourselves to feel as if they have a stake in the nation.  We need to find better ways of including them.  The most obvious way is to offer certain voting rights for the Irish abroad, subject to reasonable qualifications.  Many have left because they felt they had no option but to emigrate to seek employment and would very much like to come home and would be likely have it as their aim to return eventually.  If they intend to return, why should they not have a say in the island to which they are returning?<\/p><p>There is a need for The Gathering to be promoted, as mentioned by Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, as an all-Ireland initiative.  Sinn F\u00e9in has raised the matter previously and I understand that my colleague, Elisha McLaughlin, MLA has met the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, on the matter.  I understand the Minister of State shares our view that this should be an all-Ireland initiative.  However, the Minister, Arlene Foster, MLA, is not of the same view.  That is regrettable.  A failure in the North to capitalise on the tourism opportunity provided by the Irish Government's promotion of The Gathering would be unbelievably short-sighted.  None the less, I urge the Minister to persevere with the Minister with responsibility for tourism in the North.  We will certainly do our part to lend support.<\/p><p>There is much happening in the North this year, the City of Culture in Derry all year as well as Fleadh Cheoil na h\u00c9ireann.  These are the two of the biggest events and they need to be part of The Gathering.  Tourism Ireland is the obvious body to work on this issue.  I encourage the Minister to continue to work on this as an all-Ireland project and perhaps he can provide an update as to what progress has been made in this regard.<\/p><p>In terms of specific projects there is huge potential in language tourism.  I have raised this point previously.  Language tourism is an area which is under-exploited and we should seek to use this opportunity to expand on it in the State.

We will have chairpersons of all the energy committees and energy spokespersons from every party here.  It will be held in the Seanad Chamber, organised by Senator Cummins and me.  The dinner will be held here.  We need help to get it organised because it is a Seanad event.  We need to get the people in power to help us out.  Senator Cummins and I have been working on it since last July but we need somebody to take hold of it from the ministerial aspect and the Minister might do that for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100017#Q00600","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359637200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate and I welcome the Minister, who is clear and efficient, and prepared to take practical measures.  One aspect that needs to be emphasised and has been emphasised by other speakers, particularly Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, is the cultural dimension because cultural tourism is one of the most important drivers of the tourism industry.  I am not downplaying golf, even though it is a game in which I have very little interest, and it is a very big earner.  However, it would be a pity if this island were turned into one enormous golf course.  We have quite enough of them already with a fair amount of support from various groups.<\/p><p>I am not prepared to be cynical about The Gathering, but we also need to be clear-headed.  I do not agree with those who appeared to give the impression in the earlier part of the debate that it does not matter, that it is smoke and mirrors and as long as we get the people here that is all we need.  Perhaps I misunderstood it because there is that view and I thought it was reflected here.  It does matter because we must give them a good experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100018#R00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359637200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100018#R00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1359637200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>One of the most important aspects of tourism is repeat business.  We will not get repeat business if our attitude is clearly seen as being callous and exploitative.  We should ask not just what they can do for us but also what we can do for them.  Our history is not always good in this regard.  I had long correspondence, as many other Members of both Houses will have had, with people in Argentina, where there is a very strong Irish connection.  A large number of people live all around Argentina, but very concentrated in Buenos Aires, where they have their own newspaper, <i>The Southern Star<\/i>.  Many people have a very sentimental connection.  As I am sure the Minister knows, if one goes to Buenos Aires or anywhere in Argentina, one will meet Irish people whose families have been there for more than 100 years.  They speak classical Spanish beautifully and when they speak in English they have Westmeath or Wexford accents.  That is how strong the connection is.  However, when they wanted to get a connection here in terms of some little certificate to prove their Irish ancestry or Irish citizenship through grandparents or something, we just rebuffed them.  We were just not interested and they were very badly hurt.  So I believe we need to treat these people with the maximum respect and give them the best we possibly can in terms of experience.<\/p><p>  We need to think outside the box.  We need to think what we could do really well.  As a consumer, I think farmhouse holidays are wonderful.  They are the best value one can get and one gets really good produce as well as getting to see the Irish landscape and so on.  We also have the festivals, including some of the most significant such as the Wexford Opera Festival the Minister mentioned.  It was started by amateurs, motivated by a love of the culture and is now international.  Nobody thought a small fishing town, Wexford, would produce this international thing but the people there saw a niche market for operas by famous composers that were rarely produced.  It is absolutely wonderful.<\/p><p>  There is also the important question of heritage - the built part of the environment.  The Minister needs to talk to his colleagues about the property tax.  What will we do to the great houses of Ireland - the few that are left - if we assess them for property tax?  It will destroy them.  We have done this before and we have very little left there.  For instance, Birr Castle not only has the magnificent architecture and the beautiful parkland but also the contribution to science that we never plug.  We need to bring scientists here and tell them we have imagination.  That is what characterises us as a people and it is not just in culture, but also in the sciences.  We had the largest telescope in the world for many years and invented the steam turbine.  That is just one family and one house.  The property tax could crucify these people and those houses will not have the same interest unless the people are living there.<\/p><p>  The Minister indicated this - I am not sure whether it was done consciously.  In America they deliberately placed the television advertisement during &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; because that is what the Americans are interested in.  We need to have that product there for them.  People who have spent a lot of time in list 1 houses should not be punished as they were in the British days for improving their property.  We had the Queen's visit, the Eurovision and the visit by President Obama, where we placed immensely valuable television images.  It is important that we do that.  I would not write off any of these things.  Advertising is very significant.<\/p><p>  On genealogy, Laois will host the Fitzpatrick clan rally in July.  These are very important as we are all part of a tribe and we should use clan rallies.  I salute the Minister for what he had to say.<\/p><p>  I wish to speak briefly about James Joyce.  A Government-appointed representative told us that the James Joyce Centre could not survive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100018#R00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359637200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100018#R00500","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1359637200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Our figures have increased by 14% over previous year, which also had an increase.

Universities in the United States have a system whereby in every class year one person is appointed to keep track of 14 other people in the class.  That person's job is to follow them and relate back information to the university on an annual basis as to where those 14 are now working.  It works very effectively there but I am not sure if we have the same system in Ireland.  When our graduates leave university there is a huge disconnect and we should work on that.  In some universities in the United States, graduates pay the university $100 for the first ten years after leaving, which goes into research and development of the university.  In the second ten years they pay $500 a year and in the third ten years they pay approximately $1,000.  While it varies from university to university people have a great sense of pride in keeping in contact with their universities.  I do not believe our universities are doing enough in that area.  It is a huge system of connection that people maintain with their university, city and country.  It is something we should try to develop within our universities.<\/p><p>There is such support in UCC.  For instance I know of a person working in a university.  She goes to the United States for the three weeks leading up to St. Patrick's Day and she does all the Irish functions.  UCC is very lucky in having received approximately \u20ac87 million in donations and gifts to the university, which have helped them to develop further facilities.<\/p> <p>That is something that we should grow out of The Gathering.<\/p><p>I want to touch on the use of established names.  The message was sent home clearly to me recently when I contacted a friend who works in a lawyer's office in New York and spoke to her about the golf classic being organised by Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  At first, there was not an enthusiastic reaction to it.  This person is involved in the Cork society in New York.  Once I mentioned the name of Senator Eamonn Coghlan, the attitude totally changed.  We need to use established names, such as the Senator.  There is a considerable number who are world-recognised names in promoting events.   It is something we should take on board.<\/p><p>We need to work on selling the concept that there are significant connections from Ireland right around the world and established organisations, such as the different county societies in different cities around the United States.  Even in China, there are associations being set up.  There are GAA clubs in China and we also need to make contact with them to ensure they are kept informed about what is happening.<\/p><p>We can make this a major success.  Much work has been done already but we have much more to do.  I was Lord Mayor leading into the year when Cork city was the European capital of culture.  We put a great deal of planning into it, but we could have done much more by using those who already had a connection with Cork.  We relied too much on a small number of people.  This will be a success if we have the maximum number of people involved.  Going back to the university point, we need to look at medical organisations, accountancy organisations and architects' organisations, because they have worldwide connections, and use them much more to promote this event.  Much work has been done, but we have a great deal more to do.  It will be a success but we all have a part to play, even by making that one telephone call or sending that one letter.  It all adds up.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for the work he and the Department have done to date and I wish him every success for the remainder of the year on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100018#R01000","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359637800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and echo the positive comments that have been made about his progressing and promoting of The Gathering initiative which has been several years in gestation.  I hope the early indications are positive in that regard.  It is early - only one month into the year - but perhaps he might provide an update.  He has gone into some considerable detail about what will happen over the next year but he might give some indication of the sentiment that is out there and how he has experienced that in the first month of The Gathering year.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and thank my colleagues on both sides of the House, including my friends, Senators \u00d3 Murch\u00fa and Brennan, for making reference to the T\u00f3stal festival in Drumshanbo which was, perhaps, the first national initiative undertaken in the early 1950s to encourage the then focus on the Irish in America.  An T\u00f3stal, which, literally translated, means muster or pageant, resulted in the setting up of T\u00f3stal councils across Ireland with the theme of Ireland at home.  The theme that was encouraged by the local T\u00f3stal councils was to reflect the cultural, social, economic and commercial life of each of the towns and villages in which the festival took place.  It was a marvellous initiative.  I have a feeling that it might have been inspired by the Festival of Britain which had taken place two years earlier.  Either way, when one thinks about marketing, merchandising and all of the modern tools that are used, it was a great tribute to the leaders of both the Government and, as it then was, Bord F\u00e1ilte that they were able to introduce modern methods of selling Ireland.  They had a slogan, postage stamps and merchandise, all of which we now take for granted.  When one considers this was 1953, it was quite extraordinary.  It was very successful and it lifted the morale of the country in the way that I hope this gathering will lift the morale of the country at this difficult time.<\/p><p>I am particularly interested in the Minister's focus on the United Kingdom.  Irrespective of whatever efforts are being made internationally to bring the Irish family back home - as the Minister pointed out, America looms large in that regard and it is a wonderful initiative to advertise during the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; series which is very popular in America - the United Kingdom market in general is key.  The Minister pointed out that he is using flyers and whatever else, but does he have any insight into why there is a drop in the number of visitors from the United Kingdom?  Is it a perception that Ireland is still an expensive country to visit?  Is it because it is as cheap to go for a week to a sunny clime from the United Kingdom as it is to come to Ireland?  Has there been any sort of insight - with the massive amount of time, effort and money, and the Minister's personal participation - by profiling in the United Kingdom over the past number of years?  There seems to be a continuing decline in rather than even a stabilisation of the United Kingdom market, which is our single most important market.  I wonder if the Minister has anything to add to what he has already said in terms of how he will address this because, as he will be aware, it is extremely serious.<\/p><p>I also hope that throughout the year there will be an opportunity to promote Irish culture and Irish cultural activities, in other words, the concept of Ireland at home.  We have such a valuable cultural identity to offer to the world and I hope an emphasis will be placed on that.  I refer to culture in its widest possible diversity, right across the spectrum of Irish life.<\/p><p>I welcome the initiatives.  In my county, I have the honour of chairing the Leitrim Tourism Forum set up by the local authority.  It, in turn, has set up a special Gathering committee which is chaired by the Eurovision winner, Mr. Charlie McGettigan, who is now a native of Drumshanbo, my home town.  They have embarked, like many other counties, on a number of activities that will take place throughout the year.  I am sure it is welcome news to the Minister that such a local response has been enthusiastic and that all agencies and all engaged in tourism, from the local authorities down, are getting involved.<\/p><p>My original focus was on the United Kingdom market.  I am not for one moment anticipating the Minister has ready answers to this, but there is something radically wrong there.  There is some difficulty.  Despite what we are throwing at the United Kingdom market, it does not seem to be generating the response that it should.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100019#S00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1359637800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>There are two Senators, Senators Quinn and Conway, left to speak and only eight minutes for them.

There were not hundreds of people at it, but thousands.  It was heartwarming to see how ordinary people have engaged with the project.  Basically, there was a launch and an expo, where every community put on an exhibition of the events that are taking place within their community for the year of The Gathering.  The organising committee had prepared 500 visitor packs containing biros and other bits and pieces for this event that took place between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Sunday, and they were gone within an hour.<\/p><p>There has been significant buy-in by the community in County Clare, as there has been in the community in general.  For County Clare and along the west coast, The Gathering is more important than it may be in other parts of the country because we are so heavily reliant on tourism.  There is such a requirement for employment in the tourism sector to keep families going - to keep young people in university, college, etc.  When there are the bones of 873,000 people visiting the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience in a year, County Clare has a significant responsibility to ensure that it is professional about how it goes about its business in the year of The Gathering.<\/p><p>Clare has appointed a number of high-profile ambassadors for The Gathering, such as Ms Aoibhinn Garrihy, the actress on &quot;Fair City&quot; who is from Doolin, Mr. Marcus Horan, the rugby player, and Mr. Martin Hayes, the internationally acclaimed violinist, and others are coming on board.<\/p> <p>Most organisations and communities are running events.  I would like to see more buy-in from golf clubs because they have thousands of international members.  I am in discussions with my local golf club in Lahinch to see what it can do to create a free week for its international members, perhaps in the latter part of the year.  As leaders in our communities we all have a responsibility to motivate and encourage people to organise events.  There may be old festivals which no longer exist.  Why not reactivate them for the year of The Gathering?  What is great about The Gathering is that it will be successful, and depending on how successful it is I would like to see it repeated in four years time.  The Homecoming in Scotland is repeated every four years.  The Gathering is very much based on this experience so there is no reason if it is successful, as we suspect it will be, that at the end of 2013 we cannot start planning for 2017.  I will finish on this hopeful thought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100019#S00400","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359638400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the House and the concept of The Gathering is very welcome.  It is a great initiative and I congratulate the Minister on it.  I grew up in the tourist business.  My father ran Red Island holiday camp and from the age of ten I looked after British tourists.  Senator Mooney spoke about the difficulty in attracting British tourists but we had 500 guests a week coming from England.  If there is one message to get across it is my father's message from then, which is to give customers such a good time that they come back again.  We call it the boomerang principle.  If one does nothing else one should excel and explain to the tourist business in Ireland the boomerang principle, which is that everything we do is to make visitors welcome so they return.  It is possible to do this in many ways.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I received a letter from a couple who got married in the 1960s.  They bought an old castle in Knocklyon and have spent their entire lives there.  They are not wealthy but she was an architect.  The lady who wrote the letter stated she contacted me out of concern that the State does not appear to be giving consideration to excluding historic properties from its register of houses liable to the new property tax.  The couple believes the preservation of our built heritage should remain a national aim and be encouraged by assisting its custodians where possible, in this case by ameliorating the effect of the property tax.  I mention it because I heard Senator Norris also refer to this.  It is a question of heritage homes and certainly heritage will bring tourists back to us.<\/p><p>Can we think of new ideas to attract new customers to the airports and at the same time bring tourists to some of the less well-known areas of the country?  The Japanese have come up with a radical idea.  On the southerly island of Kyushu a group of businessmen, bureaucrats and academics have proposed establishing free flights for people from South Korea, Taiwan and China subsidised by the government.  The project proposes launching 35 flights a week between eight airports in Kyushu in ten small jets being developed by Mitsubishi.  To qualify, and this is the interesting point, passengers must buy vouchers worth \u20ac1,000 to shop, eat, sleep or obtain medical treatment in the area.  Perhaps it can be viewed as the aviation industry giving away the razor and selling the blades.  The idea is to draw visitors to the hinterland directly and not via the main city of Tokyo.  If the idea were extended nationwide it would give a purpose to some of the rural airports built there in the past decade.  Similar to Irish regional airports, almost all of the large airports operate in the red but several welcomed an extremely low number of passengers.  Perhaps concepts such as this could be used here.<\/p><p>The Chinese have been mentioned previously.  China is a huge market.  I ask the Minister to examine what Harrods in Britain and airports in Europe have done, which is to develop Mandarin speakers.  I believe Harrods now has 50 Mandarin speakers and it is claimed they have paid for themselves over and over again.  A large number of department stores throughout Europe, particularly in tourist areas, do the same.  The Chinese market is already huge but it is capable of being much larger.  The Minister is certainly going in the right direction.  It is great to see somebody with such enthusiasm and the drive to get something done.  The Gathering will be a great success and I wish the Minister well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100020#T00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1359638400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions which were very interesting, stimulating and thought provoking.

Everyone is very aware of what Ireland does with regard to overseas aid in Tanzania, Malawi and other countries throughout the world.  People do not know how much the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does through the Irish abroad unit.

I disagree with her in that I do not have any problem with companies being involved in The Gathering.  They are very welcome and I have no problem with companies making profits as it is what they are supposed to do, but I would not like to see them abusing the brand.  At present if one goes to the website and one wants to download or use the promotional material one must register and complete a form and go through a process detailing who one is and the nature of the event.  People are free to use The Gathering logo for events, tourism promotion and posters but they are not allowed to use it for commercial gain unless they have permission from The Gathering team to do so.  We probably need to keep an eye on this.<\/p><p>To respond to Senator O'Keeffe, I am delighted to hear the fleadh will go to Sligo and I compliment her on the work she has done, particularly with regard to WB Yeats.  The question on what I see as the legacy in 2014 and beyond is a good one.  I hope events such as that on New Year's Eve will grow into big annual events.  People will build connections.  We need to get across the idea that tourism must be more bottom up.  People often ask me why F\u00e1ilte Ireland does not send more tourists to their town, as if a Government agency can collect people from around the world and bring them to a town.  It must be more bottom up.  It is often suggested that we establish more agencies and have regional and local tourist organisations.  We do not need more chairs, vice chairs and secretaries; we need people organising events in their areas to encourage tourists to come or building up attractions.  This is what works and The Gathering will have a good legacy in this regard.  The model of community engagement will continue.  We will retain and reuse the databases, websites and all other data.  I hope the favourable coverage will encourage people to visit again and apply the boomerang principle.  If people have a good time in Ireland, I hope they will return.<\/p><p>The Gathering presents an opportunity to rebuild connections with the diaspora.  It can help us start a debate on voting rights, which was mentioned by a Senator.  I very much support allowing any Irish citizen vote for the President because the President should be the President of the Irish nation and not only the Irish State.  I have a slightly different view on Parliament because parliaments make laws and impose taxes and those voting for a parliament should be those who must obey these laws and pay these taxes and therefore should be resident.<\/p> <p>Perhaps we could do something for people who have left for only two or three years.  It is common that people leave for a few years for career reasons and it would be nice if they could continue to vote.<\/p><p>As always Senator Barrett asked pertinent questions and made good points.  I agree with his suggestion that the tourism industry should contribute to their sector.  The tourism industry is one of the few industries that does not pay for its marketing.  The industry carries out marketing but relies a lot on Government for marketing too.  If one is in the retail or another sector there would be no question of asking the Government to spend \u20ac100 million on marketing because those sectors contribute and do their own marketing.  I shall give some examples.  The hoteliers in Westport put money into a fund to promote the town and the  measure works well.  Killarney has done something similar for a long time.  It is not done in Dublin and Cork but it probably should be.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100020#T00500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359639000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>It has also been done in Bundoran for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100021#U00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1359639000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>New York city has a bed levy and taxis pay a small levy.

Improvements take time because people must come to Ireland, return home to Britain and then tell people that they were on holidays here and found it not to be expensive.  It takes a long time to recover once a country has priced itself out of the market and got a reputation for being too expensive.  An improvement is only happening now.  <\/p><p>I often try to derange my agency staff and officials by telling them that I am a marketing sceptic and I am.  Marketing has been  interesting over the past while.  We have marketed more to the UK than in the past but the number of visitors from the UK has fallen.  We put less money into marketing for France and Germany but the number of visitors from both countries has increased.  On that basis perhaps I could apply the crude principle that the best way to increase visitor numbers is to reduce marketing.  Of course the issue is not that simple and there are many factors at play.  The major factor that appears to be at play in Britain is the weakness of its economy.  We often do not realise that, even though Britain has much lower unemployment, its standard of living is flat and falling.  Fewer British people travel abroad now than in 2001 or more British people travelled abroad ten years ago and that is a big change.  <\/p><p>Another problem is that Ireland is not considered to be different from Scotland, the west country and places that are a lot easier to reach.  Those places have stolen our lunch in a lot of ways.  Ms Vivienne Jupp has led a group that has carried out a lot of research on the issue and provided a detailed report on how we can recover our market share.  We can achieve it largely by improving value perceptions.  Of course improving value is necessary because one cannot improve perceptions without improving the reality.  We also need to target particular groups such as social energisers, great escapers and so on.  We must  pick particular segments of the British market rather than adopting a broad brush approach which is what we do now.  Research shows that British people often view Ireland as a party destination but when they want somewhere with great walks, or to spend time with their families and see beautiful scenery, they score Scotland, Wales and the west country and Lake district of England much higher than Ireland.  It should not be that way because Ireland is just as good.<\/p><p>Senator Noone made a valid point about the spend per visitor to Australia and I agree with her.  The only thing that might throw her figures slightly is that sometimes the spend includes the airfare.  An airfare to Australia will always be much higher than one from London or Liverpool.  <\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh mentioned that The Gathering should be an all-Ireland project.  I wish it was more of an all-Ireland project but the Northern Ireland authorities decided that it wanted to concentrate on Northern Ireland 2012 and other events.  Individual events and local authorities have become part of The Gathering.  Even though it is not officially an all-Ireland event anything happening in the North can be included on the website and in the initiatives if they want to be.<\/p><p>I am happy to assist Senator Keane with her suggestion of an energy conference.  Both Senators Norris and Quinn raised the issue of the property tax.  It is beyond my remit but their points were well made.  Perhaps there is a case for allowing a reduction in property tax for heritage properties who open to the public for a sufficient period.  The tax code already contains a provision.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke mentioned the alumni networks in the US and I agree with his comment that our universities are not doing enough.  We saw the strength of the Notre Dame University network and how much it gains from it.  A big difference between Ireland and America is that getting into a university is different in America.  Often one can gain entry not because one got a lot of points in the CAO but because one comes from a legacy family.  Obviously being in an alumn is much more important when one can buy access to a university.  I would not like Ireland to adopt the same process and we need to draw a line under it.  <\/p><p>The Senator also mentioned the GAA, which is an amazing organisation.  When I travel abroad I like to meet the GAA organisations on the ground.  They have provided a home for so many Irish people who have emigrated, particularly young people.  Often people who had nothing to do with the GAA in Ireland join the organisation when they go overseas.  I always tell this story, when one travels to the United Arab Emirates there is an embassy in Abu Dhabi and Tourism Ireland has an office in Dubai.  However, there is a GAA club in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al-Khaimah, and Al Ain and every emirate has a GAA club.  The GAA has an amazing network in the region.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney asked about the sentiments for The Gathering so far.  It is early days and I do not have the airport or visitor statistics yet.  I should have some statistics in the next few weeks so I will have a better idea then.  The tourism industry is very positive about the initiative.  The fact that 2,800 gatherings have been scheduled is positive. <\/p><p>Senator Conway suggested that we repeat The Gathering in four years time.  We should but let us see if it works first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100021#U00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1359639000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>It will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100021#U00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1359639000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Senator Quinn mentioned heritage houses and free flights.

I commend the residents of The Burrow and the residents' association there for all the work they have been doing.  The Burrow is a community of approximately 80 people with in the region of 150 homes and 15 businesses.  Coastal erosion, in particular over the past few months, has occurred at an alarming rate - effectively in the area between Pipers restaurant and the end of Healy's Lane.<\/p><p>I am aware officials from the OPW met the residents recently.  Everyone knows there is an issue here but the problem is funding.  There is only 15 m of dunes left between the beach and some of the homes.

With the weather we are having, coastal erosion is taking place at a very worrying rate.<\/p><p>I am looking for the OPW to set aside emergency funding.

I know the area well and appreciate the importance of protecting a very valuable amenity.<\/p><p>Responsibility for addressing the erosion problem at Portrane rests with Fingal County Council and I am aware that the council is treating this matter very seriously.  Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process and it only becomes a problem when it threatens human life, infrastructure and properties.  It differs significantly from coastal flooding as assets are permanently lost.  Dealing with problems of coastal erosion also requires a somewhat different approach to flooding and must be addressed in a sensitive manner.<\/p><p>For some time, Fingal County Council has been working towards tackling the problem of erosion of the dunes at Portrane in conjunction with The Burrow residents' association.  The local community and Fingal County Council are keen to find out what measures can be taken to prevent any damage to private and public property at the southern end of The Burrow while also establishing what erosion and sedimentation processes and patterns are taking place on a wider scale in the overall area.<\/p><p>The management of problems of coastal erosion in any particular area is first and foremost a matter for the relevant local authority which in this instance is Fingal County Council.  The local authority must assess the problem in the first instance and if it considers that specific measures and works are required, it can submit an application to the OPW for funding to implement those measures under the OPW's minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  This scheme is one of the principal means through which the OPW, in conjunction with the local authorities, is tackling the problems of coastal erosion.<\/p><p>Applications for funding under the minor works scheme are assessed by the OPW to ensure that the works proposed are viable and are based on a robust technical analysis and assessment of the problems.  To be eligible for funding the proposals must also be shown to be cost beneficial and have a sound economic justification.  The OPW requires that proposals and funding applications for structural measures to prevent or mitigate erosion should be done in conjunction with an appropriate coastal erosion risk management study which fully investigates, substantiates and demonstrates the merits of the measures being proposed.<\/p><p>In 2007, the county council commissioned a report on how to protect the dunes at Portrane and many of the measures recommended in the report have been implemented.  The development of a coastal monitoring scheme was a key recommendation.  Subsequently, Fingal County Council helped The Burrow residents' association apply for and secure Leader funding for a simple monitoring programme to measure the retreat of the dunes.  The purpose of monitoring the erosion was to provide a basis for going back to the OPW to seek coastal protection funding.<\/p><p>The council outlined clearly to the residents the steps that need to be taken to progress this matter.  Among the steps were to engage with specialist consultants to advise on the most appropriate coastal protection measures for this location and ensure that all the necessary information is available in advance to inform an application to the OPW regarding funding to carry out any coastal protection measures.<\/p><p>The OPW has just received an application from Fingal County Council, in compliance with OPW guidelines, under the minor coastal works scheme for a coastal erosion risk management study for the Portrane-Rush area, including The Burrow.  The OPW will assess its eligibility for funding in accordance with the normal criteria under the minor works scheme and having regard to the availability of funding under the scheme.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the study is to undertake a detailed coastal erosion risk management investigation and to develop an appropriate plan to best manage the risks identified to human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity at this location.  The consultants appointed will identify a minimum of two potential low-cost options for interim erosion control measures at the southern end of the Burrow, with the aim of slowing down the erosion at this location while the other studies are taking place.<\/p><p>As indicated by Fingal County Council the 400 m stretch of dunes at the southern end of the Burrow is where the severest erosion of dunes is occurring so an interim solution to deal with this issue in the short term is to be part of the study.

This matter is very important.  There is huge unfairness with the property tax in general and this unfairness particularly manifests itself in the commuter belt in Dublin, particularly in areas of south County Meath.  The property tax is based on a market value approach which does not take into account the fact that many of these houses have very high mortgages.  While there is much emphasis on Dublin and Cork, last year in County Meath the average property in Dunboyne sold for \u20ac270,000 and the average property in Ratoath sold for \u20ac274,000.  This puts both of these towns in the top 13% of average sale prices last year.  The average house in Ashbourne sold for \u20ac220,000.<\/p><p>If one looks at the census to discover when houses were built one finds that 36% of houses in the Meath East constituency have been built since 2001.  In Ratoath this proportion increases to more than 50%.  A characteristic of houses built in the past ten years is a high mortgage.  These people have high property values on paper but they also have high mortgages.  While the Government is more than willing to take into account the high property value to claim a property tax, it is not taking into account the fact that almost all of these people to whom I refer are highly leveraged on mortgages.  This should be taken into account.  Nothing in the property tax takes into account ability to pay.  Ability to pay is hampered even more for those in the commuter belt of Dublin by the fact they have large mortgages.  The proposed property tax is inequitable and biased against many home owners in County Meath.  I suggest the same applies in Senator O'Brien's area and in Kildare and north Wicklow.<\/p><p>There are also difficulties with valuing properties but we do have the property price register so we can have exact figures.  The Government must look at this again.  Another characteristic of commuter belt areas, particularly in County Meath, is underdeveloped county council services.  People will pay these charges but will not receive the services they deserve because by and large many of these towns do not have town councils.  They do not have their own dedicated staff looking after individual towns.  People will pay the tax at a much higher rate than average but they will not receive the same services.<\/p><p>I am raising on the Adjournment this issue of huge unfairness because we did not have sufficient time on Second or Committee Stages of the Bill and I do not believe we debated Report Stage of this very important legislation.  The Government will find itself surprised at the reaction of people to the property tax, particularly those with very high mortgages.  As far back as 2009 I was quoted publicly in newspapers nationally as being opposed to a property tax for the reasons I have outlined today, which I told my friends and colleagues in government at the time.  I made my position very clear.<\/p><p>I am not looking for the Minister of State to blame the previous Government for this tax.  It is this Government's tax and I ask the Minister of State to make it fairer, particularly for those who bought houses in the past ten years who have very high mortgages and who happen to live in an area with theoretical high property values.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100024#Z00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1359640500,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Thomas Byrne for tabling this Adjournment matter.  The introduction of the local property tax will deliver significant economic and fiscal reform through broadening the revenue base to pay for vital public services in a manner that does not directly impact on employment.  It will be fair and progressive, with the owners of the most valuable properties paying the most property tax.<\/p><p>In February 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government established an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of Dr. Don Thornhill, the Thornhill group, to consider the structures and modalities for a full property tax.  The group's terms of reference were to consider the design of a property tax which is equitable and is informed by previous work and international experience.<\/p><p>The Government accepted the greater part of the 18 core recommendations made by the group on the policy and administration of the tax, including its recommendation that the basis of assessment for the tax should be the market value of residential properties, based on the following considerations.  Previous work of commissions on taxation from 1982 to 1985 and 2009 recommended market value as the basis of assessment.  With regard to international experience, market value is the predominant means of assessment where property taxes exist.  Market value is simple, better understood, transparent and has greater scope for public acceptance, as shown by its wide use.  It is equitable as it comes within the ordinary understanding of what is fair, and while other options such as site value tax arguably are more economically efficient, this is at the cost of simplicity, transparency, equity and public acceptance.  The market value of a residential property is related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it is located, and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood.  There will be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owner in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the property.<\/p><p>The Thornhill group examined the issue of broadly similar residential properties which have different chargeable or market values because of their location, with values usually higher for urban properties.  Having regard to its term of reference to &quot;ensure the maximum degree of fairness between rural and urban areas&quot;, the Thornhill group considered whether a tax assessed on market value would unfairly discriminate against urban dwellers.  Consideration was given to other bases of assessment, including floor area, site value tax, house type, or a combination of possibilities.  These are detailed in the group's report.<\/p> <p>All other options were found to have serious shortcomings.  For example, if house type was used as a basis of assessment in urban areas, large terraced houses in affluent areas would incur lower tax liabilities than smaller detached houses in less valuable areas.  Similarly, a large and valuable apartment with excellent amenities in a high-value urban area would be taxed more lightly than a modest rural detached house.<\/p><p>The site value option can lead to the same rate being applied to two different properties on similar sites.  Its international use is low due to the high level of litigation associated with its usage.  The application of a site value tax to properties such as those mentioned by Senator Byrne, namely, properties in the commuter belt of Dublin and particularly south County Meath, would not alleviate the cost for home owners in those areas.  If anything, a liability based on site value would probably be greater than a liability based on present market value rates.<\/p><p>The Government also sees the introduction of this tax as an opportunity for real political reform at local government level.  The local property tax will provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector, incorporating appropriate elements of local authority responsibility.  This will strongly reinforce local democratic decision making and will encourage greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.<\/p><p>Providing local authorities with significant responsibility for raising local revenue has the potential to increase the level of oversight of local authority operations by the electors and thereby strengthen democracy at local level.  It also facilitates a level of local decision making that can be used to address urban-rural variations in value.  To that end, the local property tax legislation provides that, from 2015 after the next local elections, local authorities can vote to vary upwards or downwards from the national central rate by up to 15% so that they can more closely match the tax-to-expenditure needs and commitments in the local authority area in which it was collected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100024#Z00600","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359641100,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I have not argued that the site value tax would be fairer in the commuter belt.

It is a small fishing village on County Waterford's east coast.  There is no doubt that the harbour needs to be dredged.  The Department has recognised this need.  Many vessels can only land at the harbour and the port at high tide because of the build-up of silt.  This restricts the types of vessel that can land.  Given the fact that Dunmore East is a fishing village and a harbour that needs a turnover of vessels, this situation is a major concern.<\/p><p>When the issue was raised, the Department's reply referred to the potential contamination of the silt and ensuing problems, for example, exposing contaminated mud once the harbour was dredged.  The people in the area wonder how silt in Dunmore East could be any more contaminated than silt in any other harbour in Ireland or elsewhere.  There is nothing peculiar about the harbour that would lend itself to that claim.  People ask about the scientific analysis underpinning the Department's claims about contamination in the fear that it is only being used as an excuse not to provide the necessary funding.<\/p><p>The significant decrease in fish landings at the harbour poses a further issue.  If we could deal with the dredging issue, large vessels could land there and commercial activity at the port would increase.  This makes sense, as I am sure the Minister of State agrees.<\/p><p>The harbour is a designated fishery harbour at EU level.  If foreign trawlers off the east coast of Ireland get into some sort of difficulty, Dunmore East is the designated port.  As such, it is all the more urgent that the Government provides appropriate funding to ensure that vessels can land there.<\/p><p>This matter is not just important for the people of Dunmore East, but also for the east of the county.  Due to many changes in the fishing industry, the fish processing plants, which employed hundreds of people in that village, have closed.  I understand that the harbour's turnover is between \u20ac10 million and \u20ac12 million per year, but people genuinely believe that it could be significantly increased were the harbour dredged, as landing there would become easier for larger vessels.  This would have a positive knock-on in terms of job creation.<\/p><p>If capital or maintenance funding could be made available to ensure that the harbour was properly dredged, the situation would improve.  The harbour's turnover would certainly improve.  I appeal to the Minister of State to make funding available to ensure that the harbour runs to its full potential and commercial activity increases, impacting positively across all of eastern Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100025#AA00500","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359641100,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for tabling this motion on the Adjournment.  The harbour at Dunmore East is one of the six designated fishery harbour centres owned, managed and maintained by the Department.  Funding is made available on an annual basis by the Department to the fishery harbour centres, including Dunmore East, via the fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure capital development programme.<\/p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, is happy to advise that the Department has, over the years, continued to support the development of the Dunmore East fishery harbour centre and has provided significant funding for maintenance, development and upgrading works each year.  Indeed, capital expenditure under the programme for Dunmore East since 2007 has been in the order of \u20ac4 million.  This is in recognition of the valuable contribution the harbour makes, not only to the fishing industry, but also to the local community in terms of the support the harbour infrastructure provides to the development of the tourism industry and the local economy generally.<\/p><p>The Dunmore East fishery harbour centre provides a dedicated and essential service to our fishing fleet.  Both local and visiting fishing vessels, including vessels of significant dimensions, are currently availing of its harbour facilities.  The Minister is happy to report that the investment in the Dunmore East fishery harbour centre in recent years is bearing fruit.  The data provided to him by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority indicate a year-on-year increase in fish landings in recent years.<\/p> <p>The Minister is cognisant of the need to be fully aware of the ongoing needs of the harbour users at Dunmore East fishery harbour centre.  With this in mind officials from the Department regularly host a harbour users forum and meet with local stakeholders and harbour users.  This forum provides a platform for harbour users to air their views and gives the officials an opportunity to hear at first hand the concerns and suggestions of the people using the harbour facilities.  The Minister is glad to be able to advise the Senator that as recently as last July, the Dunmore East tourism group, which plays an active part in the harbour users group, formally complimented the appearance of the harbour and the good work being done there by the Department.<\/p><p>The need for dredging works at the harbour is recognised by the Department.  Reports commissioned indicate that 80% of the harbour sediment contains tributyltin, TBT.  Unfortunately, the cost associated with the disposal of dredge spoil containing TBT is significantly higher than for uncontaminated material.  The most recent estimate for dredging of the harbour and disposal of the dredge spoil material in an appropriate manner is approximately \u20ac5 million.  This represents a significant expenditure in the current economic environment.  The Minister confirms that the engineering division of the Department has engaged consultants to examine and report on a number of alternative options in terms of the structuring of the works and the outlay involved.  He expects to have the report in the coming months and will assess at that stage how best to proceed in relation to the dredging issue.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the Department will continue to provide investment in the Dunmore East fishery harbour centre facilities.  The level of investment will of necessity be tempered by the availability of Exchequer funding.  The Minister is happy to confirm that the programme of projects for inclusion in the Department's Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme 2013 is at an advanced stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100025#AA00600","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359641700,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and acknowledgement of the importance of the harbour and funding required.

Perhaps the Minister would request the Department to pass on the scientific evidence and reports which indicate same.  I acknowledge that there is a report pending which examines alternative ways of disposing of the mud once the river is dredged.  I again appeal to the Minister to ensure that those alternatives are fully explored and that the funding required is made available so that this issue, if real, does not in any way take away from the need to dredge the river.  As acknowledged in the Minister's response, this is of huge significance and importance for the east of the county and every effort must be made to ensure it as easy as possible for as many vessels as possible to land at the harbour and port, which will have a knock-on positive commercial, economic and social value for the people of Dunmore East and the east of the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100026#BB00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359641700,"counter":278,"content":"<p>The reports commissioned by the Minister indicate that 80% of the harbour sediment contains TBT.

When this matter was first brought to my attention I raised with senior garda\u00ed, as issues which in my view are relevant, the level of growth in the region and also the speed of growth of criminality there.<\/p><p>Gorey town has grown from being the smallest town of four in the county to the second largest, with a population of approximately 10,000 people.  Riverchapel is the second fastest growing urban area on the island.  It is important to put this into context.  It has not grown from a small village to a bigger village but from a small town to a substantial sized town, with in the region of 5,500 people.  The second, fifth and sixth largest towns in the county are in the Gorey district.  Of concern to me is the percentage rate of increase in crime in the area.  There was a 29% increase in burglaries between 2011 and 2012.  I am seeking information in regard to how the decision to amalgamate these two districts was arrived at.  <\/p><p>Following this merger, there will be approximately 75,000 people in the catchment area, which is larger than the population of some counties.  The number of citizens per garda in Wexford is 548.  We learned during the past couple of days that this compares with 299 citizens per police officer in Scotland, 225 citizens per officer in Denmark and 243 citizens per officer in Finland.  The average number of citizens per garda in Ireland is 319.  However, the figure for County Wexford is one garda for every 548 people.  I agree that there is no longer a need for 700 police stations and that as a nation, in terms of communications and road infrastructure, we have moved on.  I agree also with much of what the Minister is doing.  However, perhaps he will say in his response how this decision was arrived at.  I assume it moved up the chain of command to the chief superintendent, assistant commissioner and Commissioner and was finally signed off on by the Minister.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to address this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100026#BB00500","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1359641700,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank Senator D'Arcy for raising this important issue.<\/p><p>The Senator will be aware that proposals to alter Garda districts are in the first instance a matter for the Garda Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Acts.  The Garda Annual Policing Plan for 2013, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in December 2012, set out the Commissioner's proposals in relation to changes within a number of Garda divisions.  These changes include proposals to merge 28 Garda districts into 14 expanded districts, including the merger of the Gorey Garda district with the Enniscorthy district within the Wexford division.<\/p><p>The Commissioner's priority in introducing the changes in the 2013 policing plan is to ensure the continued delivery of an effective policing service throughout the country and that Garda resources are deployed to meet the existing and projected policing requirements within all divisions in 2013, including the Wexford division.  The amalgamation of Garda districts into larger districts as outlined in the 2013 policing plan will allow for the more flexible deployment of resources and provide improved economies of scale in terms of administration.<\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner has stated that while the revised structures will further enhance operational capacity, they will also continue to support the Garda community policing philosophy.  The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will continue to be provided to our communities.  The Commissioner makes these decisions in consultation with those working with him.  As Minister, I will not second guess the operational judgment of the Commissioner.  In that context, I was delighted to launch earlier today the Garda community crime prevention programmes booklet and to acknowledge the very valuable work done by all of those involved in Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch schemes throughout the country.  Members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora, including Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.  As Minister, I will continue to do everything I can to support the Garda Commissioner in maintaining the strong Garda connection with the community and to ensure that to the maximum extent possible resources will continue to be made available to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.<\/p> <p> The proposed change within the Wexford division is aimed at freeing up garda\u00ed from behind the desk, so they are out and about in our communities engaging in frontline policing and are preventing, detecting and disrupting crime.  It is about maximising the time that our well-trained and highly-skilled garda\u00ed spend on operational duties.  This requires that available resources are deployed in the most efficient manner to provide for increased Garda visibility and improved Garda mobility.<\/p><p>In the context of the reconfiguration of Garda districts and the consolidation of Garda stations nationally, it is important to emphasise that the measures being implementing are not a cost-cutting measure.  As result of these new arrangements, an extra 61,000 Garda patrol hours will be available in 2013.  Despite the cuts in last year's budget it is worth noting that I managed to make available some \u20ac4 million that enabled the purchase of 213 new Garda vehicles in 2012.  I have also secured dedicated funding of \u20ac5 million for the purchase of a significant number of new vehicles in 2013.  I reiterate that this is about ensuring that the budget for the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na of over \u20ac1.4 billion is used effectively and efficiently to provide the best possible policing service for the benefit of the people of the State.<\/p><p>I would like to take the opportunity to express my appreciation for the commitment provided by every member of the force.  I want to express my gratitude to them, on behalf of all of our citizens, for the excellent service that they provide.  I am confident that the changes outlined in the Garda Policing Plan 2013 will enable that level of service to continue.<\/p><p>It is worth saying that we are engaged in a substantial and radical reform of the manner in which the policing services are being delivered  Such reform should have been introduced many years ago by my predecessors.  I thank the Garda Commissioner for his innovation and excellent assessment and work in this regard.  In 2012, a new Garda roster was established which ensures that we have garda\u00ed operating at the times when they are required.  We have the station consolidation process which frees up members of the force to engage in more community policing.  We are now restructuring the Garda fleet, a matter of considerable importance.  It is worth noting that the outgoing Fianna F\u00e1il Government in its National Development Plan 2010 made no provision for funding or capital funding of any nature between 2010 and 2015 for the purchase of new Garda vehicles.  The cuts that it sought to affect across the justice family expenditure area exceeded, on average, \u20ac90 million per year over and above the reduction in resources that my Government has had to deal with.  <\/p><p>This is my first opportunity in this House, but I have done so in the other Chamber, to once again express my deep sadness at the brutal murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe who was laid to rest yesterday.  May he rest in peace.  I would like to use the opportunity to thank Senator Michael D'Arcy for raising these issues today.  I will use the opportunity to yet again appeal to any individual anywhere in the community within the State or in Northern Ireland who can assist the Garda or the PSNI in any way whatsoever in the investigation that is under way, and into those who brutally and callously shot down Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe, to make contact with the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or the PSNI and to provide every piece of information that is possible to ensure that those responsible are fully identified, that they are ultimately arrested and properly brought before our courts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100026#BB00600","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359642300,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I would like to be associated with the Minister's comments.

He made the point that he did not wish to second guess the Commissioner and I understand his wish.  This is not a cost-cutting measure.  My concern is that the decision is somewhat unilateral.  I do not know whether there was a conversation with members of the force up or down or from the rank of the chief superintendent whom I assume passed his or her recommendation up the line.  It is my opinion that the region concerned is too large to leave a station without a senior garda.  There should be one senior garda of inspector or superintendent rank in a station of this size.  Gorey has a population of 10,000 and the district has a population of about 40,000.  I want to see the data and research that has gone into formulating the decision.

He prepared a policing plan in consultation with other senior members of the Garda force.  A substantial assessment was undertaken on how to affect efficiencies in the force and use resources wisely.  It is ultimately for the Commissioner to determine where it is appropriate for particular members of the force to be stationed and the rank of those who should be stationed in particular locations.  A broad range of considerations go into that particular matter.  It is not a simple issue of assessing issues in a population.  It is examining the history of crime in particular areas, where crime hotspots are, where the type of skills required within individual stations are in order to meet the type of criminality, and one that occurs in particular areas, and the nature of the work that is required to be engaged in when it comes to crime prevention.<\/p><p>Very different considerations can impact on the strength of the numbers that might be located within a particular district or division.  It depends on its location and whether it is in rural Ireland or is urban.  If it is in an urban or a rural area then the nature of those areas, the criminal history of those areas and the type of difficulties that have arisen are considered.  The type of issues that might arise in, for example, Border counties can be very different to the type of issues that might arise in Cork and Wexford.  There is a whole range of considerations that I know that the Commissioner applies in consultation with his senior colleagues.  These are issues in respect of which the Commissioner has the legal authority to make these decisions.<\/p><p>With regard to operational issues, it is not appropriate that I, as Minister, or any other Member of the House, second guess the decisions made by the Commissioner who is an individual that is appointed to that position because of his level of expertise.  I do not think it is appropriate or right that any Member of the House questions the intent of the Commissioner or his bona fides in reaching his decisions.  <\/p><p>Of course with policing matters there is no absolute or final position with regard to any policy matters.  Policy, strength, the workings within Garda stations, the operational specialties that exist within the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the particular operations that are put in place to target particular people engaged in different types of criminality, all change over time.  All of this is something that is under constant consideration and constant review. <\/p><p>The Commissioner has stated that the revised policing arrangements that are now in place will result in improved operational capacity while supporting the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na's commitment to community policing.  The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service is delivered within all Garda divisions, including the Wexford division, through the introduction of revised policing structures and the efficient deployment of available resources.  We cannot continue policing in the second decade of the 21st century when we have improved technology, better transport systems, better communication system in the same way as we did in 1922, 1932 or even the 1990s.  <\/p> <p>The world has moved on and it is the job of the Garda Commissioner to take account of needs in particular areas.  I understand the genuine nature of the Senator's concern.  Burglary is an area of concern to everyone.  Crime is substantially down in 12 of the 14 crime categories.  In 2011, before a single district was reorganised or a single Garda station closed, there was a spike in burglaries while crime was down in other categories.  The efficacy of targeted operations has been established by Operation Fiacla, which the Garda Commissioner established in the spring of 2012.  In the period from April to December of 2012, the targeted operation led to 3,500 arrests, with nearly 2,000 individuals charged and brought before the courts.  That has been facilitated by a targeted operation identifying the individuals engaged in burglary and aggravated burglaries.  The operation targeted certain mobile gangs travelling around the country, targeting individuals in particular counties over a period of days and then moving on elsewhere.  This is what new policing is involved in, targeting those engaged in crime and trying to do what is possible in the area of crime prevention and detecting those who commit crime.<\/p><p>Arising out of the community alert and neighbourhood watch event held today, we have over 3,500 groupings engaged across urban and rural Ireland.  We could and should have a great deal more.  There is a need for communities in rural Ireland to engage in community alert schemes.  Assistance is available within the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  Any area without a community alert scheme can benefit from the establishment of one with the assistance of the local community garda or Garda liaison officer.  New systems can be put in place to facilitate people who feel threatened in isolated areas to co-ordinate and co-operate with one another and ensure that, where they have suspicions about individuals in the community, people can be alerted.  The community text alert scheme, which has been set up on a pilot basis, has proved very successful.  Instead of unnecessarily causing alarm in communities and causing people to believe they will be at greater risk because of station closures, I urge Senators, Deputies and colleagues in all parties to assure people it means more members of the Garda force will be available in patrol cars and engaged in community policing rather than sitting in stations.  Members should encourage communities and individuals to volunteer for the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes and to co-ordinate and co-operate with the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  My Department provides funding to assist in these areas.  The schemes can be of substantial benefit to assist the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in reducing crime, particularly burglary.  There are 13,400 members in the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and we cannot have a garda standing outside the gate or door of every person in every part of the country.  No matter how good the policing is and how we reform and restructure the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, we will always have bad people intent on criminality and bad people with no conscience who are prepared to brutalise the young and the elderly for their financial gain.  One of the great methods of assistance and benefit to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is local communities providing information and taking action to prevent crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013100027#CC00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1359642900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 3.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 February 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
