The US legislative and regulatory measures include an embargo on making or receiving payments from Cuba and\/or facilitating the making or receiving of payments from Cuba.<br\/><br\/>Bank of Ireland depends on correspondent banks for the processing of our national, European and international transactions, including our SEPA (Single European Payment Area) transactions. We are reliant on our correspondent banks because they process and facilitate all such transactions on our behalf. The current issue has arisen as a result of the transition to SEPA. As it happens, our principal correspondent bank for SEPA transactions is a leading US bank who must comply with its own regulatory requirements and obligations\u00a0to avoid a possible exposure to regulatory sanctions and penalties.<br\/><br\/>As a result, we are not in\u00a0a position to process such transactions.

The Bank undertook to sell the combined portfolio of the FRNs and the fixed rate bond as soon as possible provided the conditions of financial stability permit.<\/p><p>  The Bank also indicated that, as a minimum, it will make sales in accordance with the following schedule: to end 2014 (&euro;0.5 billion), 2015-2018 (&euro;0.5 billion per annum), 2019-2023 (&euro;1 billion per annum), and 2024 on (&euro;2 billion per annum until all bonds are sold).  The current schedule would see all of the bonds held by the CBI sold by c.2034.  The Bank's recent Annual Report notes that sales have been made from this combined portfolio, with the Bank selling &euro;350mn of its holdings of the Government 2025 Fixed Rate Bond in 2013.  The Central Bank does not provide updates on bond sales outside of their annual report.<\/p><p>  Under the original Promissory Note arrangement, the Government was scheduled to make annual payments of &euro;3.1 billion thereby putting significant upward pressure on the amounts to be funded from the market. Following a long period of negotiation the notes were replaced in February 2013 with a portfolio of Irish Government bonds (as outlined above).  The provision of these long-term non-amortising Government bonds to replace the amortising Promissory Notes has therefore had significant benefits from a market perspective as it ensures that there will be much less issuance of Irish Government bonds into the market over the next decade and beyond than would otherwise have been the case.<\/p><p>  The market continues to react positively to the restructuring and we have recently seen further reduction of the 10 year bond yields to 1.65%, far lower than had been the case before the State entered the EU\/IMF programme and thus enabling the State to substantially reduce\u00a0its cost of borrowings.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank\u00a0is independent in respect of\u00a0its decisions to sell the bonds held by them\u00a0as a consequence of the promissory note exchange, however, as\u00a0outlined above, the current schedule would see all of the bonds held by the CBI sold by c.2034.<\/p><p>  In summary, the timing of the sales and the management of its investment holdings are matters for the Central Bank and it is independent in the exercise of its functions and\u00a0therefore, neither I nor the Department of Finance have any role in the matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC00900"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[38334\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a list of the commissions of investigation, inquiries and similar investigations established under his Department during the past 12 months or being considered for establishment during the next 12 months, and in each case the person or persons conducting the inquiry and the timeframe, including start and end date envisaged.","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>I would like to advise the Deputy that no commissions of investigation, inquiries and similar investigations have been established under my Department during the past 12 months.\u00a0At this time my Department is not considering the establishment of any commissions of investigation, inquiries and similar investigations during the next 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC01200"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[38364\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 177 of 23 September 2014, if he will reconsider the position of taxing e-books at the standard 23% rate as of January 2015 (details supplied).","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>As you will be aware, the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In this regard, EU VAT law specifically provides that all digitised publications, including e-books, are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT, which in Ireland is 23%. <\/p><p>  The VAT charged on electronically supplied services was always the standard VAT rate, and is not related to the changes being made on 1 January 2015. The 2015 changes relate to the country in which tax is to be charged, and not the rate of VAT that is to be charged.  From 1 January 2015, electronically supplied services, including e-books, will be liable to VAT in the country of the consumer and not the country of the supplier, as is currently the case.  This means that an e-book purchased by a person in Ireland will be charged at the Irish standard VAT rate, and not the standard VAT rate of the Member State of the supplier.  This is known as the destination principle, and it is designed to remove the competitive advantage gained by Member States charging lower rates of VAT; as under the destination principle a customer in Ireland purchasing an e-book from any EU Member State will be charged Irish VAT on that service.<\/p><p>  As stated previously, while Ireland applies a zero VAT rate to printed books including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music, by virtue of a derogation under the VAT Directive for such exceptional treatment, there is no option under EU VAT Law to either exempt e-books from VAT or to apply the zero VAT rate or a reduced VAT rate to such products.\u00a0 The different VAT treatment of printed books and e-books reflects the nature of these products, the latter being a richer product often providing content beyond simple text to include embedded digital music, software, film and internet links. <\/p><p>  In 2012, France and Luxembourg unilaterally made the decision to defy the well-established and recognised EU VAT position in relation to the VAT rate charged on electronic supplies of e-books, by applying a reduced VAT rate to these services.  The EU Commission took both Member States to the European Court of Justice in 2013 because of this breach of law. A judgement in the case has not yet been made.\u00a0 This is separate from the K Oy European Court of Justice Case C-219\/13 which dealt specifically with the VAT treatment of printed and audio books, but did not deal with e-books. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":127,"content":"<p>Question No. 58 answered with Question No. 48.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Regulations","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[38370\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800069#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he will take to defend Ireland from the imposition of fines and other sanctions for failing to implement EU Council Regulation (EC) 2271\/96.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>EU Council Regulation (EC) 2271\/96 provides protection against and counteracts extra-territorial effects of certain US laws and regulations specified in the Annex to the Regulation.\u00a0 In the main, the Regulation takes direct effect across the EU through the activities of the Commission, while the Regulation may also entitle EU persons and entities to take action to recover damages and costs where they have been negatively impacted by the application of laws whose effects are intended to be neutralised by the Regulation.<\/p><p>  Currently I have no indication that fines or sanctions are contemplated in relation to the Regulation.<\/p><p>  Member States have taken varying approaches to implementing this regulation and these different approaches are currently under examination.

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years, and reports now indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol stretching.  This involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the exchequer and the motorist.<\/p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (IA) of the Finance Act 1999.  It carries a penalty on summary conviction of a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  Where conviction occurs on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;126,970, or a term\u00a0 of imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed.<\/p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and that they have been in contact with the motor and oil trades.  I understand also that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations that it has been claimed may have been sources of adulterated fuel, and that they will undertake any further enquiries that are required as a result of reports or information that they receive.  These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that petrol stretching has occurred, and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.  The analysis of petrol samples is time consuming and results for the samples recently taken is awaited.<\/p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that, with this cooperation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully.

These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.\u00a0 Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary, and<\/p><p>  - An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<\/p><p>  In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed an Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a more effective fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>  To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax.  This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.<\/p><p>  Revenue works very closely with fuel sector representative bodies in tackling the problem and these bodies have been very supportive of the measures introduced to combat fuel laundering.\u00a0 Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.\u00a0 This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel.\u00a0<\/p><p>  I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners work in close cooperation with other enforcement authorities, in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, in combating this all-island problem.  The Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, which includes representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other relevant organisations, was established to facilitate this cooperation, and has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime gangs, many of whom have links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, that are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud.  All enforcement authorities engaged in combatting fuel fraud are committed to working closely together on an ongoing basis in this important work.\u00a0Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.\u00a0 Since the beginning of 2011, over 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.  In addition, over 130 filling stations have been closed in that period. In the past 18 months Revenue has secured 6 convictions for mineral oil offences and a further 16 prosecution cases are underway.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The evidence available to Revenue, in terms of feedback from the legitimate trade and increased consumption of road diesel, indicates that the strategy has been effective. The legitimate trade indicates that the incidence of laundered diesel on the market has dropped significantly and that they have experienced an increase in road diesel sales.\u00a0 This is supported by tax data which shows road diesel consumption has increased significantly over the past couple of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800070#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise Duties","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800070#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[38514\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800070#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the negative impact that consistent excise duty has on all alcohol products and the resultant closure of pubs and job losses; in view of budget 2015 if he will take cognisance of the fact that in the drinks industry there are 92,000 jobs, &euro;2 billion in wages, 8,298 hotels and pubs and 44 distilleries and brewers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>The correspondence attached to the Deputy's question makes a number of points in relation to excise duty increases in Budgets 2013 and 2014.\u00a0 The correspondence also refers to the incentive for cross-border shopping and the risks to tourism resulting from increases in excise on alcohol.<\/p><p>  The increases to excise duty on alcohol in Budgets 2013 and 2014 must be seen firstly in the context of the Government's need to raise revenue to provide services.\u00a0 Secondly, these increases should not be viewed in isolation but together with the history of excise rates on alcohol in Ireland.\u00a0 To this end I would remind the Deputy that excise duties on alcohol were reduced significantly in Budget 2010 and also that the rate of duty on spirits and beer remained largely unchanged between\u00a02002 and 2009.\u00a0 It should also be noted that the excise, as a proportion of the pint, is lower now in 2014 than it was 10 years ago.<\/p><p>  In relation to the points raised about tourism, I would point out that in July 2011 I introduced a 9% reduced VAT rate for tourism related services as part of the Government Jobs Initiative.

It lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.  There are steps that can be taken in cases of disputes including arbitration and legal proceedings.<\/p><p>  For business to business transactions, where no contract exists, the payment period is set at 30 days.

Details of the number of site visits during this period are set out in the attached tabular statement (B).<br\/><br\/>There are many complex factors influencing decision location making, such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus populations, significant challenges from lower cost locations in Eastern Europe and the Far East and attractive regional aid. While IDA Ireland does attempt to influence the choice of location the final decision as to where to visit and ultimately where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor. <br\/><br\/>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.

Specifically, under Section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, it is an offence to possess any knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed in any public place, without having good reason or lawful authority.  <\/p><p>  I can advise that a comprehensive and robust legal framework is now in place in this area including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.  The Garda Commissioner, in 2008, made recommendations in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was enacted, further strengthening the law and responding to Garda concerns about knife crime.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords were generally banned from importation and sale. <\/p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to a wide range of crime and policing concerns, including knife and other violent crime. At an operational level,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources. In this regard, areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols. In addition, Detective Units and Divisional Crime Task Forces may be utilised to provide a high visibility presence in areas such as late night bars, clubs etc, particularly when people are exiting, to deter and detect anti-social behaviour and possible altercations. However, it should be noted that many knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement. <\/p><p>  In relation to the investigation of specific knife-related crimes, I am assured that all appropriate resources, including any necessary technical and forensic facilities are employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure detections and identify perpetrators of these crimes.   <\/p><p>In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are involved in a number of awareness measures relating to knife crime, and I understand that the Garda Schools Programme is utilised to include talks on knives and other weapons for secondary school pupils, emphasising the dangers involved and the need for care, vigilance and social responsibility.<\/p><p>  There are at present no plans to hold a knife amnesty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800072#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Policing Plans","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800072#WRF05800"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[38437\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800072#WRF05900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to roll out the new Garda community policing initiative particularly in the Garda R and J districts.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":253,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.<\/p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 20141 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.<\/p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013\/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter. Any potential implications for nurse staffing levels arising from the increase in registration fees will be kept under review by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800073#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800073#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[38343\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800073#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an increase of hours for home care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800073#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800073#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[38355\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800073#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for refusal of a medical card in the case of persons (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

This has resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <br\/><br\/>A major new deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<br\/><br\/>The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in nine EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK)and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.<br\/><br\/>The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs. <br\/><br\/>The IPHA agreement provides for a mid-term review in 2014. As the outcome of this review is dependent on negotiations with IPHA further comment at this stage would not be appropriate.<br\/><br\/>A  new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry, in 2012.  Under this Agreement the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine, this was further reduced to 40% from 1 May 2014.  This has resulted in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.<br\/><br\/>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act.The Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. This is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<br\/><br\/>In the case of drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland. However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  It would nonetheless be disappointing if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients. <br\/><br\/>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. <br\/><br\/>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies. In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800074#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Administration","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800074#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[38434\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800074#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the fair deal scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme provides financial support towards the cost of long term residential care services in nursing homes.

This Code of Practice has been in place since that time and the PSI has operated it in so far as practicable, in accordance with its terms.<\/p><p>  Section 30(2) of the Act provides for the PSI Council to make rules (with the consent of the Minister) defining temporary absence and also what may or may not be done by a pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist.<\/p><p>  The PSI is aware of the concerns raised by pharmaceutical assistants regarding the current employment environment and continues to engage with pharmaceutical assistants and the Pharmaceutical Assistants Association. This engagement will inform the development of policy and an applicable legislative framework that may be established under section 30(2) of the Act. This process is ongoing, and the PSI is committed to expediting this work as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800075#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800075#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[38498\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800075#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the health and Health Service Executive support services available for the residents of an area (details supplied) in Dublin 9; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>The HSE support services available in any area can be identified on the HSE website .

The agenda for meetings are agreed with employer representatives and span the full range of education and training provision from school level through further education and onto higher education participation and research.<\/p><p>  At school level, there are a range of subjects which foster workplace skills.  As the new Junior Cycle is being introduced to schools, key skills are being built into every subject.  These include skills such as communicating, working with other and managing information and thinking.  Over the course of the three year Junior Cycle, every student should have an opportunity to &quot;take initiative, be innovative and develop Entrepreneurial skills&quot;.<\/p><p>  In Transition Year as well as the opportunity for work placement, students can take part in enterprise units and in student enterprise competitions such as the Student Enterprise award and the mini company &quot;Get up and Go&quot; competition.  The latter  is specifically for transition year students with an emphasis on team work.  The mini-company involves students in research, planning, establishing a business, perhaps experiencing some risks and some failures &ndash; before you get it right, marketing, making or providing a service\/product, drafting accounts, writing a report and finally winding down the company.<\/p><p>  In Senior Cycle students taking the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills.  These programmes place a strong focus on active learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork.  Students also engage in work experience.<\/p><p>  My Department has a number of strategies and initiatives in place to ensure that further education and training meets the skills requirements of the workplace. SOLAS with the assistance of relevant experts such as the ESRI,  employers and local and national organisations have  published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system. The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development. In addition to the 5 year Strategy, SOLAS has published a first ever  integrated Further Education and Training Services Plan for 2014 and it will provide information on the range of further education and training funded by the Irish Government and it will set out in detail how the State's investment in 2014 will be used by SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards to meet the skills needs of learners and employers.<\/p><p>  Following on from the Apprenticeship Review an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published in June 2014.   As part of this plan a new Apprenticeship Council is in the process of being established. The Council will be enterprise led and have representatives from business, trade unions, further and higher education bodies. The first job of work of the new Apprenticeship Council will be a call for proposals from industry for new apprenticeships. Along side this work, the curricula for current apprenticeships will continue to be reviewed under existing structures.<\/p><p>  In the Higher Education Sector, engagement with enterprise is one of the core pillars of the National Strategy for Higher Education and provides a detailed framework and range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to respond to enterprise needs.  This includes structured employer surveys and interaction, alignment of funding to national priorities, including skills needs, increased work placement opportunities, staff mobility into enterprise ,a focus on the development of generic skills in undergraduate programmes and the establishment of higher education institutional clusters at a regional level to support enterprise development and employment needs. In the Higher Education Sector, to address specific skills needs of enterprise and support jobseekers into employment my Department funds the Springboard and the ICT Conversion Programmes under the ICT Action Plan.<\/p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of An Taoiseach, the Department of Social Protection and the relevant agencies&ndash; has developed an awareness campaign targeted at both the unemployed and employers - which brings together some of the range of enterprise-focused re-skilling initiatives that have been introduced in recent years.

The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, the CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.<br\/><br\/>In advance of the introduction of domestic water charges, the Government made certain decisions on 6 May 2014 relating to the structure of water charges including, inter alia, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the Child Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. <br\/><br\/>As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements. Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request Personal Public Services (PPS) numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water will treat applicants&rsquo; personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In complying with these Acts, Irish Water must ensure that the data is only used for the purpose for which it was collected and must also ensure that any data collected is stored securely. The collection of PPS numbers allows Irish Water to confirm and validate the entitlement to allowances for each customer. This information will not be shared with any organisation other than the Department of Social Protection for the purpose of verification, to ensure that each household receives the allowances it is entitled to, be it the free allowance per household or any additional allowance for children in receipt of Child Benefit at that address. It will also allow Irish Water to provide lower charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings. I understand that Irish Water and the Department of Social Protection are developing arrangements governing the sharing of PPS information. Any such arrangements will be subject to data protection requirements.<br\/><br\/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER. Over the last number of weeks, Irish Water has been sending application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015. The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for. Furthermore, Irish Water has advised my Department that it intends to initiate a further campaign after the 31 October deadline for return of application packs, to allow landlords provide proof that their property is occupied by a tenant and that they are not the occupant. Irish Water is currently working with the Data Protection Commissioner ( DPC ) in relation to the arrangements for how this will be done.<br\/><br\/>Last week the CER made a determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water, which sets out the position if customers do not validate their details. In these circumstances, a default charge which does not include the free allowances will be applied to such customers. The relevant details of the determination are available on the CER website ().<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the DPC and has advised my Department that it has been asked to provide clarity on some aspects of the legal language of its data protection notice as published on its website, . It has confirmed that this notice was, and is, fully compliant with data protection requirements. However, by providing additional clarity, it will reassure customers that data is held securely, used properly and not shared with third parties, except where necessary for the delivery of water services such as contractors repairing leaks. Any advice given to Irish Water from the DPC will be further incorporated into its data protection notice.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has confirmed that all its systems have undergone extensive independent quality assurance testing. In addition, the DPC has worked closely with Irish Water to agree the process for the capture, storage and usage of customer data. Furthermore, Irish Water has also confirmed that no data will be stored outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), and that it will not sell any customer data. There may be limited instances where Irish Water might need to share information with third parties with whom it has service agreements for operational reasons, e.g. ICT support for systems maintenance, and this will be done under full compliance with all Data Protection requirements.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

Irish Water has commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. On the basis of this report, it has been agreed to incorporate 48,000 apartments, identified by the report as being easily metered, into the current metering programme.

It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Under the Gate 3 grid connection programme over 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers, much of which is onshore wind.<br\/><br\/>The Transmission System Operators in Ireland and Northern Ireland, EirGrid and SONI, publish the <i>All Island Generation Capacity Statement <\/i>on an annual basis. The Statement outlines the levels of electricity demand, and generation capacity, expected to be available in both jurisdictions for the coming decade. This includes the expected rate of connections for wind generation, which is set out in detail at Appendix 2 of the report. Information on the connection of new generation is also available on an ongoing basis on the EirGrid and ESB Networks websites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800079#WRN03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800079#WRN04000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Expenditure","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800079#WRN03900"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[38510\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800079#WRN04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding funding (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects such as the N71\u00a0is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p><p>  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p><p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NRA for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you don&rsquo;t receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800079#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800079#WRN04200"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[38306\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100800079#WRN04300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide a detailed update on plans for the redevelopment of Ceannt Station in County Galway including the stage the planning is at; his Department's vision for the station and the timeframe in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":638,"content":"<p>The National Transport Authority (NTA) is managing the Regional Cities Programme on behalf of my Department.
