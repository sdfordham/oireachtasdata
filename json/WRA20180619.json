The ten year strategy is a cross-Government approach co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality and provides a roadmap to ensure that people with a disability who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.<\/p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has been assigned direct responsibility for progress under 20 actions in the CES and shares responsibility for delivery of another 13 actions with other Departments and Agencies.

My Department consults regularly on disability related matters with people with disabilities through a number of fora including the Department&rsquo;s Disability Consultative Committee, the &lsquo;Community and Voluntary pillar&rsquo; (regular information sharing meetings held with representatives from a wide range of community and voluntary organisations\/sectors), and the Disability Stakeholders Group. Members of these groups may raise issues relevant to their sectoral issues at these fora.<\/p>  <p>  Blind Pension is a means-tested payment for blind and visually impaired people between the ages of 18 and 66 who are habitually resident in Ireland.  The payment is made up of a personal rate and extra amounts for a qualified adult and any child dependants.     To qualify for the BPP a person must supply an eye test from an ophthalmic surgeon to verify his\/her visual impairment.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out that BPP is a unique scheme in that it is the only social welfare payment which caters for a specific disability.  The scheme was established under the Blind Pension Persons Act of 1920 and in effect predates not only the modern social protection system but also the foundation of the State.<\/p>  <p>  A review of Disability and Illness Payments by the then Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2003 examined similarities and differences between the schemes and concluded that there should be one single-tested payment for people with disabilities regardless of the nature of the disability.  I understand that at the time following discussions with representative groups, the proposal was not proceeded with.  However, my Department would be open to revisiting this proposal with representative groups as a way of addressing any perceived anomalies.<\/p>  <p>  Any comparison between the two schemes would have to take into account factors which favour the BPP.  For instance, the awarding of BPP may also qualify a person for the blind welfare allowance paid by the HSE.  There is also a difference in the income disregard for non-rehabilitative employment.  For BPP there is an income disregard of &euro;400 per annum or &euro;7.50 per week.  There is no such disregard for DA for non-rehabilitative employment.<\/p>  <p>  Against this, the assessment of capital and spousal income are treated differently in the two schemes.  Under the means test for DA, the first &euro;50,000 of capital is disregarded while for BPP (as is the case with the great majority of welfare schemes) the first &euro;20,000 of capital only is disregarded.  Furthermore, In the case of BPP there are no disregards for spousal, civil partner or cohabitant earnings. <\/p>  <p>  However for other factors, the treatment of conditions is similar.  A person in receipt of BPP or DA can earn &euro;120 per week in rehabilitative earnings before these earnings affect payment.  If a person earns more than &euro;120 per week, 50% of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are not taken into account in the BPP or DA means test.  Earnings over &euro;350 are assessed in full.<\/p>  <p>  I should point out that a person making an application for BPP will generally be encouraged to ascertain first of all whether they would be better off availing of DA rather than BPP and they may then opt for the more beneficial payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900058#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900058#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[26568\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900058#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which progress has been made in addressing the circumstances of women deprived of contributory pensions having retired from the workplace while raising their families or due to the marriage ban and who have made a major contribution to society in the course of their working lives; if their cases can be re-examined with a view to crediting them with sufficient contributions to enable them qualify for a State or retirement pension; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of defined benefit schemes, neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published in February of this year, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed. <\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a sponsoring employer will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions to a scheme can cease.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard. <\/p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900059#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Reform","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900059#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[26562\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900059#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans for reforms to child benefit; her further plans to introduce means testing; her plans to increase it in budget 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>Child Benefit is a monthly payment made to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.

In Budgets 2012 and 2013, the Government first reduced and then abolished the rebate payment.  This decision was made because of the high cost of the rebate and its impact on the financial sustainability of the social insurance fund at the time of the economic crisis.  Furthermore, the rebate to employers was paid regardless of a company&rsquo;s financial situation and ability to pay, thus benefiting viable and profitable companies, including multinational companies.

Employers who declare they cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments, albeit they continue to trade, are required to submit documentation from their accountants or solicitors and to accept liability for the redundancy payment to the social insurance fund.

I understand that the scheme is very much financially secure and its assets adequately cover all liabilities that will arise in the event the Trustees take a decision to wind-up the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Where a scheme is closed to new members or closed to future accrual of benefits, the scheme remains subject, under EU and Irish law, to the funding standard requirements and to the Pensions Act generally and it must continue to satisfy the minimum funding standard into the future.  The sponsoring employer role also continues in relation to that scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit (DB) schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.<\/p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.<\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.<\/p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard.<\/p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the earliest possible opportunity.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900059#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900060#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[26406\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900060#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to address the severe poverty and deprivation being experienced by lone parent households, particularly in the context of budget 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>Research repeatedly shows that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is through employment and the Indecon report on lone parents, published in 2017, echoed this view.  The report found that the changes made to the one-parent family payment scheme in 2012 increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective, as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the Budget measures to date, is likely to have impacted positively on poverty rates since 2016 (the most recent available data) and this improvement is expected to continue over the coming years.

If a seasonal or a part-time worker meets this requirement they may requalify.

Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 11.9% (32,300 persons) in May 2018 estimated by CSO, down from a peak rate of almost 32% in 2012.  The youth unemployment rate now lies significantly below the EU-28 average rate of 16.1%.  The actual number of young people unemployed is estimated to have peaked at 97,800 persons in late 2010.

The fact of the UK&rsquo;s presentation on 7 June of a paper on a temporary customs arrangement, which it sees as relevant to aspects of the island of Ireland backstop, was a welcome, though incomplete, step forward in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  After its publication, Michel Barnier, while also welcoming this step, raised questions and concerns about the proposal.  The absence of proposals on regulatory alignment is clearly a major gap &ndash; though the UK has acknowledged that this aspect needs to be addressed &ndash; as is the suggestion that the arrangement should be time-limited, though it is welcome that the date of end-2021 is aspirational.  The Commission, in its further analysis of the paper, has identified numerous issues related to the proposal&rsquo;s legal and technical viability, and to its compatibility with the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union.  It is the Commission which is the Union&rsquo;s negotiator with the British Government on these issues.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus remains on the outcome we need to see, of which a key element is ensuring the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is welcome that the UK&rsquo;s commitment to this is reaffirmed in its proposal, and that the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK in the joint progress report of December 2017 and repeated by Prime Minister May in her letter to President Tusk in March have been reiterated.<\/p>  <p>  Michel Barnier and his team also provide regular updates to the EU27 Member States on the discussions on the future EU-UK relationship, which are progressing, albeit slowly.  The EU is approaching these discussions in accordance with the March European Council Guidelines, which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s determination to have as close as possible a partnership with the UK in the future.  These Guidelines also emphasised that any future agreement must have the correct balance of rights and obligations and that the integrity of the Single Market must be preserved.  Clearly, it is in Ireland&rsquo;s strong interest to have the closest possible EU-UK relationship, within the parameters set by the UK&rsquo;s own red lines, which we hope may be modified.<\/p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I also engage frequently with our UK counterparts on a wide range of issues of mutual interest. In addition to further strengthening our bilateral ties, such engagement also provides an opportunity to build the UK&rsquo;s understanding of the EU&rsquo;s position on the Irish-specific issues and underline the importance of finalizing the Protocol as an integral and indispensable part of the Withdrawal Agreement <\/p>  <p>  I have spoken with the Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, on a number of occasions in recent weeks.  During these exchanges, I have stressed that, while our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided.  I have underlined that we must have certainty in all scenarios on the commitments made on Ireland and Northern Ireland and that this certainty requires agreement on the Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.  The sooner this can be agreed, the sooner substantial negotiations on the future relationship, which will determine the arrangements for east\/west trade and many other important issues, can begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900062#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[26308\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900062#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has spoken to Mr. Michel Barnier since he met with Mr. David Davis in Brussels on 11 June 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>I most recently met Michel Barnier on 14 May in the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50) in Brussels and on 30 April during his visit to the All-Island Civic Dialogue in Dundalk.<\/p><p>I will meet Mr Barnier again this week when he accompanies Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, on his visit to Dublin.

But it would be a symbolic gesture, and as such, the Government must also consider the likely impact, and the effect of such an action on Ireland&rsquo;s own influence and standing on this and other questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":222,"content":"<p>Question No. 123 answered with Question No. 112.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[26684\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount of calls received by the passport office in Cork and Dublin compared to the amount of calls answered by the passport office in Cork and Dublin in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>The Passport Service has a dedicated Communication Unit to respond to queries from passport applicants.

Following a plebiscite in October 2016, elements of the accord were renegotiated and a revised agreement was approved by the Colombian Congress in November 2016, ending a conflict which had afflicted Colombian society for over half a century.  <\/p>  <p>  Since then, historic strides have been made in the implementation of the peace accords, including the full decommissioning under UN supervision of FARC weapons by July 2017, seven months after the agreement was finalised, and the transformation of the FARC into a political party.  Formal peace negotiations between the Government of Colombia and the guerilla National Liberation Army (ELN) resumed in May of this year and a ceasefire was agreed in the run-up and aftermath of both the first and second rounds of the presidential election which took place this month.  It is my hope that these negotiations, which are taking place in Havana, can yield meaningful results. <\/p>  <p>  However, as we know from our own experience, achieving peace can be complex and challenging and is far from straightforward.  Significant challenges remain in implementation, including in the areas of demining, attention to victims, transitional justice, and rural development, as highlighted earlier this year by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. <\/p>  <p>  Indeed, the implementation of many aspects of the agreement was put on hold as preparations for this month&rsquo;s presidential elections were taking place.  The first round of the presidential election took place on 27 May 2018.  Iv&aacute;n Duque, of Centro Democr&aacute;tico (CD), and Gustavo Petro, of the Colombia Humana movement, came in first and second place respectively. <\/p>  <p>  The second round of the election took place between Duque and Petro on Sunday last, 17 June 2018.  With most of the ballot counted, Iv&aacute;n Duque had secured the highest number of votes with more than 10 million votes, representing 54% of the total.  He will assume office as President of Colombia in mid-August for a four year term. <\/p>  <p>  This is a period of transition in Colombia, and it will be some time before the various actors settle in to their respective roles following the election.  While Mr Duque has pledged to revisit elements of the 2016 peace deal, the official position of the new administration in Colombia in relation to the peace process is not yet known, and I expect that full details will become clearer in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the agreement, which will ensure a more peaceful future for all Colombians, including by establishing good relations with the new administration once in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[26929\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of efforts to address the plight of the Rohingya; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>Since the most recent escalation of violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar, in August 2017, approximately 700,000 members of the Rohingya community have fled across the border to Bangladesh where they now reside in precarious conditions in refugee camps.  Conditions are likely to deteriorate over the coming months as the monsoon season progresses.  The exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages. Efforts by the international community to address this crisis have focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis, promoting a political solution and pressing for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred. Most recently, on 6 June, a Memorandum of Understanding has been agreed between Myanmar and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and UNDP, the UN Development Programme, to establish a framework for cooperation between the parties aimed at creating conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of these refugees from Bangladesh to their places of origin.  The MoU also aims to help create improved and resilient livelihoods for all communities living in Rakhine State.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively engage with our international partners in these efforts through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses.  Ireland will be active on this issue at the upcoming 38th Session of the Human Rights Council. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating and recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position including in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Council Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February last.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, support the mandates of the Fact Finding Mission and Special Rapporteur and provide for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for these acts.  These sanctions are now being put in place. <\/p>  <p>  While these efforts are aimed at achieving a political solution to the crisis, there is also a critical need for a coherent humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh.  To this end, Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1 million allocated for 2018. Our support has focused on food, shelter, water and sanitation.  Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response facility, we have provided 37 tonnes of hygiene, sanitation and shelter kits and deployed experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination on the ground.  In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassy in Thailand who are closely monitoring the situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":234,"content":"<p>Question No. 131 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base Proposals","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[26553\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has discussed the CCCTB with his other EU counterparts recently either directly or at EU Council meetings.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>The European Commission's current proposals for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) were published in October 2016 and first discussed at the November 2016 ECOFIN meeting.

This applies to qualified cohabitants, i.e.  persons who have been in a committed and loving relationship with another person for a minimum period of 5 years (2 years where they are parents of one or more dependent children), whose relationship has ended due to death or separation and neither of whom was married to and living with another person in 4 of the 5 years immediately before the end of the relationship. <\/p>  <p>  In a case of intestacy, or where a deceased qualified cohabitant has failed to provide in a will for the other qualified cohabitant, the surviving qualified cohabitant can apply for a court order under Part 15 of the CPCROC Act 2010. The court, in considering the application, will take into account a number of factors including the financial circumstances of the applicant and the claim of any other relevant parties to benefits from the deceased&rsquo;s estate. If the applicant obtains a court order for the transfer of property, then the property transferring will be exempt from inheritance tax.<\/p>  <p>  Where a cohabitant has specifically provided for a surviving cohabitant in his or her will, the usual inheritance tax provisions apply. While transfers between spouses and civil partners are exempt from inheritance tax, a tax-free threshold (Group Threshold), below which inheritance tax does not arise, applies in the case of other types of relationship between the person who provides the inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary).   <\/p>  <p>  There are three separate Group Thresholds. The Group A threshold (currently &euro;310,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases, including cohabiting couples. <\/p>  <p>  The redress scheme introduced for formerly cohabiting couples under the CPCROC Act 2010 provided protection in law for long-term cohabiting couples and provided safeguards for an economically dependent cohabitant where a relationship ended or on death. The introduction of an exemption from inheritance tax was part of a suite of changes to the Tax Acts consequent on the redress provisions. Thus, a transfer of property under a redress court order is not liable to stamp duty, the transferor of property does not have a capital gains tax liability on the transfer and the recipient of property is not liable to gift tax or inheritance tax. Without these changes, the cohabiting couple would be treated as unconnected individuals and full charges to each of these taxes could arise. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the exemption from gift tax and inheritance tax in these cases was not intended to give cohabiting couples the same tax treatment as married couples or civil partners but simply legislated for the tax consequences of the redress arrangements for cohabitants under the CPCROC Act 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900063#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[26372\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised by introducing a wealth tax at a rate of 1% set at a personal threshold of &euro;1 million of net wealth with no asset exemptions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[26373\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised by introducing a wealth tax at a rate of 1% set at a personal threshold of &euro;1 million of net wealth with no asset exemptions and with a rising rate of 1% at each additional &euro;500,000 wealth threshold (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[26374\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised by introducing a wealth tax at a rate of 1% set at a personal threshold of &euro;1 million of net wealth with asset exemptions for voluntary pensions and farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[26375\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised by introducing a wealth tax at a rate of 1% set at a personal threshold of &euro;1 million of net wealth with asset exemptions for voluntary pensions and farms and with a rising rate of 1% at each additional &euro;500,000 wealth threshold (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 to 143, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it is necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals. As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. <\/p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)). The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. <\/p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios). In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined. <\/p>  <p>  The wealth tax scenarios in the research paper that are closest to the wealth taxes outlined by the Deputy in his questions are the high threshold-large exemptions scenario (which best matches the scenario set out in PQ 26374), and the high threshold-no exemptions scenarios (which best matches the scenario outlined in PQ 26372) in Table 5 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study. <\/p>  <p>  The first of these scenarios (high threshold-large exemption) has a personal threshold of &euro;1.0 million (doubled if married and a &euro;500,000 increase per child), applies a 1% tax rate and excludes farms, the household main residence, business and pension assets. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;53 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study. The research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioural response to the tax is modelled. The estimate of &euro;53 million, therefore, is likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised. <\/p>  <p>  The second scenario (high threshold-no exemption), applies a 1% tax rate but allows for no exclusions. This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;248 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study. Again, the research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioural response to the tax is modelled. The estimate of &euro;248 million, therefore, is also likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that the above scenarios are not identical to those outlined in the Deputy's questions, care should be taken in interpreting the revenue estimates. <\/p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's questions, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose. This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete. It is also noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes. As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are a number of additional scenarios set out in the paper which the Deputy may find informative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Remit","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[26377\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position in relation to people submitting complaints to their financial institution or to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to alleged mis-selling of payment protection insurance policies; the position in relation to the statute of limitations; if people can now make a complaint if they fell outside the scope of the Central Bank investigation into this issue due to the fact they bought the product prior to July 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>As I informed the Deputy on Tuesday 12th June in response to PQ 24855, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 provides for the following time limits in relation to long-term financial services. <\/p><p>&quot;(2) A complaint in relation to -<\/p><p>(a) conduct referred to in section 44(1)(a) that, subject to the requirements specified in subsection (3), relates to a long-term financial service, or shall be made to the Ombudsman within whichever of the following periods is the last to expire:<\/p><p>(i) 6 years from the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint;<\/p><p>(ii) 3 years from the earlier of the date on which the person making the complaint became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the conduct giving rise to the complaint;<\/p><p>(iii) such longer period as the Ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable, in all the circumstances, to so extend the period.<\/p><p>(3) The requirements referred to in subsection (2)(a) are that -<\/p><p>(a) the long-term financial service concerned has not expired or otherwise been terminated more than 6 years before the date of the complaint, and the conduct complained of occurred during or after 2002, or<\/p><p>(b) the Ombudsman has allowed a longer period under subsection (2)(iii).&quot;<\/p><p>In relation to Payment Protection Insurance (PPI), I understand from the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman's Office that this may, in certain circumstances, be considered a long term financial product when there is a life cover or death benefit attaching.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms and conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.<\/p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years and, indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, which was published in January 2017, makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes. <\/p><p>In line with the EU framework, the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s starting position on insurance for taxi drivers was that it was not possible for it to make a recommendation on pricing as this is primarily a commercial matter for insurers. It did however recognise that this sector serves a social as well as an economic purpose, particularly in rural areas where public transport is less readily available.  This position was acknowledged by the inclusion of Recommendation 10 in the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  This recommended that the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles should enter regular discussions with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector. <\/p><p>That Fifth Update Report, published on 11 May 2018 at , outlines the implementation of this recommendation.  In summary, Insurance Ireland met with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC), on 22 May 2017.  The TAC submitted the required report in relation to this meeting on 21 June 2017 to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To date, no further meetings have taken place between the TAC and Insurance Ireland.  However, the TAC has advised my officials that it is keeping itself informed of developments in the area, particularly through the industry representatives on the Committee, and future meetings with Insurance Ireland are a part of the TAC strategy.  Recommendation 10 has been completed in the sense that the TAC has reported to the Minister for Transport.  Notwithstanding this, my view would be that work needs to continue on this general issue.  Therefore, I look forward to further engagements between the TAC and the insurance industry.  <\/p><p>I would add that, notwithstanding the role of the TAC, the issues raised by the taxi sector were in the main similar to those affecting consumers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that the implementation of both the Cost of Insurance Working Group Motor Report and Employer\/Public Liability Report should deliver fairer premiums for consumers, including taxi drivers. In addition, I am of the view that this ongoing work should better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Accounts","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[26494\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900064#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated surplus from National Asset Management Agency, NAMA; when the surplus will accrue to the State; his plans for the surplus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that, as outlined in its recent 2017 Annual Report, NAMA expects to return a surplus to the State in the region of &euro;3.5bn, subject to prevailing market conditions, when it completes its work.

It is expected that NAMA will substantially complete its work by 2020. The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and in April 2018 it redeemed &euro;243m of its subordinated debt.

The carrying value of the portfolio as year-end 2017, net of cumulative impairment, was &euro;3.2 billion.

Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy was passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. <\/p><p>The legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it was applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.  In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.<\/p><p>Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme.

However, the Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and that neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.<\/p>  <p>  However, what was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group was that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.  In this regard, the initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The second phase of the Cost of Insurance Working Group under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, published its report in relation to employer liability and public liability insurance in January 2018.  This Report acknowledges that many of the difficulties being faced by business are also impacting community groups.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s second Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out.  The recommendations and actions are detailed in an action plan contained in the report with agreed timelines for implementation.  All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.   The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:<\/p>  <p>  - Increase Transparency: enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes<\/p>  <p>  - Review the level of damages in personal injury cases: request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries and<\/p>  <p>  - Improve the personal injuries litigation framework: through a number of measures, namely: <\/p>  <p>  - ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy; <\/p>  <p>-     tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and <\/p>  <p>-    ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.<\/p>  <p>  The fifth Quarterly Progress Update on implementation was published on 11 May and is available on the website of the Department of Finance. In respect of the actions from the Report due for completion in Q1 2018, all eight deadlines have been met.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all of the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group are implemented fully in order to drive the reforms listed above.

The report does not provide any definition of a tax haven and appears to assert that Ireland, and many other countries, are tax havens without providing a rationale for that assertion. <\/p><p>In the report, the authors appear to use the terms &quot;low-tax countries&quot; and &quot;tax havens&quot; interchangeably. The inference that Ireland is a tax haven simply because of our longstanding 12.5% corporate tax rate is totally out of line with the long established position that a low corporate tax rate applied to a wide tax base is good economic policy for attracting investment and supporting economic growth. <\/p><p>The central analysis of the paper looks at links between level of profit booked in a country and the level of wages paid in a country.  This creates a totally misleading impression that corporate profits are or should be directly linked to wage levels rather than to the outputs of investment in all income generating activities such as investment in R&amp;amp;D, intangible assets, capital intensive machinery and investment in staff etc.<\/p><p>It is important to be very clear &ndash; corporation tax is paid where value is created not simply where companies have their highest wage bills.  It is therefore misleading to assert that profits are being artificially shifted by focusing on the ratio of profits to wages in each country.  <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime is designed to encourage the location of real, substantive and high-value adding investment in the country.  We do not apologise for having a competitive tax regime because we ensure that our overall regime is fully in line with international standards for fair tax competition as agreed at the EU and the OECD. <\/p><p>It is clear that the only way to ensure that the right tax is paid in the right place is to ensure that all tax authorities have access to all relevant information for assessing whether they are owed any tax.

Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  <\/p><p>Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding that, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries (and caretakers) who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions Order) 2016 (S.I. No. 12 of 2016) commenced the bulk of the Act with effect from 18 January 2016.  That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 474 of 2017) commenced provisions of the Act relating to adoption by civil partners and cohabiting couples with effect from 2 November 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act, which related to adoption, was not commenced and was repealed by section 2(2) of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which came into operation on 19 October 2017, as provided for by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 443 of 2017). The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act which amends section 2 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 has not yet been commenced. Following adoption of the 34th amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits. To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend section 177 to will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender. <\/p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  That Bill will provide for the establishment of an Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority which will, among other things, undertake certain functions under Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced and my Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900068#WRL04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budgets","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900068#WRL04200"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[26551\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900068#WRL04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has spoken to his other EU counterparts regarding the plans the EU Commission has published on increasing expenditure on border controls and migration.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>The Minister is aware of the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals and the proposed expenditure increase for migration and border management to &euro;34.9 billion for 2021-2027, compared to &euro;13 billion in the previous period.<\/p><p>As Ireland is not a member of the Schengen Area, it does not have access to this EU funding for border controls and visa matters.<\/p><p>However, Ireland acknowledges that significant progress has been made in border management and supports the Member States in addressing this common challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900068#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900068#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[26198\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900068#WRL04600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for the Thornton Hall site; the reason for the delay in the finalisation of the report from the working group that was established in January 2015 to examine the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":506,"content":"<p>A Working Group has considered options, including (in conjunction with the OPW) future uses for the Thornton site which is fully serviced and adjacent to the airport.

This is, of course, an issue which has been the subject of particular debate in relation to the insurance sector where so-called &ldquo;claims harvesting&rdquo; companies have been in operation and may be considered to have an undesirable impact on the levels of litigation and costs in that sector. <\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy&rsquo;s specific concerns are about those companies or firms which specialise in managing or harvesting insurance claims, their regulation will be a matter for\u00a0appropriate consideration in the context of insurance regulation under the policy aegis of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  For my part, therefore, I would have no specific plans to bring forward legislation to regulate claims management companies in that context at this time.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, this is an issue which has been considered in the context of the ongoing work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance Michael D'Arcy TD, which is undertaking a review of the factors which are influencing the increased cost of insurance, and brings together all the relevant Departments and Offices involved including my own Department.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As part of that work, the Working Group sought the views of the Law Society on the matter of claims harvesting and those preventative measures contained in the Solicitors Acts which are of relevance.  In the first instance, section 62 of the Solicitors Act 1954 prohibits solicitors from rewarding or agreeing to reward unqualified persons for the introduction of legal business and provides that any such agreement is void.  The Law Society informed the Working Group of its continued proactive approach to breaches of section 62 and has published an updated practice note on claims referrals and section 62 in June 2017 by way of ensuring that the solicitors&rsquo; profession is fully informed.  The Law Society has also directly notified claims referral companies found to be targeting solicitors about the statutory prohibition on solicitors paying referral fees.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002 also generally prohibits unqualified persons from advertising a service of a legal nature that could otherwise be provided by a solicitor for a fee or reward.  This includes advertising in relation to personal injuries claims in the context of claims harvesting websites.  The Law Society has informed the Working Group that 14 claims harvesting websites have been taken down as a result of the Law Society&rsquo;s investigations since 2014.  The Law Society has also instituted High Court proceedings against non-solicitors relating to two leading claims harvesting websites one of which resulted in a High Court order directing its permanent closure.  The Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance,\u00a0which was published in January 2018 and is available on the website of the Department of Finance, refers.<\/p>  <p>  In so far, therefore, as claims management companies are seeking to directly or indirectly engage solicitors in their claims work, the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2015 are being used as a bulwark against &ldquo;claims harvesting&rdquo; and the relevant regulatory and disciplinary provisions under the Acts are being applied rigorously by the Law Society.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, these are matters which I expect will be taken up by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority in the ongoing roll-out of its functions including of the new public complaints framework and of the new Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal which are scheduled to take place early in 2019.  Along with my Department I will, of course, continue to support the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group including, as appropriate, in relation to those specific matters which have been raised by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900071#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900071#WRO02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ticket Touting","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900071#WRO02300"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[26243\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900071#WRO02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the progress made in stopping ticket touts operating here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":645,"content":"<p>I am currently seeking to finalise a legislative proposal on ticket resale and aim to bring that proposal to Government at the earliest possible date.

While I very much regret\u00a0this news,\u00a0I welcome\u00a0Coca Cola's\u00a0stated commitment\u00a0to making every effort to help those employees who will lose their jobs. This includes redundancy packages, as well as financial advice and re-training. Despite this disappointing decision, Coca-Cola has made it clear that it remains fully committed to its other facilities in Ireland. We understand more than half of the jobs that will be lost in Athy will transfer to its facility in Ballina, County Mayo.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will also make every State support available to\u00a0those impacted.\u00a0The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is aware of the situation and we will be working\u00a0collectively, across Government, to help these\u00a0workers transition and find new employment opportunities. The IDA is\u00a0engaging closely with\u00a0senior management at Coca-Cola Ireland and I met\u00a0last week with stakeholders in\u00a0Athy, including local representatives, to discuss the issue. <\/p>  <p>  This meeting was a useful opportunity to hear first-hand the impact that this announcement will have on Athy and the surrounding area as well as specific challenges Athy faces. At the meeting, I reiterated the Government's commitment to work towards bringing regional unemployment to within one percentage point of the national average. I am pleased that the Mid-East, as a region, is currently performing very strongly on that measure with an unemployment figure of 5.2% at the end of 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The Government's role is to ensure that the right conditions are in place to allow enterprise to thrive. I was glad to see that everyone around the table in Athy &ndash; TDs, Councillors, the Local Authority, and local businesses &ndash; are committed to a collaborative approach to drive enterprise in the region. <\/p>  <p>  From the Government's part, and to back the ambition and potential of all regions, I announced in April the opening of the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) which is worth &euro;30 million. <\/p>  <p>  Under the first round of the Regional Fund, the Co. Kildare Community Network Company secured significant funding to develop a Mid-East Regional Innovation 'Think-Space' to be located in Naas which will be a great support to start-ups and businesses emerging in Kildare and the wider Mid-East. Also, IT Carlow was successful in securing funding for the Insurtech Network Centre, which again will be an important asset to the Carlow\/South Kildare area. <\/p>  <p>  I want to see more successful projects from this Region under the second call of REDF. In addition, under Project Ireland 2040, the Government will continue to make this funding available on a rolling basis. <\/p>  <p>  The support of the National Development Plan over coming years will be crucial to delivering on regional development potential, where three quarters of new growth is envisioned for places outside of Dublin by 2040. The Government recently launched four Funds under Project Ireland 2040 which will also help to ensure more balanced regional development and will stimulate renewal and investment in rural and urban areas, the environment and innovation. In particular, the &euro;1 billion Rural Development Fund will support job creation in rural areas, address de-population of rural communities and support improvements in our towns, villages and their hinterlands that enhance the quality of life of communities and enhance their attractiveness for families who want to live and work there.\u00a0 A collaborative mindset along with the Regional Action Plans will be important mechanisms to ensure this funding will be targeted in the right areas.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[26185\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of orthodontic treatment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":685,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[26186\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of orthodontic treatment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":686,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[26189\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900072#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a cataract operation for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 provides for the creation of an offence of FGM and other offences relating to FGM.  The legislation takes a human rights perspective and stipulates that the right to practice one's cultural traditions and beliefs cannot be used to justify FGM. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is working to raise awareness of the health implications of FGM among at risk communities through staff information and support. An FGM resource pack for health professionals and relevant staff in maternity and associated settings has been disseminated.  The HSE provides funding to AkiDwA, a national network of migrant women, to facilitate working with target communities around raising awareness of the illegality of FGM and sharing information about the risks of this practice. In addition, the HSE funds a specialist clinic operated by the Irish Family Planning Association for girls and women who have undergone FGM.  <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of NGOs to discuss how their work on FGM can be supported by Government departments and agencies.

However, as poultry litter that does not contain residual poultry carcases is considered to be an organic fertilizer\/soil improver and is a valuable source of nutrients for farmers, it can be disposed of by spreading on land subject to strict conditions.  The other main disposal routes for this material is in composting and biogas plants or as a fuel for combustion.  <\/p><p>Poultry litter must be transported by a haulier registered with the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine  in accordance with Regulation No. (EC) 1069 of 2009 and must be accompanied by a commercial document that provides details of the place of origin of the material and place of destination of the material.

However, from an industry perspective it is of benefit that suspect cases of botulism are reported to my Department in order that the incidence and extent of outbreaks may be monitored. DAFM veterinary laboratories are available to assist in diagnosis and to rule out other diseases which can present in a similar manner to botulism.  Suspect cases may be reported by the herd owner's private veterinary practitioner to the Regional Veterinary Laboratory or the nearest Regional Veterinary Office (RVO).<\/p><p>Botulism outbreaks in cattle are most commonly, but not exclusively, associated with exposure to contaminated poultry litter &ndash; often coinciding with the recent spreading of poultry litter on land when the management of poultry litter is poor or deficient.  Cattle grazing these contaminated pastures or coming into contact directly or indirectly with poultry litter are at risk of contracting the disease.  <\/p><p>As part of controls on the poultry sector, my Department carries out certain inspections of poultry units to monitor compliance with the requirements of the Animal By-Products (ABP) Regulations as they relate to the proper disposal of dead poultry and the disposal of manure.  Poultry producers are required to ensure that litter does not contain any residual poultry carcases.  Transporters of poultry litter\/manure are required to be registered as ABP transporters with the Department.  Transporters must keep records, including the details of the place of origin of the material they are transporting and the place of destination. <\/p><p>My Department may also undertake follow-up investigations in situations where poultry litter is suspected of being the source of a botulism outbreak to ensure that adequate measures are being taken to prevent outbreaks - on the farm where the poultry litter is being spread, by the poultry litter haulier and on the poultry units that supplied the poultry litter.<\/p><p>The Department has drawn up Codes of Good Practice for poultry farmers, poultry litter hauliers and end-users of poultry litter, providing advice in relation to the management, transport and use of poultry litter in order to minimise the risks of contamination of pasture to cattle on the end user&rsquo;s farm and neighbouring farms.

The event is being organised by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising the key role of communities as enablers and drivers of the low carbon transition in society, this\u00a0event will\u00a0include two panel discussions exploring how to engage society with climate change and how, once engaged with the challenge, citizens can be empowered to act, focusing especially on the role of Government expenditure policy, taxation measures and regulation in underpinning climate action.  These panel discussions will, in turn,\u00a0 further\u00a0inform the development of initiatives under the National Dialogue\u00a0on Climate Action, with\u00a0the first\u00a0Regional Gathering under the National Dialogue scheduled to take place on\u00a023 June in Athlone.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan will lead to a significant step change in funding available for\u00a0climate\u00a0action\u00a0in the next decade.  Reflecting the strong commitment of the Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and\u00a0climate\u00a0resilient society.  In addition, the national development plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.  This means that well over &euro;1 in every &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on\u00a0climate\u00a0mitigation and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the period to 2030. <\/p>  <p>  The key investment priorities in the national development plan that my Department will take\u00a0forward include:<\/p>  <p>  - \u200benergy efficiency upgrades\u00a0of 45,000 homes per annum from 2021 and providing support for a major roll-out of heat pump technologies; <\/p>  <p>  - delivering energy upgrades to BER 'B' level in all public buildings and a minimum of one third of commercial buildings;\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - implementing the new renewable electricity support scheme to deliver an additional 3,000-4,500 MW of renewable energy, with the\u00a0initial focus\u00a0on shovel ready projects which could contribute to meeting our 2020 targets;\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - the roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat and national smart metering programme;\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - transitioning the Moneypoint plant\u00a0away from coal by the middle of the next decade;\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 with additional charging infrastructure to cater for planned growth; and <\/p>  <p>  - a &euro;500 million\u00a0climate\u00a0action\u00a0fund, under\u00a0which I will shortly open applications for funding, to leverage investment by public and private bodies in\u00a0climate\u00a0action\u00a0measures.<\/p>  <p>  Both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan explicitly recognise that the reliance solely on Exchequer expenditure schemes is neither affordable nor adequate to meet the scale of the challenge to be addressed, and\u00a0that climate\u00a0mitigation\u00a0action\u00a0will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change. <\/p>  <p>  In certain cases, taxation policy may have a stronger role to play in changing individual or business behaviour and investment decisions, including harnessing non-Exchequer finance.\u00a0 Carbon tax, in particular, has a critical role in\u00a0climate\u00a0mitigation policy and the\u00a0national mitigation plan\u00a0commits the Department of Finance to completing a review in 2018, with a view to setting a long-term trajectory for the evolution of this tax.  Clear long-term signalling by the Government on the future evolution of the tax is vital, as well as an examination of what other changes to the taxation regime could be considered that would assist with the achievement of\u00a0climate\u00a0targets.  The low emission vehicle task force is bringing forward proposals in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As regards significant regulatory change, the National Development Plan commits the Government to no new non-zero emission cars to be sold in Ireland post-2030, with no NCT certificates to be issued for non-zero emission cars post-2045.  There is also to be a transition to a low emission urban bus\u00a0fleet, including electric buses, with no diesel only buses purchased from 1 July 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing\u00a0climate\u00a0mitigation policy development, the European Union requires that we produce a draft National Energy and\u00a0Climate\u00a0Plan by the end of 2018, with the final plan to be developed by the end of 2019.  This represents a further opportunity to build on the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan to ensure Ireland moves to a pathway of long-term decarbonisation.  Furthermore, as well as the ongoing development of the National Mitigation Plan as a living document, I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years.  The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900081#WRY04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900081#WRY04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1194,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[26385\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900081#WRY04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the amount paid per project to a company (details supplied) since 1 January 2016 to date by year, amount and project name;

Firstly, it is clear that the Bill as it currently stands cannot proceed without amendments.  The EU recently published its proposal to address the top ten single use plastic items that make up approximately 70% of beach litter (cotton bud sticks, cutlery, plates, straws, beverage stirrers, balloon sticks) and these proposals do include a possible ban on some items.  I fully welcomed the EU proposal on plastics, having written to the EU Commissioner in support of this, and I will not delay in introducing the necessary bans on the items provided for in the proposal when the EU legislation is finalised.\u00a0 However, the provision provided in Section 3 of the Waste Reduction Bill goes beyond the EU proposal to include plastic beverage containers which are considered as packaging under the EU Packaging Directive.  Under this Directive,\u00a0I am prohibited from banning such items.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, more information is needed in relation to the introduction of a Deposit and Return scheme.  As such I cannot support a mandatory introduction of a scheme about which we do not have sufficient information to fully understand the impacts, positive or negative.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee report supports these concerns, particularly around costs of implementation, the effectiveness of this in achieving the desirable environmental outcomes and any potential impact on the existing kerbside collection system.  To address this, I have asked my officials to set up a pilot scheme which is in early planning stages.  This will allow us to assess the likely impacts and costs of Deposit and Return in an Irish context. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in line with Oireachtas procedures, once a Bill is examined after\u00a0second stage, the Ceann Comhairle may write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requesting a money message which informs both the Committee and the sponsors of the Bill as to the decision received.  The Ceann Comhairle has determined that this Bill could place a cost on the exchequer and as such, at this juncture the Bill can only progress in accordance with the procedures of the Oireachtas.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have made it absolutely clear to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, at every opportunity, that I am very happy to help progress this important Bill.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.<\/p><p>There are circa 297 premises in the townland of Castlecomer, Co. Kilkenny.  These premises fall within a BLUE area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map available at www.broadbad.gov.ie and are within the area targeted for delivery of high speed broadband by commercial operators.  Therefore a high speed broadband service (minimum download speed 30 Mbps) for this area will be realised through commercial operators.<\/p><p>It is important to note that telecommunications companies operate in a liberalised market and while I have no statutory authority to intervene in their day to day operations, my Department is collating information in relation to cases\/areas where commercial plans to provide access to high speed broadband to premises do not materialise. In this regard, where a premises situated in a BLUE area is unable to obtain a high speed broadband service I would encourage citizens to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie with details - quoting their address, eircode and fixed line telephone number (if available) and details of operators they have contacted with a view to obtaining a broadband service. This information will assist my Department in identifying the areas of concern and will facilitate engagement with telecommunication operators on this issue.<\/p><p>In addition, for those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. <\/p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

It will include a full redesign of the bus network in order to provide a better and more efficient network for passengers; an expanded and modern fleet of vehicles; new road infrastructure to facilitate bus priority and faster journeys for public transport users, and also upgraded facilities for cyclists and pedestrians; improved passenger information and ticketing technology; and transition to a lower emission bus fleet.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, on the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are only in place for less than one third of the corridor.  This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 70% of people travelling into Dublin city each morning do so by sustainable transport.  The bus system is important because each day the majority (57% of all public transport trips) use the bus for this journey.<\/p>  <p>  Bus is therefore the main component of the solution to address our current congestion problem and to meet our future transport needs.  As those numbers grow, and as congestion worsens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the NTA published a discussion document outlining the Core Bus Corridor Project that is part of a wider BusConnects programme for Ireland&rsquo;s cities, starting in Dublin and rolling out to Galway, Cork and Ireland&rsquo;s remaining cities.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA&rsquo;s document focusses on the 230 km of continuous bus priority across 16 core bus routes expected achieve up to 40%-50% savings on current journey times and the 200 km plus of cycle tracks\/lanes and pedestrian facilities that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of Dublin city under this new investment Programme.  These proposals are going to revolutionise traffic in the centre and outskirts of Dublin.  It takes into consideration the current congestion situation and the challenges and opportunities that Dublin will face over the coming decades while setting out some of the key impacts, issues and challenges that relate to the 16 corridors.<\/p>  <p>  In order to achieve this, in some areas on these corridors, roads will need to be widened, traffic lanes will have to be converted to bus lanes, on-street parking will have to be restricted and trees and parts of front gardens will have to be removed.  These are the difficult decisions that have to be made if we are to provide a fit-for-purpose bus system for Dublin city.  Dublin will become increasingly congested and a less attractive place to live and work if we decide not to make these changes now.<\/p>  <p>  The document also sets out mitigations to these challenges including compensation as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Following, last week&rsquo;s launch by the NTA of a discussion document focussed on 16 core bus routes, the NTA will conduct a public consultation on the redesign of Dublin's bus network, including proposals on a major redesign of routes, schedules and fare structures.  This is expected in July.<\/p>  <p>  Later this year, the NTA then plans to hold a public consultation on the emerging proposals for the 16 core bus corridors, expected in September\/October.<\/p>  <p>  This is to ensure that the public are fully informed by NTA about the BusConnects programme as it progresses and have ample opportunity to input at various stages to its development.  It should be stressed that all of the routes and options are indicative only at this stage.  Individual properties will not be identified until detailed designs have been completed and that will feed into the consultation process expected in September\/October.<\/p>  <p>  There is a clear need to expand attractive public transport alternatives to car transport to reduce congestion and emissions and enable the transport sector to cater for the demands associated with longer-term population and employment growth in a sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>  This is why the major flagship investments to be delivered within Project Ireland 2040 and the 10-year National Development Plan horizon such as Bus Connects for Ireland&rsquo;s cities and projects like the Metro Link, DART Expansion, expanded Luas services and cycling and walking infrastructure are needed to ease congestion, lower carbon output and add greatly to the quality and standard of our transport system.<\/p>  <p>  Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred your queries to the NTA for consideration and direct reply.

This is a long term Strategy with the aim of increasing the number, length and regional spread of greenways across the country.  It will set out guidance to project promoters on matters including strategic nature, length, design standards, accommodation works and early consultation with communities and land owners along proposed routes.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the National Strategy for the future development of Greenways would be subject to indepth consultation with relevant stakeholders.  That consultation has now been completed and my officials are currently finalising the Strategy.  I expect to publish the Strategy in the coming month.  This will be followed by call for applications later in 2018 with a view to awarding funding to a number of projects for drawdown between 2019 to 2021.  In this regard, I was pleased to secure additional funding for greenways last year bringing the total available for the period 2018 to 2021 to &euro;55.9m.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Galway to Dublin Greenway it is not possible at this stage to estimate how long it will take for it to be constructed.  The development of the Greenway west of the Shannon was paused in 2015 to allow all stakeholders to reflect on the issues raised locally and to consider how best to progress this project, especially in terms of route selection and landowner consultations.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind I recently requested TII and the Steering Group managing this project to look again at the route options report to see if a route can be identified that works locally and has the support of key landowners.  While the work of TII and the Steering Group is ongoing I am not in a position to comment on either the timeframe or budget required to construct the greenway between Athlone and Galway.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2015 progress has been made on other greenway projects, namely the sections of the Galway to Dublin Greenway in Kildare and Meath, and the opening of the Waterford Greenway.  The high standard of accommodation works provided to adjacent landowners on the Waterford Greenway have demonstrated how measures can be put in place to significantly mitigate potential impacts on operational farm holders.  The Waterford Greenway has also had a very significant economic impact on towns such as Kilmacthomas.  I believe the same impact can be replicated in Roscommon and Galway and development of the Dublin-Greenway remains an objective for the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900084#WRBB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":1341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900084#WRBB04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1340,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900084#WRBB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1341,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[26262\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900084#WRBB04200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to conduct a geophysical survey at a location (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1362","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1342,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, Sean Ross Abbey Mother and Baby Home is one of the institutions currently being investigated by the statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters.

Long-term jobseekers that have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that 52 week period.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;237 million this year on HHB for over 437,000 customers.  <\/p>  <p>  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Therefore anyone aged less than 70 years of age must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department or satisfy a means test in order to qualify for HHB.  <\/p>  <p>  People in receipt of HHB aged under 66 are generally in receipt of payments such as Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance or Carers.  These payment types mean that the recipients are unable to work full time and earn additional income.  This is not the case for people in receipt of widow&rsquo;s contributory payment who are aged less than 66.  These recipients, who are of working age and generally are capable of work, may take up full-time employment, at any level of remuneration, without losing entitlement to their widow&rsquo;s contributory payment.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, widow&rsquo;s pension only becomes a qualifying payment for HHB once the recipient reaches the age of 66 (State pension age) to ensure alignment with secondary benefits that are available to people in receipt of the State pension. <\/p>  <p>  The concession whereby widows aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse\/civil partner received HHB from my Department, may qualify for the package was introduced at a time when State pension age was 65 and this cohort of widows were seen as significantly less likely to be in a position to take up employment than those of a younger age.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the concession to widows aged less than 60 or to allow recipients of widow&rsquo;s pension of any age to qualify for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  It would also be necessary to consider whether they would be a priority group for the extension of such benefits ahead of other groups such as the unemployed or lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900086#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1430,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900086#WRDD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1431,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[26517\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900086#WRDD02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue on an application by a person (details supplied) for carer's allowance in view of the fact that the matter has been ongoing for some time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1432,"content":"<p>My department received an application for carer's allowance (CA) from the person concerned on the 18 January 2018.  <\/p><p>CA is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a person who has such a disability that they require that level of care.<\/p><p>A person can be considered to be providing full-time care and attention where they are engaged in employment, self-employment or on training courses outside the home for a maximum of 15 hours per week, provided that they can show to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that adequate care has been provided for the care recipient in their absence.<\/p><p>As the applicant is a self-employed farmer, the matter was referred to a local social welfare inspector (SWI) on 4 May 2018 to assess the level of care being provided, assess means and confirm that all the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are satisfied. <\/p><p>Enquiries by the SWI are continuing.

It aims to do this by:<\/p><p>- Providing that employees are better informed about their terms of employment, particularly their core terms at an early stage - this includes much greater clarity about the hours they will be expected to work in a normal working day and a normal working week.<\/p><p>- Improved compensation for low-paid employees called in to work but sent home without the expected work.<\/p><p>- Introducing a Banded Hours provision for employees whose contracts of employment do not reflect the reality of the hours they have worked consistently over a 12 month reference period.<\/p><p>- Stronger anti-penalisation provisions for employees where they seek to exercise their rights under the Bill. <\/p><p>I will continue to work with colleagues on all sides of the House to progress this Bill as expeditiously as possible so that we deliver legislation that is fair, balanced and that works in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900086#WRDD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":1442,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900086#WRDD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1443,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[26777\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900086#WRDD03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason a full application form for rent supplement is required in the case of a person (details supplied) when they are currently in payment and had recently contacted the section to update their circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1444,"content":"<p>The purpose of Rent Supplement is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, where they are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>The average processing times for all appeals determined by Appeals Officers from 2013 to 2017 and to the end of May 2018 broken down by all social welfare scheme types are set out in the tables.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that these times are averages only.  Some straightforward appeals may take much less time than the average to be determined, while others can take considerably longer depending, for example, on the type and complexity of the case and whether an oral hearing is required. <\/p><p>In cases where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person without the need for the case to be referred to an Appeals Officer. <\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeal officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;<i>de-novo<\/i>&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  <\/p><p>Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures to the end of May 2018 are 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.6 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>A number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office. <\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. <\/p><p><b>2013 - Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2013 &ndash;

This is to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The time taken to process an appeal reflects all aspects of the appeal process including time spent in the Department preparing the appeal submission.  The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages which is to the benefit of the appellant. <\/p>  <p>  Appeal processing times are kept under constant scrutiny by the Chief Appeals Officer.  The Deputy will be aware that significant effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to reducing the length of the time taken to finalise an appeal.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for May 2018 are 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.6 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p>  <p>  A number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.

The Department may make an urgent needs payment (UNP) to a person who may not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time.  The Government has provided over &euro;36.4 million for ENPs and UNPs in 2018. <\/p><p>There are a number of categories specifically excluded in legislation from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme, including ENPs.  These include people in full-time work and people in full-time education.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   <\/p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the Exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900087#WREE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":1498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900087#WREE03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1499,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[26915\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061900087#WREE03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the current extent of long-term unemployment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1500,"content":"<p>Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.

Of the 5,620 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers to date in 2018, 2,100 (37.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  1,289 (61.4%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. <\/p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person as was the case in some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2017 and some 35% in 2018.  Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at the oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>Decisions concerning entitlement to a social welfare payment or insurability of employment often require a high level of judgment and may involve complex legal questions.  The Courts have found that decision makers are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.<\/p><p>Where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s\/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.<\/p><p>I

The intention was that this investment would be off-balance sheet and in Budget 2015,\u00a0the Government announced that &euro;400m of public investment would be made available, including the proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is, to provide 2,000 homes.  The objective was that this investment could leverage private sector finance from the EIB, ISIF, pension funds, credit unions and other financial institutions.  <\/p>  <p>  A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.  A body called the Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group was established in 2015\u00a0to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved.  However, despite a detailed investigation of options to use the available funding in this way, including a high level of engagement with potential social housing providers and potential financiers of social housing, no new model that would, of itself, be capable of providing and\/or financing social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified that would be capable of utilising the available funding.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided\u00a0to\u00a0modify the original commitment in relation to the &euro;400m funding to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a longer period (20 years), which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme, as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland.  Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated to my Department's Vote in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore and taking account of the work and analysis of the Clearing House Group, it was considered that it would be more constructive to use the existing social housing funding and support mechanisms and, where appropriate, make adjustments to those mechanisms, in order to provide a framework with more realistic prospects of harnessing private investment in an off-balance sheet manner.  <\/p>  <p>  This approach resulted in the design of an alternative delivery mechanism, the Enhanced Long-term Leasing Social Housing Scheme, which was launched on 31 January 2018.  Funding is in place to support the delivery of this new scheme and the principal objective of the scheme is to encourage larger levels of private investment in social housing, while ensuring that the resulting leasing arrangement is off-balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure.  The scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available for leasing existing properties.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the commitment to develop an affordable rental model,\u00a0this is now being progressed\u00a0through an initial pilot project in Dublin, based on a cost rental model, where local authorities can release the value of\u00a0their land, and also access\u00a0funding for enabling\u00a0infrastructure,\u00a0to reduce\u00a0the construction costs of providing such rental units\u00a0and facilitate the delivery of\u00a0the optimal number of\u00a0affordable homes\u00a0to rent for low- to moderate-income\u00a0households,\u00a0as part of mixed-tenure developments.

The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.

Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC.
