We do not know how hard it will be, but it is obviously the Government's job to prepare the country as well as possible.  Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly clear that we are not as prepared as we should be in several areas.  There has been a focus on the Good Friday Agreement which is important to every citizen across the island, but it is an international agreement which will be implemented in full.  What has received far less attention is the threat Brexit poses to sustaining, protecting and creating jobs in Ireland.  Last October's budget failed to prepare the State to prepare for Brexit.  In fact, it largely ignored the challenges we were facing owing to Brexit.  Unless more is done, jobs will be lost needlessly and opportunities needlessly missed.<\/p>  <p>  A recent Government survey shows that 15 of 20 Irish-owned firms believe they will be harmed by Brexit.  While 15 of 20 believe they will be harmed, only three of 20 are doing anything about it.  Why is that?  It is because they do not yet know what threats Brexit poses.  It is because they are not necessarily equipped to deal with the threats it poses through addressing currency fluctuations to hedge against sterling, reconfiguring supply chains, planning for diverging standards and regulations which are likely to emerge and exporting across an external EU border.<\/p>  <p>  There is real concern the Government believes enough is being done on the ground for Irish farmers, SMEs and exporters.  It is not.  As we know, Brexit is happening.  It is not going to happen in a year and a half.  Orders from the United Kingdom are falling.  A new UK survey shows that half of the European firms that export to the United Kingdom are seeking to rewire their supply chains outside and that one third of UK firms that export from or buy in from outside the United Kingdom are rewiring their supply chains to within it.  Irish businesses need support in preparing for Brexit.  If they are to grow beyond Brexit, as they must, we will have to help them to learn how to sell into new markets in which English is not spoken and deal with very different legal systems, working cultures, languages, consumer preferences, regulations and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of Brexit and the threat it poses to sectors such as agriculture, tourism, retail and manufacturing, does the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, believe much more needs to be done, not just to mitigate the risks but also to turn Brexit into an opportunity?  If so, what new actions is the Government willing to take to address the current shortfall in preparations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800003#A00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1495105200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>When the Deputy says what the Government is doing is not clear, I ask him whether it is not clear to JP Morgan which announced this week that it was buying an office block in Dublin in advance of moving hundreds of jobs to the city.<\/p><p>Is it not clear perhaps to the insurance companies that have approached the Central Bank of Ireland indicating strong interest in locating new activities and, more important, jobs in our country?  Is it not clear perhaps to those companies that were on the front page of <i>The New York Times<\/i>earlier this week explicitly naming Dublin among the places to which they are looking to move further business?  I note with interest the Deputy's bare reference to the Good Friday Agreement.  He made it appear inevitable that its political status will be recognised when, of course, his party and his party leader for months were pointing to the necessity of that happening.  Now that the Government has secured this recognition, this is dismissed by him.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge, however, that if the response to the huge Brexit challenge is a response from Dublin, then this is not a national response.  This is the reason that the Government is committed to strengthening our national capital investment and that the Minister for Finance and I are travelling to Luxembourg next week to engage with the European Investment Bank to examine what the options are for strengthening investment beyond the additional &euro;2 billion we have signalled we will invest in our hospitals, schools and transport network to respond to the Brexit challenge.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy made reference to challenges in the agriculture sector, which have been strongly recognised by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the rest of the Government, but, of course, he made no reference to the fact that the Minister, through last year's budget, put in place a fund of &euro;150 million to help the food sector respond to the income volatility we have acknowledged will be exacerbated by Brexit.  The Deputy made reference to tourism but no reference to the fact that the Government retained the lower VAT rate of 9% for the sector and the fact that over the past number of months and, indeed, year, access to the country has increased through airports with new routes to Ireland, all in recognition of the challenge that Brexit will create.<br\/><br\/>The only bit on which I agree with the Deputy is that we are all united in recognising the scale of the Brexit challenge for our country and we all acknowledge we must explore all options open to the Government to respond, but I do not accept the Deputy's contention, which is not borne out by the facts that I have laid out, that the Government's actions to date have not recognised the scale of the challenge.

His response is consistent with that of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is, \"We are doing everything we can\".  That is the concern because I do not believe, and many businesses do not believe, the Government is doing everything it can.  It is great that JP Morgan is looking for offices here but that is of no interest to Irish-owned SMEs worried about whether they will be able to sell their products into the UK.  The 2017 Action Plan for Jobs explicitly lays out how much money the Government has provided to the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia combined for Brexit and it is less than &euro;5 million.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has yet to meet the Irish Aviation Authority or the DAA on the threats posed by Brexit.  Could the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform please address that?  Does he believe that less than &euro;5 million is enough?

He was right, and Fine Gael has delivered chaos in spades.  The reality is that he came to office in a time of crisis, and he leaves office at a time of crisis.  There is a paralysis in the Irish body politic.  It is a paralysis by design, delivered courtesy of the supply and confidence arrangement with Fianna F&aacute;il.  As a result, we have a do-nothing Government.  Deputy Kenny not only triggered a race to replace him as leader of Fine Gael, but more significantly to replace him as Taoiseach.  That contest now creates the appalling vista for those who have suffered most during Fine Gael's six years leading Government.  Lined up to replace Deputy Kenny, we have the great demoniser of the unemployed and poor, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, or the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, or for chronic homelessness and hotel rooms, Deputy Simon Coveney.  That is some choice.  I have no doubt that ordinary people throughout the country are dancing jigs of delight in anticipation of either.<\/p>  <p>  Two things are certain.  First, irrespective of who wins, the prospective new Taoiseach will not be an advocate for progressive politics.  He will not be for housing people, ending the two-tier health service, or building a real republic.  Second and most significantly, he will not have contested a general election as leader of Fine Gael, and therefore will not have a clear mandate from the people to lead the Government.  If the new leader is confident that the policies of Fine Gael command the support of the electorate, then that should be put to the test.  He should seek a mandate from the electorate for the position of An Taoiseach.  He should give the electorate a choice between progressive alternatives or more of the same.

It is an Ireland where workers have had the stick taken to them.  One in five are low paid, there is a gender pay gap of 14% and a two-tier pay is Government policy.  It is an Ireland where a job is no longer a guarantee of a life free from poverty or even of a roof over one's head.  This is the Ireland Deputy Enda Kenny has helped to shape.  Every one of his six budgets were regressive and every one widened the gap between the rich and the rest.  Did the Taoiseach fashion this island on his own?  Of course not.

If the backlash against social inequality grows in the years ahead, if the strikes and magnificent anti-water charges movement come to be seen not as a blip but as the forerunners of even bigger challenges to inequality and injustice, then I strongly suspect the honest historian will say the legacy of this Taoiseach was the social inequality which fed that backlash and which can change the political direction taken by the nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800007#E00900","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1495107000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Let me reassure Deputy Barry the backbenches behind me, my party and colleagues such as the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, beside me, understand the social circumstances and social needs that are out there every bit as vividly as Deputy Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800007#E01000","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1495107000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I doubt it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800007#E01100","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1495107000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry has no monopoly on compassion.

I wish him well on a personal level.  For many in Fine Gael, his has been a very successful tenure.  There will be other opportunities to debate his legacy but I would like to wish him well at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  Last month the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, launched what is essentially a State sponsored, self-promoting public campaign calling on people to report those they suspect of engaging in social welfare fraud.<\/p><p>The claim that over &euro;500 million was saved in 2016 through a range of anti-fraud measures within the Department of Social Protection is central to this public campaign.  The Minister has been found to have embellished and manipulated the social welfare figures.  The actual figure for fraud is closer to &euro;41 million, or 0.2% of the social welfare budget.  It has been revealed that the estimate figures include moneys that would have been saved over 52 weeks in the cases of some payments and over 136 weeks in other cases, rather than what has actually been saved.  It is possible that the inaccuracy of &euro;450 million in the Minister's calculations can be attributed not to a miscalculation but to a calculated tactic as part of his leadership challenge.  The Minister's campaign targets a vulnerable cohort of people including the elderly, lone parents, people with disabilities and the unemployed.<\/p> <p> This level of scrutiny is not replicated when it comes to tackling white-collar crime.  Over the past ten years, Ireland has lost approximately &euro;25 billion through economic crime.  This loss of &euro;2.5 billion a year equates to more than 60 times the annual level of social welfare fraud.  The Exchequer has lost tens of billions of euro through the activities of NAMA in extremely suspicious circumstances involving the current Government.  The sale of NAMA's Northern loanbook led to a recorded loss of &euro;162 million.  NAMA recorded total losses of &euro;800 million in respect of its Northern Ireland loan portfolio between 2010 and 2014.  The Government is refusing to accept that there is anything wrong with this.  When 15,000 people were defrauded by Irish banks on their mortgage interest rates, it caused misery and led to considerable losses for families.  What about the 100 families that have lost their homes as a result of this fraud?  It has been calculated that over the lifetimes of these mortgages, the amount of money involved in this criminal action is at least &euro;500 million.<\/p> <p> The Government has never taken white-collar crime seriously.  The staffing levels of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement have decreased by more than 18% since 2010.  The number of garda&iacute; working in the office has been reduced by 25%.  Furthermore, the 2015 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report noted that \"the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation are struggling to manage the volume of suspicious financial transaction reports forwarded to them as part of money laundering and terrorist financing legislation\".  We do not even collate statistics on white-collar crime.  The figures that are drawn up are combined with welfare fraud statistics in an effort to massage the figures.  If the Government had paid as much attention to white-collar criminals as it is now paying to potential social welfare fraud, it could have saved tens of billions of euro, which is far more than the &euro;41 million that is lost in social welfare fraud each year.  When will the Government begin to address this scandal by targeting the corporate criminals and tax cheats who have escaped its public campaign?  When will it target criminals in suits as vigorously as it is targeting those who depend on social welfare?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800008#F01200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495107900,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his gracious comments in response to the announcement made by the Taoiseach yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  All fraud is wrong and illegal and should be subject to the fullest possible enforcement response from the State.  All of the issues raised by the Deputy with regard to white-collar crime and corporate fraud are dealt with by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement with the support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As we all know, Revenue pursues tax fraud relentlessly and successfully.  Given that the social welfare system involves annual expenditure of almost &euro;20 billion, I suggest that fraud involving forms of income support that are designed to support and protect people on low incomes who are in need at vulnerable points in their lives is particularly worthy of investigation and should be dealt with.  That is what the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is attempting to do.  I would have hoped that when the Deputy was acknowledging the Minister's motives in this regard, he would also have acknowledged that the first set of comprehensive increases in social welfare payments since 2007 or 2010, depending on the payments in question, was provided for in budget 2017.  Those increases were put in place because all members of the Government recognise the need to support our social welfare system and those who rely on social welfare payments.<\/p><p>I would argue with the Deputy that we need to tackle those who have been involved in defrauding the State from a form of payment that is meant to be used to support those who are vulnerable and need additional income.  This must be tackled and more needs to be done on it.<\/p> <p> Regarding the figure the Deputy raised, the Department of Social Protection has outlined that the &euro;506 million figure relates to both control and anti-fraud activity.  All the material relating to that campaign recognises that.  Since this campaign was launched on 1 May of this year, the Department has received more than 1,250 reports of social welfare fraud from members of the public, which represents an increase of more than double the figure for the previous year.  Up to May 2016, the figure was 575, and that figure has now more than doubled.  That is as a result of the campaign the Department of Social Protection put in place.  Its purpose is to stop the abuse of taxpayers' money, which is meant to be used to support those who need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800009#G00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495108200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>It is interesting the Minister in his response said that all fraud is wrong but in his eyes and those of Fine Gael and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, all fraud is not wrong, only social welfare fraud is wrong and that is the only fraud that is being actively pursued.

Will the Minister advise us of the way in which staffing levels in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement have been maintained since 2010 and by how much they have reduced?  How many forensic accountants does that office employ who can investigate fraud issues?  When we have those figures, that will reveal the real attitude of the Government to tackling fraud.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said that the first comprehensive increases were in 2017.  We could have had far better increases before now if the Government had been tackling white collar crime and the proceeds of that crime had been retained in the Exchequer.

the capacity of the Dublin Region as a destination for living, visiting and for locating and doing business is being seriously undermined;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; significant actions are required to increase capacity and usability of public transport, to better manage traffic during peak periods and to reduce the private car share dependence by commuting traffic especially;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the population in the GDA is expected to grow by 22 per cent to 1.8 million by 2030 and by 26 per cent to 700,000 in the Mid-East Region alone including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow and increasing investment in rail services including the Dublin Area Rapid Transport (DART) expansion, as well as vital bus services including Bus Rapid Transit, is absolutely essential;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this Government lacks a comprehensive vision and strategic plan for how to cope with future public transport demand in the core Dublin City Area as well as the GDA;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; previous Governments and the current Government have neglected infrastructural development, particularly in regional areas, but also in the GDA;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; many previous infrastructural framework plans were shelved or cut short due to lack of funding in the past decade, in particular the National Spatial Strategy; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Capital Plan is emblematic of the lack of ambition, vision and forward planning for public transport;acknowledges:&mdash;

the urgent need to increase the numbers and frequency of public buses from expanding suburban areas, in order to tackle capacity issues and relieve traffic congestion for commuters;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

that transport bottlenecks and congestion are increasingly becoming a drag on growth and productivity in our cities as well as hindering wider regional development in large parts of the country;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that despite the historically low cost of financing to deliver economically and socially critical infrastructure projects, this Government has produced no policy plans for how to mitigate transport infrastructure deficits;<br \/><br \/>that now is the time to:<blockquote>&mdash; examine the feasibility of decreasing the timeline for building critical transport infrastructure like the DART Underground and Metro North;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; make vital improvements such as bus lane completions and removing &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; for Dublin buses;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure priority signaling at junctions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; continue to invest in real time passenger information, which will increase capacity and service reliability on public transport, make it easier for commuters to get to work and relieve congestion in our cities; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; begin work with local authorities to identify suitable sites for park and ride facilities at key locations for commuters, strategically located next to public transport connections;<\/blockquote>&mdash; that the Government has completely failed to mobilise additional investment in transport infrastructure available under the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), and of the EFSI transactions within the European Union, 6 per cent are in the transport sector, yet in Ireland there has not been a single transport project put forward by the Government to the European Investment Bank (EIB) under the &euro;500 billion funding stream; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the decision to cancel the DART Underground project, described by the National Transport Authority (NTA) as &lsquo;the missing link&rsquo; in Ireland&rsquo;s rail infrastructure, was short-sighted and a costly set-back for the liveability of the city, while the only large transport infrastructure contained in the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan, &lsquo;the optimised Metro North&rsquo; proposal, could be fundamentally lacking capacity as it was recommended on the basis of reduced employment growth and passenger demand projections in 2013, which are no longer accurate; andcalls on the Government to:&mdash; commit to the retention of existing Dublin Bus routes and cessation of the tendering of routes;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; publish and fund a time-framed plan to make public transport fully accessible to people with disabilities, with a particular emphasis on DART stations, many of which require major upgrades;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; give a firm commitment to significantly increase annual investment in public transport, including funding to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann (CI&Eacute;) companies to improve attractiveness, reliability and integration of public transport and to commit to an increased spend in Budget 2018, and in subsequent Budgets during this D&aacute;il term, to allow for investment in key projects;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; establish a new, dedicated Cycle Way Fund for bike-lanes and cycle-friendly infrastructure, Dublin Bike extensions, the rolling out of secure bike lockers and parking throughout the city as well as funding for pedestrianised &lsquo;open streets&rsquo; initiatives to encourage cycling;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; earmark a portion of the Local Government Fund to annual resurfacing, maintenance and quality improvements in bike-lanes and road verges to enhance safety for cyclists;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

and substitute the following:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;notes:&mdash; the failure of the Government to bring investment levels in Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann back to pre-recession levels;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that this failure has contributed to an ongoing crisis in our public transport system, especially in Bus &Eacute;ireann;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that systemic under investment in public transport provision is contributing to growing traffic chaos and congestion;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that between 2008 and 2015, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael led Governments cut subvention to C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann (CI&Eacute;) by some 41 per cent;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that a number of different finance streams are available to the State to both increase subvention levels to CI&Eacute; companies and initiate major public transport infrastructure projects;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has &euro;100 million in additional funds that could be released immediately to deal with any financial crisis in our public transport networks;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the continued reliance on road construction and the facilitating of private (for profit) transport companies is undermining both the provision of a coherent public transport policy and the existing semi-State bodies entrusted to provide this;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that Dublin and the rest of the country require a radical programme of investment in public transport, in order to make our towns and cities sustainable and liveable and also to meet targets for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and tackle climate change;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the National Transport Authority (NTA) has operated to undermine existing semi-State companies and has facilitated private, for profit, operators by, for example, increasing seat capacity of lucrative inter city routes by over 100 per cent;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the proposals by the NTA to tender out 10 per cent of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus routes to private operators will do nothing to increase public transport provision in Dublin or elsewhere; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the NTA have refused to examine the earnings or conditions of workers in private companies and that their policy is resulting in a &lsquo;race to the bottom&rsquo; for workers in public transport; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; immediately commit to bringing subvention levels in all three CI&Eacute; companies to pre-crash levels by year end, and to a fundamental shift in transport policy that prioritises public transport provision in the years ahead;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; instruct the NTA to cease their plans to tender out routes currently operated by CI&Eacute; companies;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; use the &euro;100 million in additional TII funds to ensure all public transport services continue to operate and that planned cuts to routes in Bus &Eacute;ireann are stopped;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; begin the process of disbanding the NTA and ensure that policies such as tendering of bus routes that rely on neoliberal ideologically driven agendas are abandoned; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure a new deal for public transport and cycling that will change the face of our towns and cities, by establishing a publically accountable and democratically controlled body that can oversee investment in CI&Eacute; and public transport generally.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800022#U00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"vote","time":1495115400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 10;

It will provide for the approval of the articles of agreement of the AIIB and for payments to be made to the bank.<\/p>  <p>  The AIIB is a new multilateral financial institution which came into operation in January 2016.  Its objectives are to foster economic development and regional integration in Asia, primarily through investment in infrastructure.  The bank has 57 founding members, including 14 European Union member states, and is based in Beijing, with China playing a leading role in its establishment.<\/p>  <p>  Following Government approval in December 2015, the Department of Finance commenced formal negotiations with the AIIB secretariat on Ireland&rsquo;s potential membership of the bank.  Ireland made a formal application for membership of the bank in January 2017.  On 23 March 2017, the AIIB approved the applications of 13 new prospective members, including Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s AIIB membership would require ratification of an international agreement represented by the articles of agreement of the AIIB.  Ireland would also have obligations as regards capital contributions.  Article 29.5 of the Constitution provides, among other things, that: &ldquo;the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann\".  Passage of the proposed Bill by the Oireachtas, and its enactment by the President, would confirm such approval.  Similar requirements applied when Ireland joined other international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and, most recently, the Asian Development Bank in 2006.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale for Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the AIIB includes geopolitical and economic considerations, in particular trade relations with China and the wider Asian economy.  Over the past 15 years, Ireland has increased its engagement with Asia, in particular China, the world&rsquo;s second largest economy, in a broad number of areas.  Bilateral trade has grown in significance and, in 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s total trade with China was worth over &euro;11 billion. <\/p>  <p>  There are significant benefits to strong and open ties with China.  Becoming a member of the AIIB would reflect and reinforce the growing relationship between the two countries.  AIIB membership will also complement Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy, which aims to support sustainable development and inclusive economic growth.  The bank&rsquo;s governance standards and performance since its establishment in January 2016 reinforce the perception that it will be an effective driver of development. <\/p>  <p>  It has worked very closely with other international financial institutions, such as the IMF, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to adopt their best practices in regard to governance, organisational practices and project appraisal.  On the other hand, not to join the AIIB would raise questions about Ireland&rsquo;s position on China&rsquo;s increasing integration into the global economy and international financial architecture.  Such a decision could impair Ireland&rsquo;s growing bilateral relationship with China, with potential adverse effects for Irish businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The AIIB was founded to address the significant infrastructure gap in Asia.  Research from the Asian Development Bank estimates that Asia will need to invest $1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure between now and 2030.  This significant demand for investment cannot be met from other channels of finance such as existing international financial institutions, governments or the private sector in these Asian countries.<\/p>  <p>  The bank was declared open for business on 16 January 2016.  It approved its first loans on 24 June 2016.  The authorised capital stock of the bank is $100 billion, with $20 billion in paid-in capital.  The AIIB will follow the model of other multilateral development banks, raising funds on international markets at competitive terms.  Since it came into operation, the bank has approved over $2 billion in loans.<\/p>  <p>  The AIIB currently has 57 founding members which are divided into regional members, that is, Asian countries, and non-regional members, which are mainly European but also include Australia and New Zealand.  Regional countries will hold 75% of the bank&rsquo;s shareholding and thus contribute 75% of the capital of $100 billion, with non-regional countries holding 25% of the bank&rsquo;s shareholding and contributing $25 billion in capital.<\/p>  <p>  China is the largest shareholder in the bank, with 26% of its voting power.  India is the second largest shareholder, with 8% of total voting power, while Germany is currently the largest non-regional shareholder with 6% of total voting power.  Each member country is represented on the board of governors and nominates a governor and an alternative governor.  As is the norm for membership of international financial institutions, it is envisaged that the Minister for Finance would be governor for Ireland at the bank.<\/p><p>The principal office of the bank is located in Beijing, China.  Unlike other international financial institutions, no member state representatives are based in Beijing, although the permanent staff may include people from member states.  <\/p> <p> The board of governors meets formally once a year for the AIIB's annual meeting.  It elects a president for a term of five years and one or more vice presidents are appointed by the board of directors on the recommendation of the president.  The current president is Mr. Jin Liqun, a Chinese national and former vice president of the Asian Development Bank, whose current term will expire in 2021.  The board of governors also elects the 12 members of the board of directors who are responsible for the direction of the general operations of the bank.  Nine directors are elected by regional members, while three others are elected by non-regional members.  Members are arranged in constituencies headed by one of the 12 directors.  On joining, Ireland will be part of the euro area constituency and represented by the director for the euro area.<\/p> <p> To date, the bank has approved 13 projects in eight countries, with a focus spanning from transport to energy to urban development.  Examples of projects the AIIB has financed to date include a $216.5 million dollar loan for a national slum upgrading project in Indonesia, co-financed with the World Bank; a $100 million dollar loan to finance a motorway project in Pakistan, co-financed with the Asian Development Bank and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development; and a $600 million dollar loan to support the trans-Anatolian natural gas pipeline in Azerbaijan, co-financed with a number of development banks.  <\/p> <p> EU member states have used their influence to ensure the standards of other multilateral development banks are mirrored in the AIIB in terms of investments, environmental and social safeguards, institutional governance and organisational matters.  The bank has been very receptive to discussions on standards and safeguards and sought to adopt best practices.  The mandate of the bank and the work undertaken by it to date on governance structures and safeguards covering investment, environmental and social issues demonstrate that it will complement existing international financial institutions.  The majority of AIIB projects have been co-financed with other development banks, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  This demonstrates the standard of project being financed by the AIIB and its intention to co-operate constructively with other international financial institutions.  Both the president of the World Bank Group, Mr. Jim Yong Kim, and the president of the AIIB, Mr. Jin Liqun, have recognised the importance of ensuring a partnership approach, as evidenced by the memorandum of understanding they recently co-signed at the 2017 IMF-World Bank spring meetings to strengthen co-operation and knowledge sharing between both institutions.<\/p> <p> The expected cost of membership for Ireland will be a total of approximately &euro;25 million, spread over a five-year period, depending on prevailing exchange rates.  Ireland has been offered 1,313 shares in the bank.  This figure is based on the remaining unallocated capital in the bank and Ireland's relative GDP share among non-regional countries applying for membership in this round of applications.  In capital terms, this equates to a total subscription of approximately &euro;125 million, split between 80% callable capital and 20% paid in capital.  In practice, this would result in a subscription of approximately &euro;25 million, to which I have referred.  In general, callable capital represents the capital for which a member country would be liable if the institution was to encounter acute financial distress, while paid-in capital is the amount a member country actually contributes to the institution in normal circumstances.  Based on Ireland's membership of existing international financial institutions and the performance of these institutions to date, the probability of the callable capital being called on is negligible.<\/p> <p> A contribution of approximately &euro;25 million would also be broadly in line with our contribution to other international financial institutions, relative to their size.  For example and taking into account the bank's global role, Ireland has paid-in capital in the World Bank of approximately &euro;49 million.  It also has paid-in capital of approximately &euro;15 million in the Asian Development Bank.  Ireland's capital contribution to the AIIB will be sourced from the Central Fund as is normal practice for international financial institutions.  This has been provided for in the legislation.  It is also expected that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the AIIB will count towards the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance, ODA.  The programme for Government commits to continuing efforts to achieve this target as economic circumstances allow.  While it remains to be formally decided whether contributions to the AIIB will count towards the level of ODA, indications are positive that this will be the case.  In December 2016 the secretariat responsible for this issue in the OECD recommended that the AIIB be included in its list of ODA-eligible organisations.  Once details are finalised, AIIB members will be able to count their AIIB contributions, or a significant proportion of them, towards their individual ODA targets.<\/p> <p> I turn now to the specific provisions of the four sections of the Bill.  Section 1 sets out the definitions used in the Bill.  <\/p> <p> Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of agreement for membership of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  The articles of agreement establishing the bank are set out in a Schedule to the Bill.  Section 3 sets out the financial and other provisions associated with joining the bank.  <\/p> <p> Section 4 deals with the Short Title of the Bill.  It also provides for the commencement of the provisions in section 3 on the day the State will become a member of the AIIB.<\/p> <p> I strongly recommend Ireland's membership of the AIIB.  The bank will make a significant contribution to economic prosperity and regional integration in Asia.  Ireland's active participation in the AIIB will further strengthen our ties with this region, with expected benefits in trade links and possible procurement opportunities.  Membership will be in line with Ireland's strong commitment to international development and I am confident that the AIIB will be an effective channel in that regard.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800027#Z00600","speaker":"1326","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495118400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Before I address the Bill, I note that the Minister has made a significant statement today that he will not seek reappointment to his current post when a new Taoiseach takes office.

People looking in and members of society in general might validly ask why it is in Ireland's national interest to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.  When one looks at Ireland's strategic interests, economic development and deepening trade relations with many Asian countries, however, it becomes clear that it is certainly in our interests as a country to join.<\/p><p>There is, of course, a cost to this, which is &euro;25 million over a five year period.  In the context of the level of trade we have and which we aspire to have with the Asian economy it is a modest investment, which will pay a very rich return to the country.  To take one example in terms of our trading relationship with China alone, which the Minister has put on the record, in 2015 bilateral trade between Ireland and China reached &euro;11 billion.  It is significant trade.  In the context of Brexit, at a time when we are trying to diversify market penetration for so many Irish firms that are quite dependent on the UK economy and the UK market, having a foothold in Asia fits in very well with the objectives to lessen this dependence in terms of our trade with the UK and to diversify and widen our market penetration.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has had quite an engagement on the Asian front in the area of financial services and I am sure he will speak about this over the course of the debate on the Bill.  It is a very important area for our country as we seek to attract further investment in the area of financial services.<\/p> <p> I note the Minister for Finance of the day will become a governor of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank so Ireland will have a seat at the table, and this is to be welcomed.  In addition, I note we will be part of a constituency of euro area member states, where Ireland will have a turn on the board of directors in terms of the more day to day operational element of the bank.  It is very important to have influence at this level so we can ensure the activities of the bank meet the strategic objectives of our economy and what we seek to achieve.<\/p> <p> I note from the Minister's speech that it is the objective of the Government that the contribution of &euro;25 million will be recognised as part of Ireland's overseas development aid requirement, which is 0.7% of GNP, and while this issue has not been finally determined, it is likely it will meet the test to form part of the contribution.  It is fitting and appropriate this would be the case given the nature of the activity in which the bank will be involved, for example, in the areas of energy and developing better infrastructure, including transport infrastructure.  Looking at various projects that have already been approved by the bank, it is fair to say those investments will help to develop the Asian economy and, in turn, will help to create significant opportunities for Irish firms.<\/p> <p> The trade missions to Asia in recent years, which have been led by various Ministers and heavily supported by Enterprise Ireland and other State agencies, have been successful.  There is an economic dividend for the European Union and particularly for Ireland in ensuring the Asian economy continues to be developed and that infrastructure bottlenecks there are addressed.  Irish firms will not just develop export opportunities but will also directly provide services as part of projects which will be funded by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.<\/p> <p> The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a very new bank.  I have to say I did not know a whole lot about it until I started researching it in anticipation of the debate today.  China will be the most significant player, along with India and other countries in Asia.  It is operated on a multilateral basis.  I note and welcome the level of co-operation that exists between the new bank and other international institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank.  The fact Ireland has a vice president of the European Investment Bank in the form of Andrew McDowell presents an excellent opportunity for Ireland to develop stronger relations through this channel with this new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.<\/p> <p> The Bill itself is quite short and, in effect, what we are doing is providing for the approval of the articles of agreement of the new bank and consent for the payments to be made.  We should ensure there is a proper reporting mechanism and that Ireland's involvement in the bank is accounted for, and I suggest, for example, this be a standing item on the agenda in the finance committee.  At least every year we should be given an update on the work of this bank and Ireland's role in this regard, and we should seek to measure in so far as we can what the economic benefits are to Ireland as a result of being directly involved in and being a member of the bank.  I will leave my opening remarks at that.  I welcome the Bill.  We look forward to Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Bill.  We support the Bill and we look forward to the remainder of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800028#AA00400","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495119000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance on the announcement of his retirement from that role.  The Minister for Finance and I have a very different world view in nearly every respect politically, but it is obvious he has played a very strong role in Fine Gael over the years.  He has been a mainstay of the Fine Gael Party since I was a child and no doubt he had a very settling effect on the Fine Gael Party every time it got little bit giddy over recent years.  I wish him well in his retirement and many happy years with his family.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill.  My party is an internationalist one and believes the State should play a full role in development across the world.  We are members of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which are the American and Japanese dominated development banks, so there would be no reason to shun the Chinese equivalent.<\/p><p>For some time I have been asking the Minister about when our application would be progressed.  In April 2015, when the bank was founded, my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, asked the Minister if Ireland would join.  At that point, Deputy Doherty was told that no decisions had been taken or proposed in the matter.  At that point, Britain, Germany, France and practically all other European countries had joined or indicated they would join as founding members.  The agreement is clear that founding members enjoy special privileges in nominating and voting for directors.  Most of our neighbours will have these privileges but Ireland will not.  Unfortunately, the country hesitated and dithered and we were nearly left behind.  By delaying our application for no good reason we have put this country at a tactical disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is not clear why we delayed but the possibility exists that American sensitivities might have been behind it.  American Nobel Prize winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, thinks our sensitivity is misplaced, saying:<\/p><blockquote>In fact, America&rsquo;s opposition to the AIIB is inconsistent with its stated economic priorities in Asia.  Sadly, it seems to be another case of America's insecurity about its global influence trumping its idealistic rhetoric &ndash; this time possibly undermining an important opportunity to strengthen Asia's developing economies.<\/blockquote><p>I cannot see any good reason a decision was not taken until December 2015.  Hopefully, there will be no further disadvantages because of this.  What matters ultimately is that the right decision was made.  Asia is a huge part of the world with massive concentrations of population.  Its economic potential compared to Europe is very large.  Good trade links with China in agriculture and other areas in particular are essential to our export sector.  As the Minister told Deputy Doherty last June:<\/p><blockquote>Bilateral trade has grown in significance and, in 2014, Ireland's total trade with China was worth over &euro;8 billion.  Ireland's priorities relate to bilateral trade and investment, particularly: higher education; agrifood; tourism; and aviation-financing sectors.<\/blockquote><p>The economic rationale for joining is clear, but it should not have been the only rationale.  I note the articles of agreement state, &quot;The Bank shall ensure that each of its operations complies with the Bank's operational and financial policies, including without limitation, policies addressing environmental and social impacts.&quot;  That is, presumably, a very weak sop to those of us who argue for investment that respect human rights and environmental protections.  We cannot ignore such issues when we are talking about what is effectively a Chinese bank.  Many of the countries that are the likely recipients of investments have issues with minorities or national rights that must be taken into account.<\/p><p>The European Parliament has noted that, \"so far the AIIB&rsquo;s governance structures do not foresee adequate involvement of shareholders in project financing decisions, and that the publicly available project documentation lacks any detail on the fulfilment of the environmental and social measures that the AIIB requires from its lenders\".  We should not shirk from those questions.  I believe on this occasion it is a case of being better off inside the tent than outside it.  As Dr. Stiglitz stated: \"Moreover, the need for environmental and social safeguards in infrastructure investment is more likely to be addressed effectively within a multilateral framework\".  Irish investment should be monitored to ensure our investment is not being pumped into projects that do not respect social, human and environmental rights.<\/p> <p> The policy decision for me is clear, but we should not forget that this is not just a matter of signing an agreement.  We have to put our money where our mouth is.  The Minister told Deputy Doherty last week - perhaps he has updated figures - that Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the AIIB could result in a charge of some &euro;50 million on the Exchequer based on projected annual payments of &euro;10 million per annum for five years.  Looking at the figures in the schedule of the contribution made by other similar countries, that seems on the low side.  Denmark, for example is down for &euro;369.5 million and Finland is down for &euro;310 million.  Is this country trying to get in on the cheap?  This is not an insignificant investment for a country of our size.  It is only right that it is debated here and requires our approval.<\/p> <p> When we dealt with the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill, we made the point, which was accepted through our amendment, that when we sign off on international agreements, it is not good enough to have the D&aacute;il sign off once and that changes to what we agreed can then be made without further approval.  There is a question of how practical D&aacute;il approval for change might be, but I would tend to err on the cautious side.  In the Single Resolution Board (Loan Facility Agreement) Bill, the issue was that a call on this State to provide more money could be made beyond what was agreed without the D&aacute;il having to approve such a change.<\/p> <p> We have strict rules over the money that can be spent in Bills, which I believe is an archaic system, yet when it comes to an international trade agreement, a blank cheque can be written.  We will review the provisions in this Bill to see if an amendment is required to tighten up the Oireachtas oversight.  Development banks are good.  We should use them far more often.  Our take-up of European Investment Bank funding is a disgrace.  It remains far too low, even during the current housing crisis.  There is a huge chasm between where our capital investment is and where it needs to be.  We support this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800029#BB00200","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495119600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>The Asian Infrastructure Development Bank is one of a number of development banks around the world with which Ireland is associated, the biggest ones being the IMF, the European Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the founding of which I believe was heavily influenced by the Japanese, just as this one is heavily influenced in its establishment by the Government of China.<\/p>  <p>  In looking at development banks as a model, one has to ask who the development infrastructures are for.  In this respect, and I do not think this was addressed in the Minister's contribution, what we have to look at in terms of the developing countries of Asia is that the number of girls who are in education is depressingly small.  I am not including the very developed countries in Asia in that, but the failure of girls to be at school and to receive education is probably one of the greatest issues that can affect a country in terms of retarding its progress and development.  I would like to know from the Minister, and from the officials in the Department of Finance and those people who will service Ireland's participation in the agency, what exactly is the development ethos that will influence Ireland's stance regarding this bank when it gets under way.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue in regard to women is that in many countries in Asia, far more is spent on armaments than is spent on women's general development.  I worked in Africa for a number of years.  I was back recently on a private visit to Tanzania, in east Africa.  Any country which seeks to have development without an intense and full participation by women will not succeed, nor will any kind of attractive society emerge as a product.  It is also likely to be a much more unequal society, and it may well be an intensely patriarchal society.  We also know that there are different forces in the world who object strenuously to girls barely getting any education at all, so we need to know the underlying approach to development in terms of the Department of Finance and the mandarins who inevitably will be guiding Ireland's participation in this bank.<\/p>  <p>  The third issue is how the bank, and Ireland's potential contribution to the bank, will be utilised so as to help to deliver services to the people who are the poorest in society.  By and large, that is women and children.  While the references in the material regarding the bank mention not only economic but social progress, I challenge the Minister and the civil servants to set out specifically, in terms of Ireland's long record in working in developing countries, how our participation in the bank will meet our own tradition of assisting in development in a way that is balanced and that takes into account the poorest people in any society, and not only the rich men in society but, in particular, women and children.  When we move beyond that category, by and large we are also talking about people in rural areas often being extremely poor in terms of resources.  That is one question the Minister must answer.<\/p>  <p>  The other question the Minister must answer is to give us a picture of how this bank will operate.  Will it be an applications bank to which various countries will apply for funding?  Will the funding be dictated by the bank or will the applications come from the bottom up?  Development banks have a great capacity to influence, for the good, the development of infrastructure that serves whole societies and regions in a fair way.  Equally, if it was to turn out to be just a boys' club, it could be something that would be utilised on an exclusive basis.  We know, for instance, that China has made reference to having various initiatives such as a recreation, in modern highway terms, of the old Silk Route, going back to the time of Marco Polo and earlier in Chinese history, and strengthening the transport links by road and possibly by rail between Asia and Europe.  We need to spell out exactly what the bank is likely to do.  What is its vision statement?  What is its statement regarding countries such as Nepal, where there is a crying need for development and infrastructure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800030#CC00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495119600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1495120200,"counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800031#DD00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","time":1495120200,"counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800031#DD00300"},{"type":"question","time":1495120200,"counter":187,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[23771\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800031#DD00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the review of Exchequer tax revenue in view of 2017 tax revenue to April coming in &euro;344 million under target, with specific reference to the shortfall in income tax, including the universal social charge, USC, corporation tax and excise; his views on the possibility of this persisting throughout 2017; the potential impact on the deficit for 2017; the potential impact on the fiscal space in 2018; if he revised the fiscal space; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1495120200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>This question relates to the Exchequer returns and, in particular, to the shortfall we have seen under a number of different tax headings so far this year.

In terms of the \"big four\" tax headings, corporation tax, income tax and excise duties recorded shortfalls against profile, but VAT was ahead of expectations.  Corporation tax receipts of &euro;587 million were collected to the end of April.  As a result, cumulative revenues were down 27.6%, or &euro;223 million, against target.  It is important to point out that Exchequer receipts from corporation tax can vary throughout the year and just over 10% of the total annual receipts was expected in the first four months of the year.  By comparison, over 60% of corporation tax receipts are expected during May, June and November.  Due to the non-linear nature of corporation tax receipts, the potential for company-specific factors and the low proportion of the annual receipts received to date, it would be premature to draw any conclusions about corporation tax at this stage of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Income tax receipts to the end of April were 3.1%, or &euro;198 million, below profile.  It is important to point out that income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments.  These include deposit interest retention tax, life assurance exit tax, dividend withholding tax, professional services withholding tax and back duty.  These payments, by their nature, can be non-linear and timing can vary from year to year.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of these specific components were causing a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first four months of 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the performance of the USC is lower than expected, and my Department is currently reviewing its performance, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.  The initial indications are that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the overall estimate of the budget 2017 package in respect of USC changes was costed accurately at &euro;335 million.  At the time of budget 2017, the apportionment of the total USC package between PAYE and schedule D was expected to be &euro;263 million and &euro;72 million, respectively, in line with previous norms.  However, subsequent analysis by the Revenue Commissioners indicates that the allocations of the USC package between PAYE and schedule D should have been &euro;311 million and &euro;24 million, respectively, due to the dynamics of the USC package.  While, this helps to explain some of the current under-performance against profile for USC paid by PAYE taxpayers, it is important to point out that this reapportionment\u00a0should have no adverse impact on the overall collection of the USC receipts as they should equalise later in the year when self-employed returns are made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800031#DD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1495120200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Following a competitive tender process, Indecon Economic Consultants were appointed in April to undertake this impact assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This purpose of this project, in general,\u00a0is\u00a0to assess whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, what impact, if any, the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices, and what impact the scheme is having on the residential property market generally.  It is expected that the assessment will be completed\u00a0and submitted to me by the end of\u00a0August.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy's queries concerning the uptake and cost of the incentive, there are\u00a0two stages involved in\u00a0the help-to-buy\u00a0process.  Stage 1 is the application stage, wherein prospective applicants can query whether they qualify for the incentive.  They can also get clarity on the maximum amount of rebate they could potentially\u00a0benefit from, based on their tax paid in a four-year period.  Stage 2 is the claims stage, wherein applicants that decide to proceed with purchasing or building\u00a0a qualifying property must provide documentary evidence of the relevant\u00a0property transaction or their mortgage drawdown.<\/p>  <p>  As of\u00a0Thursday, 11 May\u00a02017, Revenue had received 6,084 applications to stage 1 of the help-to-buy incentive, of which 3,621 have been approved.  However, it is possible that many of these applicants may never make a claim to stage 2 for a variety of reasons. These could include individuals who\u00a0do not\u00a0go on\u00a0to obtain\u00a0mortgage approval, who may decide to purchase a second-hand property, or who are not able to source the new home that they desire.<\/p>  <p>  To date, 1,677\u00a0stage 2\u00a0claims have been made, of which, 1,154\u00a0have been approved, at a total estimated cost to the Exchequer of just over\u00a0&euro;17 million.  This cost\u00a0covers almost 70% of the stage 2 claims made to date. \u00a0Using this as a base,\u00a0it could be estimated that a further &euro;5 million remains outstanding in respect of\u00a0these claims.  This would bring the cost to just over &euro;22 million, which\u00a0relates to\u00a0the scheme being available in respect of relevant homes over an 11-month period.  Given that just over seven months remain in 2017, my officials estimate that the cost of the incentive this year\u00a0will\u00a0largely be in line with the original estimate of &euro;50 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800032#EE00600","speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1495120800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister his reply and for the updated numbers.

The supply of houses is not sufficient to meet demand.  Housing demand is not a lot of people who want houses; housing demand is a lot of people who want houses and can put the money up to buy them.  It is much more likely that the hugely increased activity in the mortgage market is contributing to the additional demand driving up prices than anything in the help-to-buy scheme.  A sum of &euro;22 million is neither here nor there as an injection over an 11-month period into house purchasing.  If that is compared to the billions of euro that have been authorised in mortgages, the Deputy can see the relativities.  There is no doubt that additional money leading to money demand tends to drive up prices but the amount provided under the help-to-buy scheme is relatively small in comparison to the credit and savings available in the market.  There is significant increased money demand for houses now.

Non-first-time buyers requires a 20% deposit, which is &euro;80,000, but they cannot access the scheme.  That is a significant distortion of the market.

The focus of the review was where there was a possible detriment to consumers from unsuitable sales resulting in premiums being refunded.  The review covered 11 firms and covered all PPI sales from 1 July 2007.

The Central Bank is aware of this non-disclosure issue from previous supervisory engagements.

This is another reason why we need to expedite that legislation.  What I would like to hear from the Minister of State is his concern to create awareness with regard to this institution for thousands of customers.  Let me explain what it did.  It sold payment protection insurance to individuals, claiming that it had no interest in the underwriter, when it owned 100% of the underwriting insurance business.  One other insurance company which we own 75% of had a similar case.

I will read out the prepared reply first and then we can discuss it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has published\u00a0a comprehensive document on Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on 2 May.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's position in regard to the Border with Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit is very clear - continued freedom of movement, absence of a hard border, and minimal impact on business and trade are key objectives. \u00a0Clearly, in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU is more generally the better.<\/p>  <p>  I would point out that the guidelines for the EU 27 Article 50 negotiation framework, agreed by the heads of state and government on 29 April, specifically refer to the need to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the guidelines recognise the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, outlining the need for flexible and imaginative solutions, including the aim of avoiding a hard border, while respecting the integrity of the union's legal order.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has welcomed the EU&rsquo;s negotiating guidelines as reflecting Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns and priorities.  They express the EU&rsquo;s continued support for the peace process and the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  They acknowledge the need for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  They agree to the recognition of existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the UK and Ireland, which are compatible with EU law, such as the common travel area.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also secured the agreement of its EU counterparts on the need to recognise the unique constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the need to ensure that should a united Ireland be brought about in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would be part of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  This is a positive outcome, showing that the Government&rsquo;s extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign of recent months has been effective in ensuring the understanding and recognition of our unique circumstances and specific issues.<\/p>  <p>  Like all Government agencies, the Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged in examining a range of scenarios in order to support Ireland's objectives. \u00a0The precise arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations which will now take place between the EU and UK.<\/p>  <p>  This is a political issue, which will require a creative political solution.  It is not helpful to pre-empt any particular outcome at this early stage of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800034#GG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"speech","time":1495122000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Yesterday's exchange at the committee was illuminating, although it was like pulling teeth.  However, it did establish some facts that some of us, at least, knew were the case.  Mr. Barnier told us last week that there would be consequences of Brexit for the Border.  Of course there will be consequences and some type of Border posts or customs posts will be in place, even if they are not quite on the Border and even if, as the Revenue says, they will be called trade facilitation stations instead of custom posts.  Of course there will be disruption and delays to people and goods crossing the Border when one side of the Border is in a customs union and the other side is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051800034#GG00900","speaker":"1288"}]
