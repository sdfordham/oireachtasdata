We thank the Committee of Public Accounts for the invitation to address it.  The public services committee of ICTU is always happy to assist the committee in any way it can.  <\/p><p>  While all potential savings in public expenditure are important, the savings the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform seeks to achieve on foot of its review of allowances comprise a relatively small proportion of the overall savings and reforms being delivered by public servants and their unions under the public service agreement.  The implementation body for the agreement reports that the agreement has achieved annual recurring savings of almost &euro;1.5 billion in its first two years and is on track to achieve recurring annual savings of &euro;3.8 billion gross, or &euro;3.3 billion net when the additional pension costs associated with people retiring from the public service are taken into account, by 2015.  We would be happy to comment on recent erroneous media reports that questioned the veracity of the verified savings being delivered under the agreement, even if that is not the direct subject of this hearing.<\/p><p>  I would like to give some background information on the allowances.  Almost all public servants are on pay scales that reflect the agreed rate for the job, minus the 2010 pay cuts and the so-called pension levy, which together have reduced pay by an average of 14%.  Any allowance or premium payment paid on top of these rates was introduced - sometimes many years ago - to reflect additional skills, qualifications or responsibilities over and above the normal requirements of the job.  In other cases, large groups of staff in a relatively small number of grades have seen allowances introduced during the years to reflect the wide range of duties and specialisms within these grades.  Most importantly from a management point of view, the payment of allowances ensures awards for additional duties and responsibilities can be confined to those staff members who carry them out without the need for promotions or the creation of new grades.  Various allowances paid to certain groups of staff are pensionable or have come to account for a significant portion of the income of the staff in question.  In many such cases the allowances have come to be considered by staff and management as core pay.  In some cases allowances are used by management to avoid costs.  Acting up allowances, for example, are sometimes paid to staff who take on the duties and responsibilities associated with a vacant higher grade post.  During the years this has frequently been used as an alternative to a promotion that would result in a higher salary and pension commitment.  The cost of allowances is falling as public service staff numbers continue to decline.<\/p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform announced the outcome of its review of public service allowances on 18 September and made a further statement in October.  The review had initially been established by the Department as a management review in December 2011.  It was not conducted under the processes of the public service agreement.  Neither the public services committee of ICTU nor any individual trade union made submissions to the review process.  We were not invited to do so.  There was no negotiation with unions on the content, objectives, timetable or terms of reference for the review.  The Department instructed all Government offices and Departments to report to it on the allowances paid and make a business case for those allowances they believed should continue to be paid to new beneficiaries - staff who were newly hired, promoted or assigned to duties that attracted an allowance before now.  The publicly stated objective of the review was to facilitate a 10% reduction in spending on allowances and premium payments by 2014.  Our understanding was that it was intended that the review would lead to the abolition of certain allowances, particularly to new beneficiaries, to help to meet this target.  No allowances were paid to new beneficiaries from the end of January 2012 pending the outcome of the review.<\/p><p>  The review was not supposed to end all allowances and premium payments.  According to the letter the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sent to Departments and agencies to announce the review, the Minister believed allowances which reflected work of additional value or the arduous nature or unsocial hours of certain duties and posts remained valid, appropriate and cost-effective.  The letter also stated certain allowances might have been overtaken by developments in qualifications, duties, skills and normal flexibilities now expected or required in public service employment.  At the beginning of the review the public services committee of ICTU was informed that it would identify three types of allowance or premium payment - those that would be discontinued because the business case for them was not made or deemed too weak, those that would continue because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform accepted the business case for them and those for which more information would be required from departmental management before a final decision could be made.  We were also told any change would respect the public service agreement and that there would be full consultation with staff representatives at central and sectoral level.<\/p><p>  Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sent a letter to the public services committee of ICTU to emphasise that any initiative which would arise from the review would be advanced in compliance with the terms of the Croke Park agreement, having regard to the primary commitments given by the Government under the agreement.  We took this to mean that while unions would have no part to play in the review, they would be able to contest through the arbitration procedures of the public service agreement any decision to discontinue an allowance.  These processes are time-limited and binding on all parties.  In such a situation our expectation was that independent arbitrators would have to consider whether the abolition or amendment of an allowance was permitted under the agreement.  Although this has not yet been tested, we expected that the outcome of an adjudication would largely depend on whether the abolition of an allowance would lead to cost savings, whether the purpose for which the allowance had been introduced was continuing, whether the allowance formed a significant element of the overall remuneration of the beneficiary and whether the allowance could be defined as core pay, in which case it would be protected by the Croke Park agreement.<\/p><p>  Our initial understanding was that the intention of the review was to facilitate the permanent cessation of certain allowances to new beneficiaries only.<\/p> <p>However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made a number of statements during the course of 2012 in which he suggested some allowances currently paid to existing staff may also be affected.  The announcement of 18 September 2012 included the cessation of one allowance for existing staff and the further review of the continued payment to existing staff of a large number of others.  The statement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the outcome of its review listed allowances under three headings, which differed from its original letter to the Departments and to Government offices.  First, allowances to be abolished which would apply to new beneficiaries -  that is, new entrants - promoted staff and staff newly assigned to the relevant duty.  Second, the allowances to be approved for new beneficiaries but which will be subject to review and or moderation.  Third, allowances to be approved for new beneficiaries as well as for existing staff.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's statement of October 2012 further underlined the Government's intention to cease paying certain allowances to staff who currently receive them.<\/p><p> I draw a distinction between allowances, overtime and premium payments.  It is worth adding that the grouping together of allowances, overtime and premium payments has confused public understanding of what was under review and what the review set out to achieve.  In fact, it has been a review of allowances, not a review of overtime, or premium payments, which are additional payments received by some public service grades sometimes at higher rates than basic pay for working additional time over and above contracted hours.  While there are many examples where the public service agreement has successfully been used to reduce the incidence and cost of overtime and premium payments, usually through the revision of rosters, the extension of working time, this was not actually part of the Department's review of allowances.<\/p><p> In October 2012, Departments and Government offices were instructed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to open talks with unions about the abolition of some allowances currently paid to existing public servants.  The 88 named allowances were drawn from a list of over 100 which were abolished for new beneficiaries when the Government announced the outcome of its review on 18 September.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform set the 28 October 2013 as the deadline for talks to conclude.  The October 2012 instruction to open talks with unions represented the first proposed involvement of trade unions in the process.  In some cases talks between the individual employers and unions concerned have now commenced through the appropriate industrial relations machinery.<\/p><p> Committee members will also be aware that the Payment of Wages Act 1991 protects all employees, regardless of which sector in which they work, and prevents employers from unilaterally making deductions from wages that are deemed to be \"properly payable\".  This includes allowances, unless the basis for payment has disappeared or an industrial relations process has concluded that the allowance is no longer justified.  The congress public services committee is not directly involved in these talks as they are a matter for the individual employers and the unions concerned.  For this reason we are not in a position to engage with the Committee of Public Accounts on the arguments for and against specific allowances.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has also indicated its desire for a fast-track process not least because of fear that adjudications on allowances would represent a significant additional workload for the already stretched adjudication institutions, in particular the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Unions have said that they will consider a fast-track process when the details are tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shay Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351692600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Cody.

If an allowance was appropriate for a particular duty and somebody was promoted into it or moved sideways into it, they would not receive it either.  I draw that distinction between new recruits and existing staff.  We have taken the view that if a union disputes the position of the management, whether it is with regard to existing beneficiaries or indeed new beneficiaries, it is open to those unions to take the matter to a third party to argue that the allowance should be paid.  Clearly they are going to have to stand up such an argument, that is, justify that the circumstances that gave rise to the allowance continue in the main, and therefore, there is a good case to argue for the continuation of it, not just for serving staff but for new people.  We have not agreed to, or engaged around drawing up the moat as has been painted.  The first opportunity the trade unions have had to engage with this matter was at the beginning of October.  We would expect that in some or many cases, unions will argue directly with the employer and before a third party, if need be, that allowances should be paid to new beneficiaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shay Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1351692600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Has Mr. Cody formed an opinion on how to approach the issue when the union may have formed an opinion it should be discontinued?

Other local authorities had been taking a similar approach to that of Cavan County Council.  They were deciding they were under huge budgetary pressure and needed to do what needed to be done for their books.  Nobody disputes the fact they have significant issues with regard to their budgets.  However, for the past two and a half years they have gone after these people and taken money from their pockets.<\/p><p>  To return to the Deputy's first point, I represent these workers and deal directly with them in many cases, but I have yet to find a council worker who will tell me I should go in and tell the man in charge he can take his or her money.  Chances are it is only &euro;12, &euro;10 or &euro;5, but if a person is on a wage which after 40 years provides a maximum of &euro;28,000 and someone suggests the way to save the local authority is to remove that person's &euro;12 eating-on-site allowance, the person will not be happy about that.  The reason for an eating-on-site allowance is that if one lives in place A and must get to place B to clear the drains or do whatever one is asked, there is no canteen there and no facility to make tea or go to the toilet.  This is local authority work that people are asked to do.  Many decades ago, we negotiated an eating-on-site allowance for such people, to try to ensure they could buy or bring the necessities with them or pay for the extra petrol they might need to drive to where the work is.  In my county of Wicklow, a big county, if someone who operates from Greystones is told to do work in Glencree the next morning, that means a journey of 15 miles, with no bus service and no other way of getting there.  The eating-on-site allowance must cover that.  That is what it is about.  Therefore, a county manager should not be able to just walk in and decide that because his budget is in difficulty, he can take that money from the worker.  This causes a huge problem for the worker and we will contest that.  The question may be asked as to whether this payment is core pay.  We will argue strongly that it is core pay and part and parcel of what constitutes that person's wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1351693800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I presume the union negotiated that position in the context of the discussions that took place that resulted in the Croke Park agreement.

It happens in the health sector in the support grades, in catering, in portering and in security.

There is a broader context, but that is not a matter for us to consider today.  Is the definition of core pay dictated by the vintage of an allowance and the percentage in terms of overall pay for an individual public or civil servant?

Allowances can be paid to either individuals or small groups and, frankly, it would not be tenable for us to argue that they are part of core pay, but it would be tenable for us to argue that they were justified.  For example, in the support grades in the Civil Service some staff are in receipt of a key holder allowance, in other words, they can be called in early or late to open a building if, say, there is an alarm going off.  Everybody does not receive the allowance.  It would not be possible to argue that it was part of core pay, yet at the same time the Minister has accepted that because it is a particular duty and responsibility that must be performed, the allowance should continue to be paid, not only to existing beneficiaries but also to future beneficiaries.<\/p><p>  To deal with the issue of core pay, if an allowance is paid to all or almost all staff and has been seen as part of the remuneration package, whether it is described as an allowance on top of basic pay or as being part of core pay, it is part of the way one remunerates somebody.  A classic example - the one which has been used on many occasions - is that of school principals.  For some odd reason, they are on a salary and in receipt of a school principal's allowance, whereas if they worked anywhere else, they would be on a consolidated salary for the grade of school principal.

There was a lot of media comment about a shoe allowance paid to some service officers in the Civil Service and jokey comments around it.

It was only payable to those who had a uniform and it was found it was much cheaper to give people &euro;65 to buy their own shoes rather than having a store of shoes that would be ill-fitting and would require the existence of some sort of logistics department with different shoes in it.  Sometimes allowances make complete sense from the employer's point of view.  Workers did not ever unilaterally - if I can call it that - impose allowances on the system.  They came by way of agreement.  In some cases they came by way of management initiatives, such as the example in which management decided it was a hell of a lot more cost-effective to allow workers to buy their own shoes rather than supplying them as part of the uniform, as happens in some bigger services such as the Garda and the Army.  That goes back to the 1930s and, frankly, I do not think there is a better system in place.  It is obviously relatively small beer - although &euro;65 a year is a lot more money for somebody who is on a very modest salary than for somebody who is a county manager - but it makes absolute sense from the employer's point of view that it supply the uniform in the most cost-effective way it can.

I hope we can put together a good report following on from this.<\/p><p>  I have seen positive changes in the teaching practices of teachers, but what really frustrates me and many teachers to whom I have spoken is the fact that teachers are not allowed to spend the additional hours they must now spend in school because of the Croke Park agreement with students.  There is a knock-on effect whereby the mathematics teacher who for the past 20 years has given the extra hour on a Wednesday afternoon is no longer in a position to do so.  Was it the union's position or that of the Croke Park implementation group that the extra hours had to be spent on planning, meetings and the like?  Obviously, there is a role for that but I am worried by it and have seen anecdotal evidence of it in respect of extracurricular activities and grinds, for want of a better word, that teachers have provided.  There is possibly a better way in which some of those Croke Park hours could be spent.  That is certainly the message I am hearing from teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100012#L00100","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351697400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I am not sure whether Deputy Harris is referring to primary or post-primary education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sheila Nunan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351697400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I am referring to post-primary education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100012#L00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351697400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I am not absolutely familiar with some of the difficulties arising there.

It is quite specific in terms of mostly administrative matters.  The activities that are covered in the additional hour are governed by circular.  It was never intended for it to be an additional teaching hour because, as the Deputy knows, schools have become very complex environments, requiring everything from administrative to curriculum development work, and the hour has been used for that.

Representatives of a number of workers and, obviously, officials from a number of Departments have appeared before the committee.  The Army is one group that sticks in my mind, along with maintenance workers, caretakers and the like.  We are talking about many people who are low-paid, embarrassingly so in some cases.  Let us take the example of the Army, although I know ICTU does not represent it.  Here one finds people earning less than the minimum wage.  Rather than grasping the public sector pay nettle and trying to find a solution, we as a State just decided to throw allowances at them.  Instead of saying that a person doing job X deserves to earn salary Y, we did what seems to me to be a uniquely Irish thing of giving that person an allowance.  As a result, one sees many public servants, many of whom I meet, who are almost embarrassed by the fact that it is called an allowance, because it is incorrect, but who are also earning  low salaries.  Obviously, I hold the Government, successive Governments and all of us involved in civic life accountable for that but, equally, do the trade unions not bear some of the responsibility?  Ms Nunan will have to help me out because we are going back some way in respect of some of these allowances, which predate many of ICTU's own appointments.  Did the trade unions not sit around the table and agree this system of allowances?  Did the trade union movement in its various guises ever jump up and down and say that we did not need an allowance but needed to get to the bottom of the problem?  Did it ever say that what we need is not 1,100 allowances but rather to give some of those people decent salaries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100012#L00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351697400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>That is probably where the debate started.  The Deputy will recall that in the past there was quite considerable agitation, originally among the spouses of soldiers before soldiers were allowed to have their own association.  It was a campaign about low pay so the workers and their associations subsequently argued for resolution of the low pay issue.  There was always a fear on the management side - not in the Department of Defence but in the Department of Finance and probably, today, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - that if one did something for the Army, that might have implications elsewhere.  That is how the device of allowances emerged in many cases.  When representing soldiers who had an offer of some improvement in their conditions by way of an allowance, people were told that hell would freeze over before a formal pay increase would be given to them, so they ended up making a pragmatic judgment, particularly in circumstances in which there was no firestorm of media abuse about allowances.<\/p><p>  We now find allowances routinely described as perks, bonuses and benefits, whereas Deputy Harris is 100% correct in stating that they were simply a way of building up something by way of a remuneration package that in private sector companies is usually made up of salary plus bonus plus, possibly, share options.  The public service came up with its own myriad of different inputs because of a fear of knock-on consequences.  This was not an issue until somebody started describing these arrangements as unearned bonuses and, frankly, abusing them, which is not fair or reasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100012#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shay Cody"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351697400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Deputy Harris may have his own view of the role of trade unions and what they did or did not do, to which he is perfectly entitled.  When a trade union representative made a case on behalf of a person or group, one could take it that this claim would be for a wage increase.  It would not be that the person or group should get something bolted on to the side of their rate of pay which would have a degree of insecurity attached to it.  I would be more inclined to say that some of the allowances are a demonstration of the lack of success in getting the rate of pay consolidated, rather than the way in which Deputy Harris has portrayed it.<\/p><p>  The Deputy and I have something in common.  I was born and reared in the county represented by the Deputy and I would say we come across some of the same types of people.  If I was to tell the Deputy about some of the public servants I know, with whom the Deputy probably engages, the vast majority would be on the lower end of the scale.  Apart from the embarrassment, they are concerned about the level of uncertainty attached to the rate and what will happen to the next piece of their pay.  I am sure all of those people would say that to the Deputy.<\/p><p>  There are a variety of reasons over the decades for this situation.  Deputy Harris is correct in noting that I do not remember them all, but I must admit I probably remember some of them more than the Deputy.  Among the issues were pay, recruitment embargoes and all sorts of instruments used by successive Governments to curtail the public service pay bill, although not in the way it is currently being done.  However, there were methodologies in place and providing allowances to groups of people for particular circumstances was a way of dealing with the fact that pay was warranted but the pay bill could not rise.  The people in the Department of Finance were familiar with the computations and what they told the world about the pay bill and whether it included just salaries or salaries and allowances and all that good stuff.  However, that is why we are where we are.  It is a combination, over decades, of ways and means that people found to deal with particular exigencies that had to be dealt with.  That is basically what we are dealing with here.  That is why I am telling the Deputy that the consolidation argument will not be easy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100012#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speech","time":1351697400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>No, it will not.  We have heard that from both officials and union representatives.  Certainly, the message I get from the people Ms King talks about in my constituency is that they want it to happen.  Obviously, they want the same amount of money in their pockets at the end of the week.  That is normal, and it is ICTU's job to protect that interest.  They want a situation whereby their core pay is not called an allowance because they view it as their core pay.<\/p> <p>On that much we can probably agree.<\/p><p> Mr. Geraghty was never asked for a submission.  Had he been asked, could it hypothetically have contained A, B or C?  If we could continue with that hypothesis for a moment.  During this examination, I have divided allowances into approximately three categories in my mind.  First, an allowance that is a payment for extra responsibilities, qualifications and additional work, which would also be the case in the private sector.  One would do a job in a company, get promoted or be given extra responsibility.  Teaching is the simplest example.  A teacher is given a post of responsibility and is given an allowance.  That is core pay.<\/p><p> Second, an allowance that is an expense.  Be it for shoes or something else, it relates to costs incurred while going about one's daily job.  It is fine that some of these are met by expenses.<\/p><p> The third category could be broken down into section upon section, but when colleagues and I have asked about some allowances, paper started flying while the raft of officials tried to find out what the allowances were about.  The recipients are not making fortunes from their allowances.  As Deputy Donohoe stated more eloquently than I could, it is a long tail of small allowances being paid to a few people, for example, for eating in one's workplace, the caretaker in Mayo, etc.  We have looked through a raft of allowances.<\/p><p> Assuming Mr. Geraghty was making a submission, would it not bring more to the table if the allowances that could be consolidated into pay were identified?  I am referring to outdated allowances, even the names of which are damaging to the credibility of the pay of public servants.  Titles such as \"eating at a desk allowance\" or whatever it is called do nothing to serve the needs of workers, let alone anyone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100012#L00800","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351698000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I do not want to interrupt my colleague, but I might correct the Deputy.

A large chunk of public servants are paid badly by any standard, but one will not read about them in the newspapers, see them on television or hear about them in public discourse.  The issue has been suppressed.  The narrative and view created in the public mind is that people in the public service are on a gravy train.  This is not borne out by the facts.<\/p><p>  A question was asked about the allowances' complexity.  A point is worth making, but might be overlooked.  All of the allowances, however they originated, went through a process before their introduction.  For example, unions identified a small group of people who were doing something over and above what would normally be expected of them and they negotiated with the employer.  Often, allowances are a consequence of a third party ruling that the unions' cases stood up.  One cannot consolidate all of them into pay, as some are specific to people who are part of a wider group and paying the entire group for what that small number do would never be accepted.  We might like it if the entire group was paid.  As Ms King stated, some of these allowances might have originated as pay claims that the employer presumably did not accept, leading to a third party ruling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100013#M00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Geraghty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351698000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Without going into detail, I agree with the Chairman on the descriptions.  I examined the eating on site allowance business plan, but it did not describe the allowance.  The explanation offered earlier at this meeting was necessary and I will not hold up the committee by repeating it.  The employer should either provide council workers with canteen facilities at every place of work or provide this allowance.  The employer does not have the wherewithal to provide canteen facilities where someone can eat a lunch and have a cup of tea.  In many cases, the employer does not even have the wherewithal to provide a toilet.  I would argue strongly that the eating on site allowance should be maintained.<\/p><p>  Of the list of allowances given to us by the Department's Secretary General for consideration, I will refer to two in the health sector.  I do not know why the cardiac allowance is on the list.  Had any degree of research been done, the Department would have realised that it was paid to emergency service workers and had already been classified as part of core pay by the Labour Court.  However, the Department has included it on a list of allowances to be removed.<\/p><p>  We were involved in discussions on the agreed transport allowance a number of decades ago.  In the health service, &euro;16 per week is provided to non-professional - this is the description - health care assistants who need to be on a ward at 7.30 a.m. during the weekends.  There is no public transport, yet they are likely to need it to get to work from where they live.  The transport allowance was negotiated to assist them in being at their places of work at a time when there are few ways to get there, yet it is also on the list.  I will argue strongly that it should not be there and that the money should either be consolidated into pay or maintained.  It is a valid payment.  Like me, members might ask why it is on the list.  All of the relevant conversations have yet to take place.  There has been no discussion with any employer, but there has been a diktat in the form of a circular.<\/p> <p>One cannot manage the public sector with circulars or diktats.  I have picked out two allowances on the list where I believe errors were made.  One allowance has already been determined as part of core pay and there is a substantive case for doing the same with the other, which affects thousands of health care assistants.

I am also accompanied from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Ms Oonagh Buckley, principal officer.  <\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman and members for giving me the opportunity to address the committee.  I provided in advance on 12 October information for the committee on allowances in respect of which business cases had been made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In the intervening period further business cases which have relevance to the local government sector have been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, a list of which was provided for the committee secretariat yesterday.  Altogether, the information provided covers common Civil Service allowances which apply in my Department, allowances specific to the Department which apply in Met &Eacute;ireann, allowances which apply across all local authorities and allowances particular to one or more, rather than to all, local authorities.  Total expenditure from the Department's Vote in 2011 was nearly &euro;1.6 billion, of which departmental pay amounted to some &euro;51 million.  The allowances common to Departments generally and those applying in Met &Eacute;ireann totalled &euro;2.5 million in 2011, of which &euro;351,000 related to common Civil Service allowances, while Met &Eacute;ireann accounted for &euro;2.15 million in the main in shift and public holiday allowances.<\/p><p>  Of the 18 general Civil Service allowances paid in the Department in 2011, ten were paid to service officers.  These allowances totalled some &euro;64,000 in 2011.  There were 28 service officers in the Department in 2011 based at five locations.  The allowances were introduced to cover a range of specific additional tasks and, in the main, are legacy type payments to officers in the Department with the lowest basic pay.  The committee has been advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the service officer grade is common to all Departments and that it is intended to review pay and conditions centrally.  <\/p><p>  The remaining allowances are paid to a limited number of officers and reflect a range of legacy issues.  We have reduced the incidence of the payment of some allowances such as in the case of office accommodation and are in discussions with staff representatives regarding some others.  We will continue to focus on this issue as the overall review continues.  <\/p><p>  In regard to Met &Eacute;ireann, the National Meteorological Service is a division of the Department.  Its core task is to monitor Irish weather conditions and prepare and issue weather forecasts and warnings to help protect life and property.  This requires the making of observations and forecasting operations on a 24-7 basis, 365 days a year.  As is the norm in organisations with round-the-clock operations, staff receive shift and public holiday allowances to compensate for the arduous nature of the unsocial working patterns required to deliver Met &Eacute;ireann services.  Shift and public holiday allowances in Met &Eacute;ireann have been in place for decades, with the current arrangements having been initiated in the 1970s.  Shift allowance payments amounted to &euro;1.8 million in 2011, while public holiday payments totalled some &euro;300,000.  <\/p><p>  As regards local authorities, provisional unaudited figures for 2011 indicate that total expenditure was in the region of &euro;7 billion, of which current expenditure represented &euro;4.7 billion.  The local government fund provided for a figure of &euro;790 million or 17% of current expenditure of local authorities in the form of general purpose grants in 2011.  Payroll costs were &euro;1.4 billion in 2011, a reduction from the figure of &euro;1.7 billion in 2008.  Of the figure of &euro;1.4 billion, &euro;61 million or 4% was spent on allowances.  <b><\/b>Local authorities traditionally incur costs on overtime payments and allowances necessitated by the need to fulfil statutory obligations as service providers in areas such as roads, water, fire and emergency services and to ensure compliance with health and safety legislation.<\/p> <p>Work is often done outside normal working hours and conditions.  The sector has been active in assessing and reducing costs since 2008, having reduced staff numbers by almost 25% or 8,600 whole-time equivalents.  There have been overall savings of &euro;830 million.  In the specific area of allowances costs have been reduced by 30%, from &euro;85 million in 2008 to &euro;61 million in 2011.  The &euro;61 million spent on allowances in 2011 was made up of a range of allowances related to the provision of critical services often carried out outside core hours and duties.<\/p><p> As is the case in other sectors, the term \"allowances\" covers a variety of payment types in the sector.  They vary depending on the work, duration, grade and time involved.  Some are intended to reimburse expenses incurred, while others are linked directly with pay.  In most cases the allowance payable was considered to be the least expensive option to deliver a particular service, with the alternative being curtailing or eliminating the service, paying overtime, hiring additional personnel or increasing basic remuneration.<\/p><p> The majority of allowances are paid to outdoor workers at the lower end of the remuneration spectrum in respect of work carried which in most cases must be done out of hours at short notice, at night or at weekends.  The employees concerned do not receive overtime payments when performing these duties.  <\/p><p> Allowances in local authorities fall into two categories.  Those agreed at national level apply across all 34 authorities.  Examples include on-call, ice cast, acting up, unsocial hours and winter maintenance allowance.  Those agreed locally, in most cases to cater for a particular need, apply in more than one local authority where employees work late or come in early to do a particular job, for example, outdoor staff who work in the sewer system in Dublin city.  The majority of the allowances in the sector were introduced following lengthy negotiations between staff and management representatives and many have been the subject of Labour Court decisions.  The flexibility local authorities receive in return for what is often a relatively small outlay is considerable.  Another example is a cleaning allowance where branch librarians, in addition to their core duty, clean libraries out of hours, thus avoiding the hire of specialist cleaners.<\/p><p> In reviewing allowances in the local authority sector my Department considered 217 separate business cases.  They comprised 14 national and 203 local allowances.  Of these, 56 business cases in respect of 14 national and 42 local allowances have been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the basis that the allowance should be payable to new beneficiaries.  The committee has been provided with information on all 56 allowances.  For the balance where there is no approved business case, my Department did not consider that a business case should be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but local authorities have been asked to begin the process of engagement with staff representatives with a view to the elimination of such allowances to existing beneficiaries also.<\/p><p> Overall, as I have indicated, the local authority sector has been to the fore since 2008 in reducing expenditure and staff numbers in response to the financial crisis.  The sector is now embarking on an ambitious structural and organisational reform programme aimed at delivering services more effectively to citizens locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100015#O00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351699800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Tallon.

We decided to ask each local authority to send us a full list of the allowances applied and that we would carry out a review rather than referring all of the business cases directly to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This seemed to be sensible and practical from our point of view to try to isolate the allowances applied nationally across the local government system and we identified 14.  As I said, there were more than 200 allowances that applied in one or more local authorities and we have been looking at all of these cases.  I would not say absolutely that we have bottomed out every last detail of every allowance because this has been a tight job in a relatively short period as the information has come in.  We have sent the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform a further 42 business cases where we consider there is a good business rationale for the allowances and additionality such as the undertaking of arduous work and working unsocial hours.<\/p> <p>As things stand, they are with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration.  We provided the committee with the list yesterday.  I suspect the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been so busy on the allowance issue generally that we have not heard anything.  We await developments in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100017#Q02200","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351701000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>With regard to the consistency element, with 34 local authorities there is bound to be an absence of universal application of some of the allowances at least.  There will also be inconsistencies in how various allowances are dealt with by local authorities.  Is there a common pay scale across the 34 local authorities?  With regard to how allowances are applied, if a union negotiates an allowance for outdoor staff in Donegal County Council, is this used as a precedent to make a case for the same allowance to be paid in Cork, Kilkenny or Tipperary, or would it be a stand-alone allowance and unique to Donegal?  Does the Department ultimately sanction the pay, terms and conditions for local authority staff?  This has to do with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's definition of \"civil servant\" and the use of this model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100018#R00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351701000,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Local authorities do have common pay scales.  For ease of reference for local authorities, a circular dating from 2009 includes all of the pay scales from senior executive officer, just below the director of service level at grade 8, to specialist professionals, library staff, technicians, craft workers, general operatives and water caretakers.  There are standard scales for all of these pay grades in the local government system.<\/p><p>  Of the allowances agreed locally, we have not sent approximately 161.  However, we have sent 42 to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They tend to be agreed locally and can apply in more than one local authority.  If one examines them, one will see more than one local authority pays branch librarians to clean after hours, but the rates vary slightly in each local authority because they are agreed locally.  It is not necessarily the case that branch librarians throughout the country have stated a desire to receive this allowance and not all local authorities have decided it is the direction in which they want to move.  While certain allowances are picked up or agreed locally in one or more local authority, there has not been a drift, whereby this becomes the norm throughout all local authorities.  In a number of cases the pattern of allowances has tended to evolve from particular local circumstances.  To take a completely different example, if a problem arises with stray dogs in areas far from a dog pound, a number of local authorities will pay a small allowance to a caretaker or general operative to kennel the dogs overnight rather than having to travel a long distance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100018#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Tallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1351701000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>That would be cost-effective.

The Department has given information about kennel allowances but no information about fixed travel allowances for area engineers.  There must be more than 100 area engineers in Ireland and I am sure they receive a few thousand euro a year.  The area engineer who is not travelling is not much of an area engineer.  More substantial sums of money are paid through the allowances about which we have not heard, relative to the sums of money about which we have heard.<\/p><p>  I referred to a point that haunted the HSE and this committee a number of years ago.  In the health services, the HSE had a computerised payroll system called PPARS.  A fortune was spent on it and it was rolled out through a number of regions.  What bedevilled the system was that some 2,800 payment methods were used in the health services.  Rather than rationalise them, the HSE attempted to computerise the payment methods and it was a mess.  The HSE started with a mess, computerised the mess and ended with a computerised mess.  It should have tried to rationalise and streamline the payments and then computerise a simple system.  As part of shared services of public service reform, we are in the process of organisations bidding, through various local authorities, on a number of contracts such as waste management licences, the collection of fees, human resources, procurement and purchases.  I am worried about where this will end up.  The unfortunate successful local authority, which must centralise payroll for all local authorities, may get a shock upon seeing hundreds of different items that are under the radar that have not come to the committee's attention and have not come to light.  It might end up being a much larger problem.  This is similar to other areas in which we have tried to centralise systems, such as student grants and medical cards.  I am afraid we are heading down the same road when we do not have an exact fix on the matter.  Every allowance sent to the Department will end up on someone's payslip at the end of the fortnight and we must be exact on these types of arrangements.  The committee does not yet have a handle on the matter, with 160 allowances outstanding.  I have seen other Departments centralising matters and problems emerge.  The problem could arise if people do not know about the 160 allowances as it is not contained in the brief they see at the beginning.  I sound a note of caution.  I wish the Department success in its projects but some may be more complicated.  I look forward to receiving information on some of those allowances to which we referred in the list of 160 allowances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012103100020#T00900","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1351702200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Arising from the comments of Deputy Sean Fleming, the departmental officials and congress, I was taken by the fact that Mr. Cody and other representatives told us there was no consultation with unions and that the implementation body did not consult unions in local government and across the sector.  We seem to be heading down a road where management is examining the allowances and has received what it terms business cases, although I would not describe them as business cases.  I said to congress earlier that I was shocked it was not consulted in the provision of information for the business cases.  Congress might have had concerns about the payment of the allowance, the type of the allowance and how it was viewed in terms of core pay.  Congress might have had concerns about how the allowance was described.  Some of the allowances are very poorly described.  There was no consultation with unions.  The plan seems to be extended day-to-day.  There is no central plan and the Department seems to be working on it as it goes along.  We were told there were 1,100 allowances and now further allowances have emerged in the local government sector, which we did not consider.  The unions have still not been asked about this.  Ms King was quite clear that the issue of the allowances would be fought tooth and nail, with a view to keeping the allowances because they form part of core pay.  If the Department was setting out on the correct path, it should have established this in the first place so that we do not have a hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts, followed by engagement with unions that is now taking place, and all of it amounting to nothing.  The Department identified some allowances that had been agreed, tested in the Labour Court and acknowledged as part of core pay.  Nevertheless, some of these allowances are listed in the review.  Today, Ms Tallon tells us that in the case of 14 of the allowances, business cases were made to the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has instructed local government bodies to pay them.<\/p> <p>Is the plan to review these allowances not completely flawed on the side of the Department, because the other main player, the unions, was never consulted?

We did not consult the unions in advance of management taking the decision to look at part of the payroll because that is not the way we carry out our business.  In the same way, when we decided to look at the way we pay sick leave, we did not consult staff representatives in advance as to the appropriateness of doing so.  Instead, we said we would conduct our review and when the outcome of that review was complete, we would talk to them and discuss what it meant in terms of the people they represent.  In effect, the allowances review, at the instruction of the Minister, was conducted in the same way.  Public service management is making decisions about the way it would like to try to save money from the public service payroll.  It is advancing that process and at the appropriate time, it will talk to the staff side about the implications of the decisions taken in that regard.  I was a bit surprised that the Chairman expressed surprise about that.  We are doing our job in terms of taking proper management decisions about the sorts of things we are doing.

They have expressed the view that many of the allowances are actually core pay, and the unions themselves said they are core pay.

There were allowances for which, on review of the business case, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform considered that there was an adequate business case for their continued payment to new beneficiaries.  Of the 14 national allowances indicated by local government, a number of those have been approved for payment to new beneficiaries.  In other words, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, having reviewed the business case made by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, considers there is an adequate business case for their continued payment to new beneficiaries.  There are two other groups of allowances - those we considered did not have a business case for payment to new beneficiaries, and those we considered should be reviewed in their terms of payment to both serving and new beneficiaries.  Those are the communications that have come out of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to all sectors.  There is a much smaller group of allowances on which we have suspended a decision or need more information.  There are only a small number of allowances in that field.<\/p><p>  All I can say is that we have taken an approach here which is that management has to take decisions around what it will do and then, and only then, engage with staff representatives.  We have consistently said that engagement will take place.  We communicated formally with the public service committee of ICTU in December when we commenced the allowances review.  We communicated formally with it on the outcome of the review.  Our intention is that there be local engagement through the proper industrial relations forum, as is appropriate in this sort of scenario.  This is what any employer does.  He or she looks at the cost base and then decides whether there is a need to approach union representatives or staff on what he or she is going to do.  That is the approach that is being adopted in this case.  It is pretty standard and is exactly as we have done in a number of other areas in which we decided to examine and change the terms and conditions of employment of public servants.

Nobody has a veto over the process.  What public sector managers are doing and are being instructed to do is actually managing.  There is a mechanism in place for adjudications and rulings to be made on decisions by managers after negotiations have taken place.  I actually welcome the fact that the paralysis that has dominated the public sector and stood in the way of public sector reform in the past few years is being broken.<\/p><p>  Having said that, from our engagement with the unions, which the Chairman touched on, the criticism I have of the process is that the Labour Court has made a determination on some of these allowances.  I hope we are not going down the route of putting forward potential savings that we will not be able to achieve.  I do not know if Ms Buckley is in a position to comment on that - I know she probably does not want to comment on specific allowances.  <\/p><p>  While I welcome the process, I do not think any employer, and certainly no private sector employer, would wait for an employee to want to see a change to his or her pay structure.  That is not how the world works.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

The last time we were before the committee was on 15 September last year and at that stage we went through in some depth what the bank had been doing since nationalisation.  Today, I would like to update the committee further on the progress the bank has made since September 2011 and on some of the challenges we face.  Following my presentation, my colleagues and I will be happy to deal with any issues members of the committee want to raise.<\/p><p>  As committee members know, the bank's mission is to deal with the assets of the former Anglo Irish Bank and those of Irish Nationwide Building Society since the merger of these two entities in July 2011.  We now do this under the name, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and have been doing so for just over a year in a concerted and directed effort to minimise the overall cost and maximise the returns in the interest of the taxpayer.  We operate on the basis of an approved restructuring plan which was submitted to the European Commission in January 2011 and which it is intended will bring about an orderly wind-down of the entity over a period of ten years up to approximately 2020.  An additional objective since the merger of the two entities is to prepare the former INBS mortgage book for sale within a period of five years.<\/p><p>  The IBRC is a regulated entity that is closely supervised by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank of Ireland.  In addition, it is supervised by a monitoring trustee which has been put in place to report to the European Commission on the bank's adherence to the terms of the commitment letter which accompanied the Commission's approval of the restructuring plan.  The bank is subject to all of the relevant provisions of company law and also to a series of codes of practice relevant to State-owned entities and companies as well as to the provisions under which the original new entity was set up by an Act of the Oireachtas post-nationalisation.  It operates in the context of overall banking policy as laid down by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government.<\/p><p>  I reported last year that the board and management of the bank had effected considerable and dramatic change in creating a fit for purpose wind-down vehicle to deliver on its mandate and resolution objectives.  The most significant of these since then has been the sale of the bank's US loan book, which was effected in October 2011 and saw a once-off balance sheet reduction of close to $10 billion in one of the largest ever single sale transactions seen in the US real estate market.  This operation was successfully carried out without any negative effect on the bank's regulatory capital base.  Following the completion of the operation, there remained a balance of approximately $1 billion of unsold assets, which fell out of the sale for a number of technical reasons.  We have made substantial progress on the disposal of these assets since completion of the original sale, and all offices of the bank in the United States have been closed.<\/p><p>  Further progress in planned and controlled downsizing of the bank has been made since.  We have prepared a series of notes for the committee which show there has been a further reduction in our balance sheet, bringing the total reduction, excluding the promissory notes and bonds, to 78% since nationalisation.  Deleveraging will continue, principally on a loan-by-loan basis, but with consideration being given, based on informed analysis, to portfolio or book sales in both of the banks' remaining jurisdictions, the UK and Ireland, where it makes economic sense.  Deleveraging to date has been substantially ahead of the targets set in the restructuring plan and we hope to maintain that accelerated performance.  I should add that our success in this endeavour will depend crucially on developments in property markets and the condition and liquidity of markets in both Ireland and the UK.  Dealing with the most distressed parts of the bank's loan portfolio will be especially challenging.<\/p><p>  We place a close focus on cost containment and reduction within the merged entity.  Staffing is one of the main cost components.  We have now reduced the number of employees in the bank by over 50%, from the peak staffing levels of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society combined in 2008, which was approximately 2,250.  By the end of this year, core staffing levels in IBRC, excluding the NAMA unit, will be below 800.<\/p> <p>I take this opportunity to express, once again, my appreciation of the way in which bank staff have responded to the demands inherent in the restructuring process since nationalisation.  It has been a very demanding process of constant change accompanied by a great deal of negative comment about their workplace.  Staff have participated in a radical process of change and retraining.  Without their active participation, the progress we have made in the face of considerable difficulties simply would not have been possible.  While we are obliged to review staff numbers, we must also ensure the quality and skill levels of our staff match up to the extremely exacting demands of the market situation and the wind-down role of the bank.  As I said, the staff response to those demands has been exemplary.<\/p><p> We have streamlined the operation of the merged entity with office closures and sales of premises.  A process to evaluate the outsourcing of some support functions was initiated, and several functions have been outsourced.  We have, <i>inter alia,<\/i>completed a significant exercise in the area of legal expenses attributable to ongoing litigation matters and in the area of the appointment of receivers.  These are two necessary ongoing expenditures and we have taken steps to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that we obtain value for money out of that expenditure.  These and other measures reflect the bank's continuing commitment to ensuring its infrastructure and business processes are efficient and appropriate for the changing size of the organisation as we progress through the phases of the wind-down.<\/p><p> We have continued to strengthen the board of the bank.  It consists of ten members, including the chief executive officer.  One member was appointed in November 2008, one in February 2009, the CEO in September 2009, three directors in May 2010, two in 2011 and two this year.  Fees for non-executive directors were initially reduced by 20% at the end of 2008 and by a further 15% with effect from 1 July this year.<\/p><p> The total balance sheet of IBRC has reduced from &euro;101 billion at the time of nationalisation to approximately &euro;53 billion today.  This includes the &euro;29.3 billion in support from the Government to the former Anglo Irish Bank and the &euro;5.4 billion put into the former Irish Nationwide Building Society.  IBRC is totally reliant on funding from the Central Bank and monetary authorities and from the Government.  Funding from the Central Bank and monetary authorities stands at approximately &euro;42 billion.  If we exclude the Government's promissory notes, total assets are approximately &euro;25 billion.  Impaired loans on our books amount to almost &euro;18 billion, with cumulative impairment provisions of almost &euro;11 billion.  Impaired loans now account for approximately 66% of our total loan balances.<br \/>We remain reasonably hopeful that the final cost of the operation will be closer to &euro;25 billion rather than the &euro;29 million to &euro;34 billion estimated in September 2010.  This is, of course, highly contingent on what happens to property markets here and in the United Kingdom.  The outcome will depend on what happens in the general economy and may also be impacted by any restructuring of the promissory note.  In addition, the banking situation is very vulnerable to what happens in the eurozone in general.  Notwithstanding these qualifications, which are substantial, we are confident that we have reduced the expected final cost of the operation to the taxpayer by an appreciable amount.<\/p><p> The bank has made significant progress since nationalisation in spite of considerable and complex challenges.  The task ahead is possibly equally challenging and the problems are different in many respects.  Following the merger with the Irish Nationwide Building Society, we are managing a relatively small portfolio of residential and investment mortgages.  We recognise that the situation for mortgage holders is very difficult in the current economic environment and that this is unlikely to change for the better in the short term.  We noted with interest the recent comments on this matter by Ms Fiona Muldoon of the Central Bank.  We agree that banks must be decisive and creative in dealing with the system-wide issue and with the stress being experienced by many ordinary borrowers.  We acquired what I can only describe as a very challenging mortgage book in July 2011, as can be seen in the notes we have prepared for the committee.  A significant amount of work has been undertaken in regard to this book as part of our mortgage arrears resolution strategy.  The strategy is designed to deliver a range of forbearance solutions to support borrowers in financial distress or those likely to fall into arrears in the near future.  We are tackling these issues and making progress.  It is a complex matter and it takes times to construct solutions that work.  We will roll out those solutions in accordance with the timelines agreed with the Financial Regulator.  The real test is not simply in the launching of new products but in ensuring thereafter that the solutions work and have the intended effects.  IBRC is considering the possibility of doing even more, where practical and possible, with some of the more difficult cases in our mortgage book.<\/p><p> Another notable challenge for the bank is staffing, to which I have referred.  Ongoing restructuring as the bank is wound down brings constant uncertainty for all staff.  No long-term future career can be offered to those we seek to attract or those who wish to stay.  This creates difficulties in terms of retention and motivation of staff.  We are losing skilled and experienced personnel to other institutions at an unacceptable rate.  Those individuals must be replaced with high quality candidates who can do the job we require them to do.  Some 25% of IBRC employees are on short, fixed-term contract, the number is increasing.  A drain in corporate knowledge is a serious side-effect of this dynamic.  Of the original 2,250 Anglo Irish Bank and INBS staff at the time of the bank guarantee, fewer than 575 remain working in the merged entity.  This underlines further the dramatic change that has taken place in the workplace culture.  The numerous comments to the effect that the bank does not need the number of staff currently employed simply are ill-informed.  The challenge for management is to ensure we have the right number of qualified staff to complete our task, no more and no less.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that the objectives of the board and management team are to run the bank in the public interest in a manner which minimises costs, maximises the return to the Irish State and treats customers and creditors fairly in the context of policy as laid down by the Government.  The work being undertaken at IBRC is critical to the economy.  The work of an asset recovery bank is complex and not easily understood by the public.  In particular, the nature of the management and staffing expertise required for the task is often insufficiently understood.<\/p><p> There is clearly a high degree of interest in what we do and say.  Since our discussion with the committee last year, there have been, at the last count, 7,362 print articles on the bank's activities and a huge number of media queries.  We feel very privileged to be the subject of so many parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il.  We deal with those queries and questions in house.  I acknowledge the need for the bank to engage in an open, honest and transparent manner with all of its stakeholder groups and to communicate clearly what it is doing.<\/p> <p>In addition to fulfilling our statutory reporting obligations, we regularly communicate progress achieved and major milestones along the way to ensure what we are doing is understood by stakeholders, including the media and the public.<\/p><p> I also should add in parentheses that if the joint committee has some additional time available at the end of the session, I might go into detail on the number of statutory reporting requirements we must meet.  It regularly keeps me awake late at night, shortly before our board meetings, to check that we have made all the statutory returns we must make.  I sometimes am tempted to wonder, in the small hours of the morning, who reads the goddamned things when they get to the other side, but that is another day's work.<\/p><p> I wish to make three points of clarification in this connection before I conclude.  The first relates to the bank's dealings with high profile borrowers, in which there frequently is a substantial amount of outside interest.  We have strict legal and ethical obligations not to disclose the bank's dealings or relationships with individual borrowers in the public domain.  We simply cannot discuss the specifics of any individual case with any third party.  Following a call in the media from a member of this joint committee for these dealings to be investigated, the chief executive officer, Mr. Aynsley, has given the Chair a commitment to the effect that the bank is more than willing to discuss in detail its approach to managing both performing and non-performing borrowers and the multifaceted governance that applies to all decisions in this regard without exception.  I repeat and fully endorse that commitment.  I can state categorically that any debt restructuring decisions the bank has made have been in accordance with that governance process and in the best interests of the taxpayer at all times.<\/p><p> The second point of clarification concerns the bank's appointment of and the mandate given to advisers.  The bank is in wind-down mode and the process will be pursued by selling, as I indicated, entire loan books, portfolios of loans or individual loans.  It is, therefore, a matter of when and not if we so do, as we achieve full resolution under the Government and European Union mandates.  Details regarding the individual appointments of advisers relating to any commercially sensitive areas of activity, such as the ongoing analysis or the sale or recovery of individual loans or loan portfolios, must be treated as commercially sensitive information, given the real risk that public disclosure might have a detrimental effect on the bank's efforts to maximise loan recoveries.  Therefore we will disclose any specific information in this regard.  In response to continuing interest in the matter on the part of particular members of the joint committee, I can assure them that the bank adheres to a structured procurement process for the appointment of all of its advisers.  That process is open, objective and transparent and is subject to the bank's governance processes, including both the provisions of the relationship framework with the Minister for Finance and oversight, through a regular reporting process, through the board of the bank.<\/p><p> The third point of clarification relates to the bank's recovery of debts owed by the Quinn family.  I am sure members will appreciate these actions are the subject of litigation and are a matter for the courts that will be before the courts again as early as tomorrow.  We will not be able to respond to questions today on any matters related to that activity.<\/p><p> I can again assure the joint committee that all of the actions and decisions undertaken by the bank are, without exception, focused on maximising returns in the best interests of the taxpayer and we now are quite ready to deal with any issues the committee may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351678800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dukes.  I have a few items to deal with before we get things under way.  Is it agreed that the opening statements made this morning will be published?  Agreed.  As this part of the meeting will conclude at 1 p.m., I must ensure that I will accommodate all speakers who present themselves.  I propose that the first round of speakers from both the Government and Opposition sides be limited to 15 minutes and, depending on how time is being managed after that, I will readjust times, if necessary, to accommodate everyone.<\/p><p>  Before calling on the first speakers, I wish to put in context what we intend to do this morning.  The two other banks the joint committee will meet today and tomorrow, namely, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will make presentations on how they intend to trade their way out of their current difficulties and get themselves operating independently from the State.  The mission of Mr. Dukes's organisation is quite different, as it is about winding down this bank over the next ten years in a sustainable and orderly fashion and in such a manner that the minimum cost is accrued to the taxpayer.  That is a summary of the presentation Mr. Dukes has given.  In so doing, I seek a point of clarification in respect of Mr. Dukes's position in the bank.  Is it as a public interest director or is there a public interest director on the board of Anglo Irish Bank, as there is on the boards of Bank of Ireland and AIB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100005#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351678800,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Before answering that question, may I add one brief remark, which was implicit in what I stated in the opening statement?  The context of the bank's activity, as the Chairman observed, is to wind down the operation by 2020, including the preparation of the ex-Irish Nationwide Building Society loan book for sale, if possible, in five years.  While that was implicit in what I stated, I should make it explicit.  Moreover, one of our concerns is to maintain the capital base of the bank.  It is part of the complex of decision making that we maintain the capital base in the interests of the shareholder.<\/p><p>  On the matter of public interest directors, it is true that I was first appointed to the board of the bank in November 2008 as one of two public interest directors under the action that was taken by the Government at that time.  The bank was nationalised subsequently and is now the property of the State, the Minister for Finance being the shareholder.  I am unsure of the ceremonials of the issue but I would consider each director of the bank to be a public interest director at present.  Our mandate is clearly to act in the interests of the shareholder, who I take to be a proxy for the public interest.  The Government is obliged to act in the public interest and, consequently, I take the view that all our actions in the bank are to be seen in the context of pursuing the public interest, as it is defined for us by the regulations and policy framework laid down by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dukes"},{"type":"speech","time":1351678800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>In that context, the witnesses might provide the joint committee with a broader explanation or understanding as to how the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, operates at present.

Two independent rent reviews have said that the rent would be half of what it is at present if market rent were applied.  In fact, the situation is so ludicrous that it would be cheaper for the company to close down, pay the IBRC rent and lay off 50 employees.

However, given the Minister's instruction to NAMA last year with regard to upward-only rent reviews, why does the IBRC not seem to be proactively dealing with this?  The information I have to hand is that the IBRC is chasing landlords based outside the State with whom it has agreements, while the companies concerned are losing money hand over fist.

Perhaps this was put into the public domain to embarrass Mr. Aynsley.  However, it does raise certain questions as to whether it is common practice for the IBRC to liaise with its largest debtors.  Was this an isolated case or is it common practice, as opposed to issuing an electronic memorandum?  I am asking this question because we want to be reassured that what is left of the former Anglo Irish Bank and INBS has moved away entirely from the culture that prevailed in the past in which there were close relationships between those running the banks and their largest borrowers.  Mr. Aynsley is involved in making commercial decisions involving hundreds of millions of euro.  One can go through all of the governance process to which Mr. Dukes referred, but ultimately it does come down to judgment calls.  It is not my job to say whether these are correct.

When we came out of those meetings, my colleague Mr. Richard Woodhouse was given the authority to contact the Barclay brothers to inform them of the decision.  I attempted to call Mr. McKillen but, of course, could not get hold of him.  He does not do e-mail so I sent him a text.  It was as simple as that.  The reminder to him, following it up, was simply that this was a board decision and that it was a bank-client relationship that should not be divulged, as we were aware at the time that he was in litigation with the Barclay brothers.  It was inappropriate, we felt, that he went to the press with that.  Of course, it ultimately came out during the discovery process in that litigation.  That is all there was to it.<\/p><p>  It is very important that the Deputy is confident that this bank is operating in a different way from the old management of the bank before nationalisation.  The key point is that there is no one individual in the organisation who has the capacity to influence or make decisions on any of these loans.  We have a very well-structured governance process.  It starts off with an account management team that is responsible for analysis, monitoring and oversight of the relationship every day to ensure the organisation has all the information that is required.  That in turn is overseen by a client relationship manager for each one of these accounts.  In the case of Mr. McKillen, Mr. Woodhouse is operating as his client relationship manager.  We have a series of asset quality forums that examine these accounts on an ongoing basis, assessing the appropriateness of the various impairment levels or the performing loan portfolio, although it is a small one given what has happened to the bank.  Decisions are processed up through a group credit committee that has representatives from the business, independent and risk management oversight units of the bank.  There are two main operating committees in the bank - the transaction review committee and the investment product committee - which deal with the sale or holding of loans, equity participation or investment or divestment decisions, wealth management business and the protection of investor interests.  These committees have various delegations that come down through the board.  There are multiple people within the organisation that scrutinise every aspect of the loan decisions.  For loans above certain levels, as in the case in question, there is a requirement to take these facilities in detail to the board to seek main board approval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Aynsley"},{"type":"speech","time":1351680000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>One departure from the practices of the past in the institutions Mr. Aynsley inherited is how hospitality is dealt with.

To put it crudely, we could sell the whole lot tomorrow if we did not have to worry about the price.  If we were to do that - this is an unscientific way of saying it - and if we stated that we are not worried about the price and total return and we are prepared to burn all the capital, we could probably sell the whole lot tomorrow, and that would not be a good outcome for the State.<\/p><p>  Deputy McGrath mentioned judgment calls.  We must make judgment calls at the end of the day.  The sale of the United States loan book last year was a very successful enterprise.  It would not be possible in the market circumstances today to get anything like as good a result for that loan book.  It may happen that next year market conditions in the United States might be such that somebody could come along and say to us that if we had held off our 2011 sale of the American loan book until 2013 or 2014 we would have done much better out of it - they might well be right - but we must make a judgment call at a point in time.  In answer to the question as to whether we would accelerate it if possible, the answer is \"Yes\", if we could do it happy in the knowledge that we were maximising returns and that we were not burning capital.<\/p><p>  The same applies to Deputy Timmins' question about the INBS mortgage book.

On tracking title and ensuring the solidity of title, in both the former Anglo Irish Bank loan book, which we took over on nationalisation, and the INBS loan book, we have had to do a very considerable amount of work to ensure that we can be confident that we have good title and a good base on which to deal with them.  There is ongoing work on that and the committee will be aware that a considerable amount of work had to be done in that regard in the transfer of chunks of the loan books to NAMA also.  I am not sure we will ever be at the point where we can state with full confidence that every \"i\" is dotted and every \"t\" crossed, but we have put a considerable amount of effort into ensuring that the condition of the book is as good as we can make it so that we can make progress on the sales.  It is probably fair to say that in none of the asset disposals in which we have been engaged so far have we met any substantial problem in that regard because the books have been properly prepared for the sales.  The great majority of that work is done in-house.<\/p><p>  On legal fees we said that there is a big volume of legal work that will need to be done on behalf of the bank and we invited a wide diversity of firms from across the country to make offers to us for the terms on which they would carry out this work.  Our objective was to get the work done as cheaply as possible but ensuring that we got the quality of work that we required.  We have broadened the field out considerably past the large firms in the business.  Personally, I take the view that there are probably a good many legal practitioners all around the country who, if given the right opportunity, could be as big and as successful as any of the big four or five, and if they can do it in doing good value work for us, I would be happy with that as long as we get a good bang for our buck out of it.  We have paid particular attention to legal practitioners and receivers in seeking to get value for money on that.<\/p><p>  Our legal department is competently staffed.  We could do with more staff.

Sometimes we put too much emphasis on something that was not policed and then we over police.  Are there some measures the Government might take, or perhaps not take, that might include IBRC in its commercial remit?  Perhaps there are some shackles on IBRC that it could do without and it would be of more benefit ultimately to the organisation and the taxpayer if there was a little less regulation, if I may use that term.  What statutory returns could be dropped?<\/p> <p> With regard to deleveraging, who is actually buying the properties?  What is the profile of the companies involved?  I understand many American companies and pension funds are buying properties here.  Who are they and what kinds of properties are they seeking?  Is it fair to say that as we go along it will be more difficult to sell because the prime properties are the ones that will be sold first?  If IBRC manages to wind down within ten years - perhaps in eight or nine years - what will happen to the residual properties and loan books?  How will they be integrated?

In the US, funds are being raised on a pan-European basis and an allocation of that European-wide fund is allocated to Ireland.

What is the moral justification for crucifying our taxpayers with destructive austerity to bail out speculators?<\/p><p>  Let me protest in passing.  When many people are suffering so much, that any bank, be it private or public, is paying hundreds of thousands of euro, much less &euro;500,000 or millions, to top executives is obscene.<\/p><p>  Ordinary people, including me, can be bamboozled by discussions on promissory notes and the merry-go-round of bonds, notes, etc.  If &euro;3.1 billion must be paid each March, and setting aside the various manoeuvrings in that regard, what are the mechanics of it and how will it be paid?  In a few sentences, will Mr. Dukes reprise the story of the &euro;31 billion that constitutes the promissory notes?  Where did it come from and where has it gone in recent years?  If the State asserted that the amount was a burden too far on the people and that it would stop further payments, what would the consequences be apart from apoplexy in the EU establishment and among the sharks in the financial markets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100012#L01100","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351683000,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I am not being smart, but the Deputy has asked questions about the promissory note and the payment of &euro;3.1 billion in March.

Is there some connection with other banks when trying to push for a resolution to this?

The first product roll-outs will take place in December.  As Mr. Dukes said, products such as the split mortgage product will give relief.  In response to what was said about the provision numbers going up, I would like to refer to what will happen if we accelerate the process without a process of debt forgiveness.  I know much of this will come back to views on debt forgiveness.  At the moment, the bank does not have any debt forgiveness capacity.  The Senator asked whether we write down loans for customers.  We have a policy of not writing down loans for customers.  We will take write-offs when we sell a loan to another party.  A number of loans have been auctioned through a process.  Their value is driven by that public process.  It depends on what people are prepared to pay for the asset or loan at that particular time.<\/p><p>  We do not write that off when selling a loan facility.  We do not go through that process with the residential part of the portfolio.  It is very much a measured process of working out a consensual solution with the borrower, where we can, as long as the borrower co-operates.  As we bring this series of products on line through the MARS process, we hope to address many of the difficulties people are having.  Products like the spilt mortgage product, which will give people the capacity to resize the amount of money they spend on a mortgage and park the other part of the resized mortgage, will help people to manage their cashflows as they go through the recovery.  Unfortunately, we do not have any mortgage forgiveness or debt forgiveness products that we can offer.<\/p><p>  As we said earlier, we are going to look at the very distressed end of our book.  We hope to be able to develop a different series of products around that intensive care unit.  We have to go through that process.  It is difficult because we have inherited what is probably the worst residential book, with the worst system constraints, in the Irish marketplace.  We have had to reconstruct much of what one would normally hope to find when one takes over one of these books.

We are different from the other banks for several reasons but our strategy remains the same.  We are different because the bank tended to lend all of the money; if it liked a transaction it would do 100%.  When looking at Bank of Ireland or AIB's portfolio, there are more syndicated loans and other players.  Often we would also provide mezzanine finance.  The bank's concentration in each investment is much higher.  The fact the assets drive home at night gives rise to enormous risk in realising the best long-term economic value for the shareholder.  As a consequence, the preferred platform is a consensual restructuring wherever we can get that done.  Going through the courts and other recovery mechanisms is extremely costly and a consensual outcome is by far the best, and dealing sensitively with the employees and the management of the company is how we stimulate the best possible bid from a third party buyer.<\/p><p>  Coming back to Deputy Higgins's earlier question, albeit phrased differently for residential mortgages, many of these companies on our books were financed and constructed at the height of the boom and the level of debt in those companies is unsustainably high.  Part of the creativity we want to bring to bear is the \"right-sizing\" of that debt, not writing it off, to make the company of capable of sustaining a portion of the debt and packaging the company in a manner that will allow a buyer to realise precisely what he is buying, having certainty about staff and debt levels and an appreciation of the forward look of the company.  We utilise experts, often accountancy firms which help us with an independent business review on a particular product, and the solutions are, therefore, both bespoke and discreet.  The collusion that was asked about earlier does not arise.  We must be nimble and sympathetic to each case and operate within those parameters to achieve the best price on sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Woodhouse"},{"type":"speech","time":1351685400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I asked because the taxpayer who is going home with &euro;14,000 is looking at this and the buck stops with him for those loans.

I thank the witnesses for coming in.<\/p><p>  The story of how Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society merged to become the IBRC is amazing.<\/p> <p>In 2006, in Davos, the world's richest, most powerful and so-called most intelligent people lauded Anglo Irish Bank as the best banking model in the world, with a balance sheet of approximately &euro;100 billion, as shown in these excellent bar graphs which I find very helpful for seeing at a glance what has happened on the balance sheet from then to now.  The bank had &euro;100 billion of assets and was lauded as the best bank in the world.  Now, under Mr. Dukes's chairmanship and executive management, this has been shrunk to just over &euro;50 billion, which includes a large chunk of the remaining &euro;28 billion of promissory notes, the asset that was created to allow the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, to be advanced to redeem the losses of the investors or bondholders.  As Deputy Higgins pointed out, he was one of the first on the European stage to put the case to Mr. Barroso that it was wrong for Irish citizens to be saddled with investor losses.<\/p><p> The &euro;31 billion of promissory notes, now reduced to &euro;28 billion, has a headline rate of interest that is the income for IBRC.  According to Karl Whelan, over the period of the promissory notes, that will amount to approximately &euro;18 billion.  Therefore, that &euro;18 billion in projected income is offset against the estimate of losses to the end of IBRC's life.  If we take even half of that &euro;18 billion and add it to the &euro;25 billion - the estimate of losses that will be found buried in the Anglo experience - that will amount to &euro;34 billion as the losses that originated out of Anglo.  That brings us to the stage now where the funding has changed and the citizens of Ireland are administering a drip to inject money to redeem the losses of the replacing creditor, the euro system and the Central Bank of Ireland, who gave the investors the get-out-of-jail-free card.  This is not pleasant.<\/p><p> This brings me back to a question for the IBRC.  Is it not logical, financially and arithmetically, that it should be possible to negotiate on this?  It should be possible to make the case to Europe that we plugged the hole in the framework, stopped it falling to the ground and, therefore, deserve some reduction in the bill that is being laid totally on the backs of the Irish people.  We deserve that on the basis that the arithmetic can do it.  This is not a financially complex process that will take 40 or 30 years.  It simply requires the creditor - the Central Bank - to agree to buy in and not seek-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100016#P01600","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351686000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>The Deputy has three minutes remaining.

Is NAMA involved and does it take the advice of the more senior people acting in that capacity on how to proceed with the number of receivers who have been appointed?  I have in mind a case I believe is pretty hopeless.  It seems as though NAMA is playing along - perhaps there are big salaries going to some of these people - but I see no prospect of a return at all.

Yes, we are required to maintain a minimum capital level of 8%.  We are capitalised for some degree of stress, given the state of the markets and given our mandate to sell down the portfolio.  Our strategy is to stay within that regulatory capital threshold as we wind down.  On the question as to whether we can close this earlier, yes we can.  The way we look at it, this is a very black and white situation.  Yes, we can but there is a capital consequence.  We are into what we refer to as the \"hard yards\" part of the portfolio, that is, individual line-by-line work-out.  That is in the absence of markets opening up and offering us an opportunity such as we saw in the United States.  That was a strategy we began in October 2010 and which was concluded in October 2011.  An enormous amount of work was completed to get the book in shape in order that we knew exactly what we had and we could take individual loans or parts of that portfolio to market.  As the market opened up and the commercial mortgage-backed securities, CMBS, markets reopened, we had the opportunity to market the entire portfolio and of course all of it went, bar roughly &euro;1 billion, which now has been worked down to approximately &euro;400 million.  If markets offer opportunity, our strategy is, in the meantime, to continue through this process of preparation and maintenance of data tapes, etc., in order that as markets operate and open up, we can put portfolios or more individual loans into the marketplace and close it earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100019#S03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Aynsley"},{"type":"speech","time":1351687200,"counter":757,"content":"<p>With a fair wind, how early could IBRC wind down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100019#S03200","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351687200,"counter":758,"content":"<p>To give the Deputy an idea, it always is difficult.

It has been said before that AIB does recognise the historical role it has played in where we have come to today, and the issues we face.  We want to remind everybody that we are fully aware of, and do apologise on behalf of AIB for, our contribution to this situation.  Notwithstanding that, the team here today is brand new.  I will speak more about that shortly.<\/p><p>  The efforts which we have to make to change AIB are very broad.  The team here today is a brand new one.  Our entire leadership team is new to the bank and brings a wide variety of skills to the table.  The team is passionate about restoring AIB to a position where we can support the economy, return some value to the shareholder, and at the same time address what is a very important population - those who are in significant distress, whether they are customers in homes or SMEs.   <\/p><p>  The scale of what we have to do in the bank is fairly dramatic.  For the purposes of history, the peak of our head count was 27,000 in 2007.  Following the severance programme for the bank today we will be at 12,000.  That is still subject to further potential reduction. <\/p><p>  Our balance sheet over the period has been reduced by 26%.<\/p> <p>There is a material change in the overall structure of the bank.  We have changed the leadership team, reduced the workforce, cut pay for the majority of the workforce and reorganised the structure of the bank to be more simplified and focused on customers.  We are trying to rebuild the business at the same time as restructuring while addressing customers in financial distress, which requires the build-out of a new bank capability.  On top of that we have the overall regulatory regime, which has escalated significantly as it catches up on areas that needed to be enhanced over time.  This all has to be done at the same time as motivating staff who have had a difficult time over the past four years, the majority of whom have not had an influence in the difficult decisions that have been made and their consequences.  They do pay a price and it is difficult for them to remain motivated.  It is also difficult for us to get them motivated to deliver some of the solutions required.  These changes, given their scale and complexity, will take time.  Everyone would like to solve everything immediately but it does take time.<\/p><p> When I joined the bank ten months ago, there were several concerns about the bank&rsquo;s culture and the lack of trust between the bank and its key stakeholders, including the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  Our risk processes were very deficient and the customer model was broken.  Our ability to help people in financial distress was fairly non-existent.  We have introduced several cost-cutting measures.  A voluntary severance scheme is under way with 1,700 staff expected to depart by the end of December 2012 and a minimum target of 2,500 by 2014.  It is interesting to note that more than 2,500 applied for the scheme.  That speaks of the stress and the environment in which many of our staff work.  Annual savings in excess of &euro;200 million are expected from this scheme.  Pay and benefits have been tackled, with a 15% pay cut at executive levels while there is a pay freeze at more junior levels.  All employees who are members of a defined benefit pension scheme will be moved to a defined contribution pension scheme, which is expected to generate &euro;30 million in savings.  Several branch closures have taken place, which is a difficult decision.  We know it affects customers.  However, with our arrangements with An Post we are hoping to mitigate the loss of service in some locations.  We have to tackle fees.  In our variable expenditure, we estimate that we will have reduced the ongoing burden of professional fees by 60% this year.<\/p><p> We are also looking at how we run the bank.  We have a revised strategy based on servicing customers and increasing our effectiveness in lending in the economy - both mortgage lending and lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  AIB recognised that the leadership team needed to change, which was part of the culture change in the bank.  The entire board and leadership team has been replaced.  In the past 12 months AIB has appointed a new chief executive officer, chief risk officer, chief operating officer, head of audit, head of human resources, general counsel and head of corporate affairs.  Five new board members have also been appointed.  Of the 11 board members, two are public interest directors and the other nine were appointed in 2010 and 2011.  Of the 50 significant officers who were in place during the crisis, only two remain and only as non-executives.  We have created a financial solutions group, a dedicated unit of more than 2,000 people, to address debt and debt restructuring.<\/p><p> What is the bank doing about lending?  We are focusing on mortgages, SMEs and customers in difficulty while at the same time maintaining the bank&rsquo;s capital and remaining stable for the long-term health of the economy.  We have had to revise our processes to make it easier to access credit.  AIB is 28% ahead of its September year-to-date lending target of the Government&rsquo;s target of &euro;3.5 billion.  We continue to approve 90% of formal applications for credit.  We have tackled the overall big drive for the small business area and shown how we are open for business.  We are assisting SMEs and providing education, training and consultancy in moving them from collateral-based lending to cashflow lending.  Some SMEs are fearful about the economy and unwilling to take risks.  We are helping them understand how they can access credit.  In many cases, we have discovered that firms do not want more debt and would prefer equity.  There is a combination of issues in the dynamics of the economy which we are trying to address.  We have landed several funds to promote debt and equity.<\/p><p> AIB will comfortably exceed its internal target of &euro;1 billion in mortgage approvals for 2012.  There has been an improvement in the trend of mortgage lending.  However, as the Central Statistics Office pointed out recently, 46% of house purchases have been cash-only.  The number of total approvals has increased by 72%, and 47% of all mortgages sanctioned are by AIB.  This is quite a material share of the economy.  At the same time, however, we have also opened up EBS as a mortgage channel which was not in the market until two months ago.  We expect the EBS brand, a historically strong lender, and the AIB brand to be operating in the mortgage market fully in the next month.<\/p><p> AIB is participating in the NAMA 80:20 deferred consideration pilot initiative.  We have introduced new initiatives such as the negative equity trade-up mortgage and expanded our distribution arrangements with An Post.  Credit approvals have a quick turnaround and there will be a choice of brands with AIB and EBS.<\/p> <p>Our endeavours show that we are approving much more than we used to and a much higher volume.<\/p><p> We have had to try to address the overall deposit costs for the bank.  As we have explained at other meetings, the cost of funds to AIB is significant and leads to many of our products being loss-making.  Many of the mortgages we write, even at current rates, when one takes into account the cost of funding and administering the bank, still remain loss-making.  We have seen a big increase in deposits in the first half of the year.  We have even seen some unguaranteed corporate deposits come back to the bank, which is a positive trend and a signal of more stability and confidence in the banking system.<\/p><p> The stabilisation and support of customers in difficulty are probably the most complex and significant matters in the endeavours we must undertake.  We provided a complex analysis of this in the packs we sent to the committee.  In the past year we have had to build the skills set which was not really available in the bank previously and that skills set is for 2,000 staff.  We have had to identify existing and new outside resources.  We have had to create a separate division of financial solutions group.  We have had to train all of these individuals and work with them to help them on issues of how to manage, understand and be empathetic in the restructuring of debt with an individual.  We have developed all of the Keane report and MARS arrears products and have had these submitted to and approved by the regulators.  We have received full board approval for the entire strategy for addressing absolute debt levels in the marketplace and the use of each of these products.  The strategy has been documented and confirmed and communicated to the regulators.<\/p><p> At the same time, we have not been sitting there waiting for that approval.  We have been engaged with our customers and in many cases there has been initial forbearance.  If we look at principal homes, the private homes category, we have been addressing 33,000 customers in difficulties.  Although 85% to 90% of our customers are paying their mortgages, for those in distress for whom there is interest-only forbearance, 70% have been able to return to a normal payment schedule.  The balance we must address within more complex scenarios and in that regard, we come across in a significant number of cases somebody who has a home but also an SME, is in a partnership for buy-to-let properties and may have other family relations who, together, have invested in commercial real estate or other properties.  We are trying to address the disentangling of all of these components of debt by prioritising the issues of people staying in their homes and the stability of jobs and growth in SMEs.  Some 41% of the population of SMEs at which we have been looking are in advanced stages of restructuring.  Some 14% have debt restructuring.  If one looks at all of the SMEs on which we are working and which are in distress, our objective is to have 100% of them addressed by the second quarter of next year.  The speed at which we can move is significantly enhanced by having a trained and capable group of 2,000 staff.  We now have the resources and would like to receive all of the committee's questions on this topic, among others, that will allow us, together with the tools we have developed, to address the issue of sustainable debt in all categories of the economy.  <\/p><p> I want to bring my comments to a close because we have provided so much information that the guidance I am receiving is that we would like to move to questions as quickly as possible.  Let me reiterate the fact that we appreciate the support we have received, for which we are very thankful.  We recognise that AIB would not exist today were it not for that support.  At the same time, we must deliver a sustainable and profitable bank if we are to be able to lend and return shareholder value at the end of this process and support with capital those in distress.  We must be able on a long-term basis to support the growth of the economy.  As the economy will eventually return to strong growth, we need to have the ability in skill sets and the capability in terms of capital to support that growth.  We now have the right solutions and the right team in place that will allow us to deliver on our promise.  At the same time, we appreciate the fact that delivery of many of these initiatives may not be as fast as people would like, but we must be effective in what we do; we must be consistent and fair in how we treat people; and, above all, the solution must work.  We have achieved a great deal.  We have taken many steps within the bank to change the culture and costs.  At the same time, we have taken many steps to rebuild our lending and restructuring capability.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have taken all of these steps, we recognise that we have more to do than we have already achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100020#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351688700,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy.

They have a difficult challenge to address in this complex transition in the banking environment.<\/p><p>  On the specific concern that AIB was waiting for some solution in the economy, I can tell the committee that that is absolutely not so.  The bulk of the senior team and others who are not here have hardly had a weekend day free.  We are working around the clock to develop, if one thinks about it, one of the biggest financial services firms in the country to service this debt restructuring.  Second, we had to seek approval from the regulators and others for the very products that would be effective in providing the solutions.  Third, we have a complex debt restructuring to take care of and balance it with moral hazard, which is not an excuse.  When one has 85% to 90% of one's mortgage holders paying their mortgages, rushing out and putting a temporary or quick and expedient solution in place for those in distress would be complex and, ultimately, damaging to the economy and those individuals.  At the same time as developing that capability which has been an enormous task, as I stated, we have addressed 33,000 private dwelling house, PDH, customers in stress, 70% of whom have been in a position to make their payments.  There is always an element of truth in these statements, but we are working around the clock to develop advanced capabilities.  At the same time, we have not ignored the reality and tried to address all of these customers.  We are very advanced in the SME sector, too.  We have an objective of within six months having complete coverage of all SMEs in distress and solutions on which we will work with them.  <\/p><p>  On the question of whether we are or have been waiting for something, the answer is, \"No, we have not.\"  At the same time, we respect the fact that the regulators would like us to proceed and be more aggressive in our execution and that there are stresses for people who are living on the edge.  We are trying to address them.  There are no expedient solutions, but we hope to demonstrate in the next 12 months our absolute commitment by what we do, not by what we say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100022#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1351688700,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Duffy and his colleagues from AIB and thank him for all of the information he sent which we have had the opportunity to go through in preparation for the meeting.

It is relatively clear from our perspective.  Our priority has been to get the bank back to sustainable profitability for the very purpose, as I have said, of lending in the economy, returning value to the shareholder - the issue raised by the Deputy - and also helping people in distress.  The issue of how to do this involves all of the things I mentioned in our preamble and significant changes are required to get there.  We have stated our objective is to get to that position by 2014; therefore, that is when we would have profitability.  The purpose behind this is to allow us time to begin - we have begun already and are in numerous discussions - talking about foreign or other investors in the bank.  Our strategy on the first level is to pursue the bank model we can deliver that we would have confidence would attract investors and to begin conversations with these potential investors where the first conversation is about building trust.  Then over two years we would expect to be able to convince them that everything we were doing and delivering would suggest one could trust a management team to execute a model that would deliver sufficient return on investment.  That is the path we are pursuing, regardless of anything else that happens.  These conversations have been positive and people have been pleased to see us back in the marketplace in discussions around these topics.<\/p><p>  With regard to the ESM facility, I really do not have a perspective on whether it will succeed or come to life, or when it will come to life.  Certainly, if there is a positive - if it did come to life - the bank would become a bank that had a foreign investor, that was no longer linked with a sovereign risk and that could be attractive to investors.  There are a number of possible advantages to cheaper funding.  However, the view of the team is that we cannot build a bank strategy around anything we do not control.  We need to build a successful bank model based on the environment we can control and deliver a bank that will be profitable in 2014 and have positive discussions with investors along that curve until 2013.

The former AIB managing director, Mr. Colm Doherty, on reaching his 65th birthday will, apparently, receive a pension of &euro;300,000 per annum.  These figures seem obscene, particularly in the context of what has happened to the bank and the amount of money ordinary taxpayers have had to put into it.

This morning, we heard from executives from the IBRC who told us that their ambition is for the net cost to the Exchequer of the promissory notes to be in the region of &euro;25 billion as opposed to the predicted figure of &euro;34 billion.

In speaking to investors, not one of them would give us any indication of what likely output there would be in terms of a pricing model in the future.  The view is that it is too early in Ireland's case - because we are so linked to the sovereign, which is our shareholder - for them to calculate how they would see us in terms of the value of an investment.

It may be worthwhile to look at the model set out by the IBRC in the documents its delegates laid before us as to where it sees itself going.

To be open and frank, the informal side of it has been a concern.  There was risk aversion in the restructuring of AIB.  Certainly in the early period, people were afraid to bring some credits to the table and were risk-averse in that respect.  Throughout the past six months, whenever I have met many of the Deputies here and others in Government, I have asked those present to bring to us by name any individual company which has not been able to access credit so we can tackle it.  I have given those present my number and e-mail address to this end.  On a positive note, I received notification of a significant number of cases over that time and we were able to resolve many of them satisfactorily.  We have been trying to specifically address the informal world and have spoken with Deputies and the ISME representative group.<\/p> <p>We have met with the ISME executive and every other institution in the financial services world.  As simple and as unsophisticated as it is, we gave them our card and stated they can bring anybody to us, from the Taoiseach all the way down through any other institution. Some of those in this room have brought us people who were not able to access credit and we have been able to resolve the matter.  We recognise a challenge exists at the informal level and this is one of the initiatives we have been rolling out.  As I mentioned earlier, there are also all of the other educational initiatives and travelling throughout the country.<\/p><p> The executive, which numbers an additional four or five people, does not meet at the head office in Bank Centre; it meets only in branches.  For our monthly executive meetings we travel to a branch.  The two most recent meetings have taken place in Kilkenny and Cork.  We meet the staff during the day and spend four or five hours afterwards with small and medium enterprises and individual customers.  At the most recent meeting in Cork we met 50 customers over four hours.  We do not present; instead, we ask the customers what we can do better.  To give a level of comfort, the executive will be on the road for the bulk of the time in direct contact with retail and small and medium enterprise customers throughout the country.  We think this is the best way to learn.  This is an indication of the attempts we are making to deal with the informal world.

If somebody does not make a formal application there is no process by which he or she can make an appeal.  We strongly encourage everyone to make a formal application.  To the end of September 25,000 formal applications were made to AIB of which 92% were approved, which is approximately 23,000 applications.<\/p><p>  With regard to informal applications, we ran a trial for a period of time.

One should know one's customer, and our ability to have people in the branch network who know their customers was severely weakened during the time it was felt people had to move to head office to progress their careers.  To answer the Deputy's specific question, we are taking this skill-set back from head office and putting it into the branches.  We are returning the SME experience which was severely weakened to the branch network and bolstering it with expertise we must source from outside the bank because much of it had left.  We are taking these two steps to return to the basic banking model, which is that people in the field know their customers and make judgments.  We are adding to this a level of approval which has been difficult to discuss because in a regulatory environment such as ours which is changing, requests are made to remove individual authorities from the branch network.  We have been working on standardisation, simplification and a delegated level of authority which we can review monthly in head office but a stand-alone decision can be made locally with a customer in a branch.

I appreciate how comprehensive it was.  As I am restricted by time constraints I will begin my questions.<\/p><p>  A number of people have mentioned the super pensions being paid by the bank.  As these are contractual pensions, the bank's ability is limited.  The Parliament has seen this issue previously, when bonuses were being paid to people who believed they were entitled to them despite the fact that their banks were being propped up by taxpayers' money.  A super levy was introduced.  The bonuses could be paid, but the taxpayer would recoup nearly all of it through a universal social charge levy on persons in institutions being supported by the State.  When we discuss the super pensions, we are not referring to employees' ordinary pensions.  What would be the impact on AIB if legislation was introduced to impose a similar levy on pensions in excess of a certain limit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100026#AA00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351691100,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I cannot figure out what the impact would be.  If legislation entitles the State to reclaim money, it would become a matter between the super pension individuals, as the Deputy defined them, and the litigation.

The Deputy's point is valid.<\/p><p>  As to the deterrent, it would be another contributing factor to the negative environment in which the banks operate.  The greatest background challenge is the operational risk of having a large group of employees in a shrinking bank that is publicly vilified, be it politically or in the press.  Their pay and pensions have been cut and their benefits, for example, cars, are gone.  Name it and it is gone.  If one is in that environment and suddenly something else is done, it will serve to vilify a population, the great majority of which had nothing to do with what happened.

To give the committee the concise and explicit version of what we have just done in Asia, where we met investors at the IMF, and two weeks previously at the Merrill Lynch conference, the world of banking is structurally changing.  UBS, with 10,000 people, changed as a result of the regulatory consequences of old banking models.  Pay scales, business models are changing with Basle III and everything else is changing.  Analysts and those who examine these investments, from Canadian long-only to other short-term venture capital firms, are looking at a yield.  The highest value is a simple and transparent bank.  The comment has been made to us many times.  We will create a model of a bank that is a low-cost provider of a utility type service of payments and cash management, with strong SME capability.  It will primarily be a domestic bank, offering the most advanced technology to facilitate consumers banking when they want, how they want and what they want rather than having to come to the bank and queue up.  We have the technology.  The cost, ease-of-use and ubiquity of the technology for all products should be comparable to the disintermediation threat of PayPal and others coming across the Internet to compete in that space.  The cost-income ratio must be in the low 40s whereas banks today are in the high 40s and early to mid 50s.  It must be an incredibly efficient, low-cost model.  It must offer a simplified range of products.  We have a large number of mortgages, whereas it should be a handful of mortgages.  What will investors think of a bank with a stable market share, with a transparent and simple to understand balance sheet and products that are simple, a bank that is low-cost, high tech and is competitive in terms of ease of use of facilities with anything that is disintermediated, with a strong capital tier 1 ratio and a stable annuity yield of between 8% and 12%?<\/p> <p>If we can present that to investors, what will they think?

If we want to bring a viable and sustainable bank to an investor going forward, we will have to have a net interest margin of 1.5 plus.

The witnesses have made it clear that write-downs are not on the agenda.  Can they justify that position?  The figures we have been given, which show that the bank is getting an additional 1,400 requests for forbearance each month, indicate that the mortgage crisis is getting worse.  More and more people are encountering trouble and asking for help.  Although many people are already in trouble and the crisis is getting worse, we are continuing to approach this problem on a piecemeal basis rather than looking for a radical solution that could take this albatross from around people's necks, get them out of trouble and boost the economy.  We all know that the level of mortgage distress is operating as a huge macroeconomic dampener on the economy.  Can the witnesses tell me why it is better to take a piecemeal individual approach, involving restructuring and forbearance, than to adopt our approach of writing down to current market value the unsustainable debt that was incurred during the period of the property boom caused by developers and banks?  If our approach was pursued, how much would it cost?  On the basis of the bank's figures - we have been told that the volume of negative equity is approximately &euro;6.8 billion and that &euro;1.9 billion of that is currently impaired - I estimate that the additional cost of writing down the negative equity would be approximately &euro;5 billion.  Is it not the case that the bank has been recapitalised to do that?  The Irish banks are probably among the most recapitalised institutions in Europe.  Why can this not just be done?  It would help distressed mortgage holders and the economy at the same time.

I should mention, in order to be balanced, that we are looking at the totality of unsustainable debt, including mortgages, SMEs, buy-to-lets, commercial real estate and unsecured debt.  All of those elements, taken together, comprise the debt burden that society has.  It is not just one asset class.  In the context of our addressing of the totality of the debt, we are figuring out how to reduce the burden, what is sustainable in the eyes of our customers and feasible in terms of repayment over a continuum, and what is unsustainable in the manner suggested by the Deputy.  We will then consider whether that can be addressed by writing some of the debt off.  It has been suggested that we are not looking at any write-downs, but in fact we are.  We are doing so in the context of all the asset classes of debt, rather than just one.

Much of what we are doing is being done with the intention of driving it in that way.  The Deputy correctly mentioned that the negative equity on AIB's mortgage book is &euro;6.8 billion.  Under the prudential capital assessment review, we have provisions of &euro;2.8 billion in place for that book.  We have also made provision for other asset classes and books, etc.  It would be irresponsible of AIB, as a Government-owned bank that has been recapitalised by the taxpayer, to approach the mortgage arrears and default problem that is being experienced by the bank and the country by writing off all negative equity overnight.  It is not a solution for the country.  As Mr. Duffy and I have already said, we need to get people into restructured loans that they can afford, if at all possible.  Between 69% and 70% of our 33,700 customers who are in forbearance are affording the new restructured loans we have put them into.  This approach is working, in the main.  It is obvious that there are problems with between 25% and 30% of the customers in question.  That is why the banks have been initiating advanced forbearance under the supervision of the Central Bank over the past year.  We are trying to restructure these customers' loans in a deeper way to see whether we can get them onto a sustainable path again.  That is the approach.  It relates to affordability rather than to negative equity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100029#DD00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1351692900,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I reject the argument that by coming to an arrangement with people that enables them to just about manage, AIB is somehow offering a solution to the damage to the economy that is being caused by the fact that so many people are in mortgage distress.

Even if an arrangement is reached that allows people to just about manage, as long as they are continuing to pay off the inflated mortgages that resulted from the property madness, they will be limping along for many years to come and therefore will not be able to contribute substantially to the restoration of economic demand.<\/p> <p>I do not accept that is the case.  Furthermore, I put it to AIB that given it is getting more requests for forbearance - 1,400 extra requests - the situation continues to worsen and deteriorate.  It is obvious we need more radical solutions.  AIB asserted in its response that this is not the answer for the economy.

However, in the opinion of many, AIB is not responding fast enough or significantly enough to that public pressure and this has to do with the fact AIB is trying to make itself attractive to private investors.

There is a strong accusation being made that by sleight of hand many retailers who had machines last week and who signed the paper for them, thinking they were just conducting the normal transaction, found they were no longer in a rental agreement that could be cancelled easily but had moved into a two or three year lease agreement.  In the event of their business closing, they find they are locked into a three year lease agreement on the machine.

This is all very positive and it is good to hear staff in both loan and asset management are being retrained.  These initiatives and others mentioned here this afternoon give the impression AIB is actually rebuilding the bank, almost from the ground up.  Clearly, some huge problems were discovered when this team took over at AIB.  If it is the situation that significant internal restructuring is being undertaken and that the team must go right to the ground level to do that, is it not a bit premature to talk about getting investors, particularly if there are structural problems and problems with loan management to be dealt with.<\/p><p>  One of the issues discussed here, tracker mortgages, which amount to approximately &euro;20 billion, make up a sizeable proportion of the existing loans.  These will be loss makers for a number of years, not to mention the buy to let loans, which are significant loss makers.  Also, there is &euro;5.7 billion of impaired speculative loans, mainly land.  Almost &euro;5 billion of that amount could be written off as there has been discounting of up to 90% on that type of loan.  That is another &euro;5 billion loss, before we even start drilling down into the issue of arrears.<\/p> <p>The bank is facing huge problems, yet the delegates are talking about seeking to attract investors, almost like they are preparing for a sale.  I wonder whether that is a little premature.<\/p><p> The delegates spoke about building sustainable profits and balancing competing interests.  On the one hand there is the shareholder interest, which is our interest because the taxpayer is heavily involved.  On the other hand, however, is the debt restructuring issue and the need for some type of solution for small and medium-sized businesses and householders in serious arrears.  The delegates spoke a great deal about restructuring, but the question that arises in this regard is why there is such resistance to debt forgiveness.  Is it because the bank is of the view that there is no capacity within the system at this time to engage in a process of examining customers' debts, assets and income with a view possibly to writing off at least a portion of their debt?  Or is it simply the case that there is a general policy of opposition to debt forgiveness in any form across all the banks?  Going from what we heard from the IBRC delegates this morning and on previous occasions from representatives of other banks, one might conclude that the latter is the case and that there is a collective strong resistance to any write-off of debt.  It is one of the issues that is constantly raised with public representatives.<\/p><p> The other major issue we are hearing about is the difficulty of obtaining loans.  In fact, what we are hearing outside these Houses does not correspond to what the delegates are saying in this meeting today.  Every time I speak to people at events, particularly business events, I hear very detailed stories about how they were refused a loan.  There is a need to clarify what is happening in this regard. <\/p><p> I conclude by voicing my appreciation to Mr. Duffy for making himself and his team so accessible to us.  That is a very positive development and it allows us to redirect queries to them with ease.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100031#FF04200","speaker":"1095","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351694700,"counter":969,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Duffy responds, I ask Deputy Arthur Spring to take the Chair for a short period.

To be explicit on this point, there will be no investors really soon.  What we are saying is that investors look at the evolution of a bank, and some might wish to come in earlier in that evolution where they see the price of entry being cheaper and the potential for profiting as things improve.  Other investors might choose to become involved at a later stage.  We are not targeting investors for a price but rather for trust and confidence.  Our view is that it is never too early to start building trust and credibility with all classes of investors.  We do not have to accept anybody's offer at any time.  It is not a matter of rushing to sell; it is about the Government making the decision on price and us preparing the ground as well and as thoroughly as we can in anticipation of investors of all types possibly engaging in a debate.  It is a question of balance.  We are seeking to build the credibility necessary to create that option and it is then at our discretion, collectively with the Government, as to when the choice is taken to exercise that option.  That is the nature of what we are trying to do.  We recognise fully the many challenges we are facing in this regard.  However, many investors are not put off by the severity of the challenges facing the world of banking.  In fact, many are of the view that Ireland as an economy and the bank as a link to the sovereign are among the first to emerge out of the chaos of recent years.  That possibly makes us an attractive investment prospect and we will do whatever we can do to encourage people to think about us in that way.  Timing and price, however, are a Government issue and we will not seek to influence that.<\/p><p>  On the question of whether there is a reluctance to consider debt forgiveness, it is important, first, to ensure that we are all talking about the same thing when we have this discussion.  In particular, it is important to recognise the difference between debt forgiveness and debt restructuring, which includes write-offs.  The phrase \"debt forgiveness\" suggests to us the notion that debt can somehow be magically waived.  However, the moral hazard and the absolute inequity of those types of decisions places one on very dangerous territory given the reality that lots of people are paying their debts.  The question would immediately arise as to why one person's obligations should be waived simply because he or she made a bad decision which another person, who is not receiving any benefit, did not.  When we say that debt forgiveness is not a policy we are supportive of, that is the reason.  Blanket forgiveness without regard to the moral hazard and inequity of unbalanced dealings with different people in different situations is not a solution that works.  What we are saying is that we are working on the principle of affordability, as Mr. Murphy mentioned.  We seek to address, on an individual basis, what is sustainable debt and what people can afford within the mix.  In such circumstances, the bank does look at write-offs of debt.  That is the approach we are taking rather than simply blanket forgiveness.<\/p><p>  The third issue the Deputy raised related to the difficulty in securing loans.  There is an evolution going on here and our primary obligation in this is education.  We have to get out in the marketplace, which is why we are doing what we are doing.  For example, we are saying to members of the committee that if a person approaches them with a problem, they should pass the details on and we will try to assist.  We have engaged with local radio, arranged meetings in town halls and so on in an effort to get our message out.  It is a matter of putting feet on the ground throughout the country in order to identify where problems are arising.  In recent months I have seen thousands of SME owners, including 30 CEOs in one go.  I have seen SME owners in large groupings and I have seen individual customers.  On each occasion I put some very simple questions to those sitting in front of me.  When I asked, for instance, who in the room wanted more debt, no hands were raised.  On the other hand, when I asked who was seeking restructuring or equity, a lot of hands went up.  The reality is that there are pockets of the economy that are doing very well, including the agri sector and others, where there is a requirement for more debt.  We must, however, be very careful and responsible about pushing more debt onto those who are already too heavily indebted and who should instead be offered other solutions.  We are seeing a low-demand domestic economy.  In our view, there is a need for equity, as well as restructuring, in that low-demand economy to balance out the absolute burden of debt.<\/p><p>  Would Deputy Twomey like my colleague, Mr. Byrne, to expand on this last issue or does he wish to ask another question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100032#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1351694700,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy for his response.

As Mr. Murphy outlined, we have been very successful in reforming and reshaping the mortgage process so that people feel confident that they can submit an application and get a response.  We are doing a lot of work at this time on the SME issue.  It is a much trickier matter which requires a whole ecosystem in which people have the confidence that they can approach the bank and have a reasonable chance of getting the right answer from it.  We are doing our piece in this regard through initiatives such as SME seminars.  In conjunction with ActionCOACH, we have initiated a scheme whereby SME owners who attend out seminars can be allocated a third-party coach who will go into their business for one day to assist them.  We are providing the funding for that for 3,000 businesses.

In my own case, as a top executive I came in on the cap.  I took a decision with the senior executives to make a proposal to the board to reduce our pay by 15%, which we did, and that has been implemented.  All of those executives have lost all benefits associated with it and pensions have also been cut and discounted severely.  As we mentioned earlier, the defined benefit plan closed and instead, there are lower levels of contribution on a defined contributions plan.  We have been implementing cuts not only at our level but throughout all levels of the organisation.  There have been cuts of 10% at lower levels and, as we got to the lowest levels of the organisation, we felt it was inappropriate to impose cuts and instigated pay freezes.  Within the context of the overall expense of the organisation, which is the broader issue with which we concern ourselves, we have looked at tackling the absolute cost of people.  We have been able to reduce the number of people in receipt of more than &euro;100,000 by 40%, and where there were a certain number receiving more than &euro;200,000, we have taken that down by 60%.  While we still have plenty of work to do, we think it is appropriate to rebalance the cost equation in the bank and consequently, we started with the executive.  Even though I came in on the salary cap and others came in on less than the cap, we all accepted, on foot of our own proposal, a 15% cut in our compensation.  We then thought the entire bank needed to take some pain, which we did, after which we thought that the absolute number of people on higher salary levels needed to be reduced materially, and it has been.  I am not saying our work is complete but we recognise that level of adjustment is the first phase of adjustment that is required in the bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100033#HH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1351695300,"counter":978,"content":"<p>Is the salary cap approximately &euro;500,000?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100033#HH00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351695300,"counter":979,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100033#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1351695300,"counter":980,"content":"<p>Consequently, the top three salaries must be close to &euro;500,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100033#HH00400","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351695300,"counter":981,"content":"<p>I will not get into pointing out individual salaries in this room but, to be explicit, I came in on the cap and then reduced it by 15%.

The figures that were given indicated the percentage of investment to gross domestic product is at a 60-year low within the eurozone, with a figure of &euro;2 trillion in uninvested profits by big business sitting in banks and financial institutions.  I have seen a figure for Ireland, which I cannot source precisely, of perhaps &euro;32 billion of uninvested profits within a short period.  Does AIB find substantial corporate funds resting in its accounts that are not going into productive use - that is, towards investment, job creation and so on - considering that the number of unemployed within the European Union is 25 million?

I put it to Mr. Duffy and to Mr. Murphy that this is a moral issue, in that there was a young generation of Irish workers who, during the bubble, were blackmailed due to the grip financial speculators and developers had on the housing market.  If such people wanted a home for a family or whatever, they had no option but to go for the extortionate prices, the 40-year mortgages and all the rest of it.  That generation is now stranded, and I put it to the witnesses that there is a moral issue in this regard.  While it pertains to society and not simply to the bank, as an important player therein, does the bank not have a moral responsibility to try to unwind this injustice that was done?  I put it to the witnesses that there would be huge merit in having an across-the-board scheme of reducing the crazy prices for which homes were bought down to the current value and calibrating the monthly payments downwards accordingly.<\/p> <p>That would relieve enormous stress and it would also perhaps release some billions of euro into the domestic economy to try to revive it.

I have as many of them coming to me now as I had in practice.  The reason AIB is not lending to SMEs is that while there is new lending, a lot of restructuring is converting overdrafts to term loans.  The SMEs are not able to function in business because effectively they do not have an adequate supply of working capital.<\/p><p>  My view was that AIB had a part to play.  The bank has to restructure but I thought that we were all in this together and that it was not a case of AIB seeking to repair its balance sheet.  The mortgage sector and restructuring have been referred to but I am talking specifically about the real economy.  I am talking about SMEs that may employ two or three people.  They are unable to expand, as they have been explaining to me.  AIB was a very aggressive bank over the years and that was shown up particularly in the DIRT inquiry.  The bank has ridden very much to the forefront.  I would like to see AIB riding to the forefront in SME lending.  Mr. Duffy has made points but the figures do not reflect what we are getting from punters on the ground.

After the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, announced the NAMA model, I examined the balance sheets of the six banks.

This can be explained by the fact that average salaries in the Polish bank are low compared to those of home and English-based employees.  The capital injection was &euro;20.7 billion and the aim is to get the bank to sustainable profitability and develop a model to attract investors to rehabilitate the bank.

The balance sheet states the bank&rsquo;s total assets come to &euro;130 billion.  What do the European Central Bank, ECB, and other interbank advances come to?  The balance sheet lists other assets at &euro;50 billion.  What are these assets?  It must be remembered that loans for buy-to-let properties or land speculation may be worse than we think.  Perhaps mortgages will suffer another tsunami.  This means the &euro;80 billion net needs further provision.  Perhaps we should start doing surgery rather than with provision.  It is time to recalibrate loans through debt restructuring rather than debt forgiveness.  Independent News and Media, for example, has had to restructure its debt and it did not leave creditors hanging.  We need creditor buy-in in the banking system, which must be done by the Central Bank and the ECB.  We do not necessarily have to wait for the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, to be set up, with its banking supervision function.  We need a creditor to step into the shoes of the bond investors in AIB in the same way that was done with Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p><p>  There is still much confusion about the &euro;25 billion estimate for the loans embedded in Anglo Irish Bank.  Irish Bank Resolution Corporation&rsquo;s loan losses are reduced by the drip feed of income from the promissory note which comes to &euro;18 billion in interest.  That is a liquid asset being injected into the bank&rsquo;s balance sheet at intervals to pay off the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, provided.  The ELA was the originating cause because it was needed to redeem the bond investors in full to save the euro.  If one adds the income of &euro;18 billion plus the embedded losses of &euro;25 billion, it comes to a loss of &euro;43 billion.  Depending on how much interest comes into the IBRC by way of the promissory note, it adds to the estimated losses of &euro;25 billion.<\/p> <p> I am concerned about investors in the buy-to-let market not those who came in on the last wave but those who genuinely built up investment property portfolios and managed them in a professional way, letting them to answer a demand for accommodation in city markets.  The interest on their carrying loans in their portfolios is now being restricted by the Department of Finance in terms of its allowability as an expense to be deducted from rental income for income tax assessment purposes.  That is another timebomb because that interest restriction is actually growing.  It should be reversed if we want to save that category of investor.  It is not a question of a free lunch but one of survival.  I urge the bank to raise the matter in its pre-budget submission to the Government.  I asked representatives from the IBRC to do the same this morning.  <\/p><p> When it comes to restructuring loans, whether they are mortgages-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100035#KK00700","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351697100,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>Let me make a brief interjection.

I wish to corroborate what was said in that it is open to any of us to get in touch with AIB.  I did so and I am grateful because a case in south Kerry was solved to my satisfaction.<\/p><p>  I accept what was said about staff.  I have dealt with AIB for a long time and know many of its staff.  I appreciate its difficulties in motivating them because morale is low.  However, I salute what Mr. Duffy and his team are trying to achieve.  Approximately 2,500 staff will leave, 1,700 of whom will have gone by the end of the year.  However, the bank is also taking on people, particularly new graduates.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Duffy has said the bank is ahead in lending, but that seems to be in conflict with what we heard from Deputy Kieran O'Donnell.  I ask Mr. Duffy to clarify the point.  What does he mean by saying AIB is ahead in lending?  If I understood what was said correctly, 41% of SME loans have been or are being restructured.  Does this mean that 59% have yet to be restructured?  <\/p><p>  If the bank is hiring new staff, one assumes they will need training.  I gather some of the new staff might be graduates and perhaps the bank might allow them to deal with the restructuring because the most important area on which the bank should focus is new lending.  I appreciate that we do not want to have more bad debts and that many people are reluctant to take on more debt, but there are genuine cases in which credit is needed.  It is very important that the right staff deal with such cases.  Coupled with this, I welcome what was said about the meetings in branches in Kilkenny and Cork.  There seems to be a slight drift of control of lending away from head office towards branches.  Is there a new authorisation or credit limit in operation or due to be put into operation for branch managers who know what the situation is locally?  That would be welcomed if it was so.  <\/p><p>  I ask Mr. Duffy to answer my questions on lending and the hiring of staff.  Staff are employed on an agency basis for NAMA.  How many AIB staff are working full-time for NAMA, dealing with receivers and so forth?  What level of remuneration is the bank receiving from NAMA for such work?  <\/p><p>  I loved what Mr. Duffy said about being back in profit by 2014.  We all hope that will be the case.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Duffy dealt with the issue of a sale to foreign investors and I totally accept his answer.  He also spoke about the economy.  I ask him to give us his prediction as to when he expects us to return to growth.  We are all very interested in his answer.<\/p><p>  I wish Mr. Duffy and AIB the very best.  We have a vested interest in AIB becoming profitable as soon as possible for the sake of the taxpayer, but we hope it will happen without people being screwed, if I may put it like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100036#LL02700","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351697100,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his comments.

Will AIB comment on the mis-selling of payment protection policies and the associated Central Bank investigation?  How many AIB customers were involved and what is the total cost to the bank?<\/p><p>  The Chairman raised the issue of payment processing services.  It seems that as we are entering a cashless society many small businesses will be put severely at risk because the costs of having the machines is prohibitive in the first place.  Generally my barber or the dry cleaners cannot take a Laser card.  Unless a business is a high volume cash shop such as a newsagent or grocery it will not be able to take them.  The local farm shop will not take them.  Swipe cards are being introduced with a value of under &euro;15.  Businesses that depend on such transactions will be at a severe disadvantage because they do not have the machines.  It would be a help to small businesses if the costs were reduced.   I realise this is not only a matter for AIB.  There are various companies involved in this area and I understand AIB is involved in a joint venture, but it seems to be a major issue and it will get worse for these businesses as the take-up of these swipe cards becomes more widespread.<\/p><p>  The standard financial statement for mortgages comes from the Central Bank requirement.   It seems to be the most extensive means test conducted by anyone in this country.  It is more extensive that the medical card or social welfare means test.  A social welfare means test does not take account of expenditure, only one's income.  The medical card uses three or four items of expenditure as a way of reducing one's income for the purposes of getting a medical card but the standard financial statement goes into remarkable detail in respect of expenditure going out.  It seems to be a burden on the banks and it give the banks a bad name because people have no wish to be dealing with the banks, especially when someone has a bad experience and it gets out.  The process could be dramatically simplified.  We could have standard levels of income or percentages of income to correspond to a mortgage.  A mortgage could be no more than 30% or 35% of one's gross or net income, whatever way it works out.  Does AIB foresee any difficulty with that or does it wish to see this changed?  Is this a burden on the bank?  It is humiliating for people to have to list their expenditure to banks in ways not required by the State.<\/p><p>  The advanced forbearance options referred to include split mortgages, trading down, voluntary losses and mortgage-to-rent.  However, I do not see shared equity solutions, although a split mortgage may be a type of arrangement.<\/p><p>  Was the Ms Justice Dunne judgment discussed earlier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100037#MM01300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1351697700,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>It was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100037#MM01400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1351697700,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>Has AIB been in discussions with the Department of Finance in this regard?

EBS and AIB sell payment protection insurance in three main areas, namely, alongside mortgages, personal credit and credit cards.  Since the inception of the consumer protection code in August 2007, some 160,000 customers have bought a PPI product from us.  PPI has acquired a bad name in the United Kingdom in the past five or six years, where penetration rates were as high as 95% in some products.  In other words, if one took out a mortgage, there was a 95% chance one would also purchase payment protection from the same provider.  In Ireland, on the other hand, penetration rates have never been more than approximately 25%.  Therefore, we believe this issue is on a different scale in this country compared with what happened in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>  Our review of PPI is ongoing and will continue until the end of 2013.  There is no need for customers to do anything in this regard - all of them will be contacted by 7 December this year.  One in five of our customers has made a PPI claim against his or her contract in the past five years, and four out of five of those claims have been upheld and paid out.  In other words, it is a product that has been of real value to customers.  As I said, we believe the situation here is quite different from that in the United Kingdom.  We are doing all we can to assist customers in this regard and will have contacted all of them by 7 December.<\/p><p>  In regard to the standard financial statement, I agree with the Senator that it is very comprehensive.  We follow the format prescribed by the Central Bank, which includes a huge amount of detail in regard to expenditure.  In fairness to the customer and to the bank, it is very important that we understand where the former is at in regard to affordability.  We must ensure he or she has sufficient income to have a reasonable standard of living thereafter.  The SFS, burdensome as it can be, does clarify the situation very strongly.  Although it might be possible to have a slimmed down version, it is important that we can clearly see the nature of the expenditure for a particular individual or family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100038#NN00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1351698300,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>When a person becomes unemployed, he or she applies to the Department of Social Protection for jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit, to the Health Service Executive for a medical card and, if he or she has a mortgage, to the bank to discuss repayment options.

I accept that this information retrieval is mandated by the Central Bank, but it seems to me to be superfluous.  Would it not be better from the bank's point of view, in terms of administration, time and staff resources, simply to assume a certain level of expenditure?

Would the banks prefer not to have to deal with the level of detail required in the standard financial statement?  Would it be possible to operate a fair system with a more broad-based approach?

People should be able to spend the remainder of their money as they wish.

In order that there will be no misunderstanding, when I refer to restructuring of AIB's client loans - mortgage loans, buy-to-let loans and SME loans - I mean including a write-down in order that the loans will be recalibrated to reflect what the current, reasonable and maintainable profits of the borrower can bear.  Otherwise, our guests will only be fooling themselves and playing at \"shadow banking\".  That is not on.  If standard variable rates increase from 4% to 6%, that is a 50% increase.  If people are under stress and strain at a figure of 4%, their levels will rise again by 50% if there is an increase to 6%.  This only adds to the argument of ensuring the recalibration or restructuring, including a write-down, is done sooner rather than later.<\/p><p>  I echo what other members have stated, namely, that people are under enormous stress.

I have, therefore, been on the battlefield, which is why I am of the view that it is important to clean up the position and not leave loans to fester or park 50% of them in no man's land.

There are not many sectors in which that is the position.  Our exposure to the sector is &euro;1.9 billion at this stage.  The fund to which the Deputy refers is a new one.  We have a series of funds.  We find that if one has a fund and one has something in the shop window, it is easier for people to say \"I'll get a bit of that\" and \"I understand what the agri-fund is\".  We have many specialists in the regions who are supporting the six advisers who do nothing other than concentrate on the agri-sector.  We are very positive in that regard.<\/p><p>  In respect of the new sectors to which the Deputy referred - clean tech, energy and medical - we have put a start-up team in place.  This comprises ten people whose sole focus is to concentrate on these emerging sectors.  We know we need to know more about these industries, particularly as they are different from those industries to which the banks have traditionally lent.  We are moving up the curve in terms of the knowledge-base.  Much of this is simple.  Providing the first item of advice and credit for a small start-up is very different from dealing with traditional manufacturing business.  We accept the point and are pursuing a series of initiatives to try to help them move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100039#OO00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1351698900,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>Do the staff in the NAMA divisions know the price at which individual loans were sold to NAMA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100039#OO01000","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351698900,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>The NAMA process was very public in the context of how the final tranches were transferred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100039#OO01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1351698900,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>Yes, but do the staff involved know the prices of the individual loans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012103100039#OO01200","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351698900,"counter":1111,"content":"<p>Case managers would know the position on the portfolios for which they are responsible.
