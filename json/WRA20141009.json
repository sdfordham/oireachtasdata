Regulations governing normal residence for child benefit purposes are contained in S.I. 142\/2007 (Article 159) and they provide <i>inter alia<\/i>for the following: <br\/><br\/>(1) In the event that a qualified child is resident with both mother and father, he or she will be regarded as normally residing with the mother or step-mother.<br\/><br\/>(2) If mother and father are resident in separate households, the qualified child shall be regarded as normally residing with the person with whom he or she resides for the majority of the time.<br\/><br\/>In practice, child benefit is paid to the child&rsquo;s mother in all cases except where the parents are separated and the father has responsibility for the full-time care of the child for more than 50% of the time.  <br\/><br\/>The regulations governing the scheme does not provide for the splitting of the payment between parties in cases of shared residency arrangements for the child.  <br\/><br\/>If the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered in further detail by the Department, I will arrange this if she sends me the details.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900043#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":75,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 39 and 40 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Appeals","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900043#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[38764\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900043#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an illness benefit appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>Payment of illness benefit to the person concerned was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.<\/p><p>  An appeal was registered on 6 October 2014 and the Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that, in accordance with statutory requirements, the Department was asked for the documentation in the case and the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s comments on the grounds of the appeal.

My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being controlled and we monitor the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against Departmental published expenditure profiles.  Overall net expenditure to end-September, 2014 amounted to &euro;30,982 million.  This was broadly on target at just &euro;14 million ahead of profile.  The year-on-year reduction in expenditure amounted to &euro;630 million, a decrease of 2.0%.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the progress made on reform, since this Government took office, sustainable and far reaching Public Service Reform has been a key element of our strategy to meet the challenges that have faced the country in recent years.  Public Service Reform will also continue to play a key role in our recovery.  <\/p><p>  We published our first Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011.  A Progress Report on the Reform Plan was published in September 2012 and a second Progress Report was published in January this year (www.reformplan.per.gov.ie).  These reports set out the significant progress that has been made to date.  <\/p><p>  Some examples of this progress include:<\/p><p>  - while meeting increased demand for services, we have reduced staff numbers by around 32,000 or 10% since 2008 and the paybill has been reduced from &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to a forecasted &euro;13.6 billion net by end 2014;<\/p><p> - new working arrangements have been introduced, including longer working hours, new rosters, and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave;<\/p><p> - we are implementing a radical overhaul of our approach to public procurement, with the Office of Government Procurement targeting savings of &euro;500 million over three years;<\/p><p> - Peoplepoint the Civil Service wide Human Resources and Pensions Shared Services Centre has been operational since March last year and now services over 25,000 employees across 19 organisations;<\/p><p> - an Action Plan to deliver efficiencies in the State's property portfolio was published in mid 2013 and is currently being implemented;<\/p><p> - we have issued over 800,000 Public Services Cards, which are currently being used for social welfare payments and the free travel scheme, and will cover a greater range of services over time;<\/p><p> - the Office of Government Chief Information Officer has been established to maximise the potential benefits of digitalisation in delivering services and information;<\/p><p> - the Government services portal - www.gov.ie - includes quick links to more than 400 information and transaction services;<\/p><p> - we have launched a new Open Data portal - www.data.gov.ie - and a consultation process on data sharing;<\/p><p> - a series of public expenditure reforms have been implemented to bring greater structure, scrutiny and openness to budgeting;<\/p><p> - we are making good progress in implementing our programme of political and legislative reform, aimed at enhancing openness, transparency and accountability; and<\/p><p> - we will shortly publish a Civil Service Renewal Plan setting out a new vision and strategy for the Civil Service.<\/p><p>  In January this year, I published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016.  The actions set out in the Reform Plan include greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement and property management; increased accountability and transparency in public decision making; enhanced leadership and performance management; and a continued focus on building the required capacity and capability to deliver reform and service improvements across the Public Service.  Overall, I am satisfied that both the strong progress made to date and our future plans are in line with best practice across Europe and that the progress we are making is well regarded internationally.<\/p><p>  In relation to the upcoming Budget, this Government has made some very difficult but necessary decisions over the past 3 years, decisions which have resulted in the restoration of a sustainable and viable economic future for the citizens of this Country.  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure is currently being concluded and will inform Government decisions that will underpin the basis of the multi-annual expenditure ceilings which will be published as part of the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015 - 2017.

The market situation for pelagic fish is currently challenging, as Russia has banned the importation of pelagic fish and Russia has been an important market for mackerel, in particular.\u00a0If illegally caught fish are being placed on the market, it displaces and reduces prices for those operators, the majority of our industry, who are abiding by the rules set down.\u00a0In my view, it is in the interest of the industry as a whole to have strong and fair arrangements in place that give confidence that the rules apply across the board and that all operators are abiding by the quota allocations made available to them.<\/p><p>  In order to inform the Deputy, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has sent me a report\u00a0 on the issues that have given rise to the current situation, the actions taken and the current state of consultation between the SFPA and the industry.<\/p><p>  The permits which allow in-factory weighting had lapsed due to the SFPA's overall lack of confidence in the operation of the weighing systems.

Under management arrangements introduced in 2010 for mackerel and in 2011 for herring in the North West (Area VIaS) smaller vessels have access to these stocks on the following basis. In the North West, an open herring fishery was established of up to 5% of the Area VIa South adjusted quota, to provide modest monthly catch limits, for vessels under 20m length overall. No booking-in is required. Draft ring net fisherman were accommodated under this allocation.<\/p><p>  In relation to Mackerel there are two fisheries for small boats. Vessels under 18m in overall length, using trawls or gill nets, have access to a periodic boat catch limit (e.g. monthly, bi-monthly), subject to available quota. There is also a Hook and line fishery for vessels under 15m in overall length. Vessels using hooks and line to fish for mackerel may not engage in trawling or gill netting in the same trip as they fish using hook and line fishing gear. 400t of mackerel is reserved each year for the hook and line fishery.<\/p><p>  Periodic allocations are made available for operators covered by these arrangements. Each month I receive recommendations from industry representatives at the Quota Management Advisory Committee in relation to the monthly amounts available to the small boat herring and mackerel. In some months the North West herring small boat fishing allocation has covered a two monthly period to facilitate smaller boats.

From my discussions with the Garda authorities I am assured that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region keep this deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of policing resources.<\/p><p>  I do of course appreciate the issues of concern which the Deputy has raised and would draw his attention to the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan which has been operational since June 2013.  Garda actions under the Plan include dedicated high visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares.  These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand studies and footfall in the areas in question.  I am also aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests in the city centre area with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.<\/p><p>  The Garda approach includes focusing resources on specific areas of the city according to need.   As part of this, a number of targeted city centre policing operations are in place.<\/p><p>  These operations include Operation Pier, which concentrates on the South Quays and Temple Bar area.  This operation includes the designation of certain areas as &quot;hotspots&quot; for anti-social behaviour and regular uniformed and plain clothes patrols.  Other Garda Operations in the city centre include Operation Spire which is focussed on the O&rsquo;Connell Street and North Inner City areas, and Operation Stilts which is an ongoing overt policing operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug-related crime in Dublin city centre locations.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the perspectives of business and community interests about the effects of certain types of crime and anti-social behaviour on the environment for business and leisure and on the overall quality of life for residents.  Some of the problems faced are linked to disorder associated with abuse of alcohol and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with a wide range of businesses involved in the entertainment and nighttime economy to address these issues so that people can enjoy themselves without concern for their welfare. <\/p><p>  Other challenges have their origin in even more complex social phenomena which go well beyond the capacity of criminal justice agencies to address on their own.  Dealing with these matters requires a co-ordinated approach from state agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as through partnership with business, community and voluntary groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already a long term partner in a range of local consultative and representative structures in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am considering how we can step up this cooperation with a view to developing collaborative solutions to the range of issues which affect policing and the overall quality of the environment in our urban centres, and I intend to engage further with the Garda authorities in that regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900047#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Marriage Equality Referendum","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900047#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[38607\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900047#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason there is a delay in setting the date for the marriage equality referendum due some time in 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>There is no delay in setting the date for the marriage equality referendum.

One of the Key Recommendations identified by the group was that the student\/probationer training programme should be radically restructured <br\/><br\/>The course for Garda trainees is a high level BA course, which necessitates a certain academic capability.  The revised training programme stemming from the recommendations of the Review Group was devised in order to better prepare recruits for the modern policing environment.  <br\/><br\/>The main differences between the new and the previous programme is that the new programme carries a greater emphasis on operational policing and focuses on real life scenarios which in turn prepare students for the policing challenges they will face. The new programme will also instil a lifelong learning philosophy for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a suite of mandatory and elective courses made available.<br\/><br\/>The restructured student\/probationer training will be carried out in three phases.  Phase I is for 32 weeks at the Garda College, at the end of which successful students will be attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers).

However, as the Deputy will be aware, Government approval was received on 19 November 2013 to proceed with drafting the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013. The legislation has now been passed by the Seanad and Second Stage concluded in the D&aacute;il last week. <\/p><p>  Standardised packaging, also known as plain or generic packaging, means that all forms of branding &ndash; trademarks, logos, colours and graphics &ndash; would be removed from retail tobacco packaging, except for the brand and variant names, which would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands on the market.  All packs would be in a plain neutral colour, except for the mandatory health warnings and the tax stamp.  This measure is considered proportionate from a public health perspective. <\/p><p>  The Deputy refers to the position of the American Chamber of Commerce as presented to the EU in relation to trademarks as being universally recognised as rights of property conferring the right to use such a property, the right to registration of which should not be dependent in any way on the nature of the product, and should not be subjected to unjustified restrictions on their use.  <\/p><p>  A trade mark is the means by which a business identifies its goods or services and distinguishes them from the goods and services supplied by other businesses. The main purpose of trade mark law is to protect the rights holders&rsquo; investment in the reputation of his goods and services and to assist the consumer in differentiating among competing goods and services in the marketplace. <\/p><p>  The importance of trademarks cannot be understated and Ireland is recognised as having a robust legal framework in place to support this property right. In particular, trade marks have been protected under a number of European and international laws where well-respected principles were established, including the Paris Convention for the protection of Industrial Property dating from 1883 and, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property rights Agreement of 1994 (TRIPs). The TRIPs Agreement introduced intellectual property (IP) into the international trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property to date. <\/p><p>  However, whether at international or domestic level, trade mark rights are not, of themselves, absolute rights and States are permitted to apply derogations that allow for the suspension of part of the legal obligation which can operate to restrict some rights under certain circumstances such as in the pursuit of broader compelling public policy reasons or for greater public interest considerations. The Irish Constitution likewise recognises that the State may delimit by law the exercise of property rights where required by the common good.<\/p><p>  This Government continues to focus on ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s intellectual property regime, including its trademark regime compares favourably with best international practice and to work to further reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a country where strong intellectual property rights play a crucial role.   <\/p><p>  Finally, I would like to point out to the Deputy that tobacco consumption is today the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people a year; that smokers die on average 10 years sooner than non-smokers; that one in every two children who experiment with cigarettes goes on to become a smoker, and that one in every two of them will die from a tobacco related disease. In this context, the priority is to reduce the consumption of tobacco across the board, to meet our policy target of making  Ireland tobacco free (i.e. with a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900049#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900049#WRH01800"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[38810\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900049#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to shortages in therapy services for students in special schools; and her plans to ensure an adequate level of such support services.","asker":"1178","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has recognised the need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way services for children with disabilities are delivered.

This has resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <br\/><br\/>A major new deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  This agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in nine EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK)and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs. <br\/><br\/>A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry, in 2012.  Under this Agreement the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine, this was further reduced to 40% from 1 May 2014.  This has resulted in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.<br\/><br\/>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  This is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<br\/><br\/>The reference price for Anastrozole is &euro;28 per pack of 28 tablets with effect from 1 May 2014.  In setting the reference price the HSE took account of prices across the EU, where there is significant variation in price, and sought to balance value for money versus sustainability of supply in a small market.  The reference price represents a 39% reduction and is subject to review on an annual basis. <br\/><br\/>In the case of drugs and medicines which are reimbursed by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland.  However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  It would nonetheless be disappointing if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients. <br\/><br\/>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. <br\/><br\/>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies.  In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines.<br\/><br\/>There are no plans to extend access to free medication to cancer patients specifically under the community drugs schemes.

This review placed significant emphasis on international best practice and the application of these practices to existing service provision in Ireland. <\/p><p>   The major deliverable of the review was a detailed report based on three key components: capacity and data, work practices, admission polices &amp;amp; related clinical issues.  The report recommended that the number of critical care beds should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020.  It also recommended a model for the delivery of adult critical care that is underpinned by a network approach, whereby &lsquo;hub&rsquo;, &lsquo;spoke&rsquo;, and &lsquo;local&rsquo; hospitals  work together to provide the patient with safe and high quality critical care, in a timely manner.  At the time of the 2008 report adult critical care services were provided in 37 hospitals (52 units) across the country, including in a number of the smaller hospitals where beds were described as critical care beds but in practice treated low volumes of critical care patients.  The report has informed the work of the HSE critical care clinical programme which was subsequently established. <\/p><p>  On behalf of HSE operations, the critical care programme completes an annual census to collate each hospital providers' critical care bed capacity and medical and nursing staffing establishment.  Based on the 2014 national census of critical care beds, there are 233 adult critical care beds in public hospitals.  The HSE has advised that while there has been a net reduction in the number of critical care beds nationally, the HSE and the Critical Care Programme are working to ensure more appropriate referral of patients requiring higher levels of critical care to major hub hospitals identified by the HSE as meeting a number of criteria in relation to activity volume and strategic importance for the future.  The HSE is focused on delivering improvements in the way that critical care is organised and delivered within the hospital group structure to ensure patients receive the same high quality of care no matter where they are treated.  There is now a more co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of critical care, within and across hospital groups, with a focus on small hospitals managing routine urgent or planned care locally and more complex critical care managed in the larger hub  hospitals where the relevant clinical critical care expertise can be provided. <\/p><p>  The further development of critical care facilities is being considered in the context of service planning process for  2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Palliative Care Facility","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01200"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[38713\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the palliative care unit in Waterford University Hospital; the timeframe for same; the progress to date; when he expects the unit will be operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospice Services","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[38714\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown, in tabular form, of the level of Health Service Executive funding received by each of the hospice groups nationally for each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[38715\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown, in tabular form, of the annual running costs for each of the hospice groups nationally for each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[38716\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown, in tabular form, of the level of Health Service Executive funding received by each of the hospice groups expressed as a percentage of the annual running costs for each of the hospice groups nationally for each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 to 148, inclusive, together.<br\/><br\/>As these are service matters they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[38743\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900052#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm that the ambulance service provided from Kilbarrack fire station will not be withdrawn; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>Ambulance services in the Dublin area are provided by Dublin Fire Brigade under an agreement between Dublin City Council and the HSE.

I have consulted with the Department of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the position is that having regard to this context there are no plans to implement the recommendations set out in the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body as they apply to any public servant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900055#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900055#WRO01000"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[38621\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900055#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost to the Exchequer that would be involved in reducing the minimum number of pupils required for a staffing allocation of two teachers in a school to 17.","asker":"1185","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[38622\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900055#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost to the Exchequer that would be involved in reducing the minimum number of pupils required for a staffing allocation of three teachers in a school to 54.","asker":"1185","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[38623\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900055#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost to the Exchequer that would be involved in reducing the minimum number of pupils required for a staffing allocation of four teachers in a school to 84.","asker":"1185","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 to 182, inclusive, together.<br\/><br\/>Teacher allocations to all schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.

This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;.<\/p><p>  Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented.<\/p><p>  Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<\/p><p>  The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have.  The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders.<\/p><p>  The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioral disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<\/p><p>  In considering how a social context profile might be developed for schools, the working group noted that the Department currently holds information which underpinned the development of the Developing Equality in Schools (DEIS) schools programme.  However, this information dates from 2005, and was not considered by the Working Group to be current enough to provide a social context component for any new SEN Resource Teacher\/Learning support allocation model.<\/p><p>  The group therefore recommended that a new social context schools survey should be conducted.  Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives.<\/p><p>  The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<\/p><p>  It was considered that the issuing of a new survey was a preferable option to using existing data from 2005, or data from limited sources that may not capture the full current complexity of a school's make up.<\/p><p>  Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.<\/p><p>  At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey.<\/p><p>  The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data.  Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<\/p><p>  Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire.  I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<\/p><p>  Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.<\/p><p>  I can confirm that my Department has received communications from a number of schools and bodies in relation to the survey, including the school and the organisation referred to by the Deputy in his question, and that my Department will respond to those bodies accordingly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900056#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":489,"content":"<p>Question No. 193 answered with Question No. 192.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":490,"content":"<p>Question No. 194 answered with Question No. 192.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Assistance Fund","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900057#WRQ00250"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[38667\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900057#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will ensure that funding for the student assistance fund is increased in the upcoming budget, as its reduction in recent years has had a detrimental effect on students.","asker":"1065","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>The Student Assistance Fund is a component of the Third Level Access Measure which is managed on behalf of my Department by the Higher Education Authority and comprises two sub-priorities: the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities.

The circular also clarifies circumstances when SNA support should be reduced or withdrawn, for example where care needs have diminished or where a child may have left a school. Children who require support of an SNA will continue to avail of such support.<br\/><br\/>There has also been no reduction to the overall number of SNA or resource teaching posts which may be allocated to schools. The number of SNA posts which may be allocated to schools increased from 10,575 posts to 10,965 posts for 2014.<br\/><br\/>Once SNAs have been allocated to schools, the deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of this Circular is not to reduce the number of SNA posts in schools, but clarifies and restates the purpose of the SNA scheme which is to provide schools with additional support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs. <br\/><br\/>In June 2011, the Department published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme. In May 2013, the NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.<br\/><br\/>Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<br\/><br\/>There have been no changes to the way in which Resource Teachers are allocated to schools.  The total number of Resource Teaching posts which the NCSE may allocate to schools to support children with special educational needs for the 2014\/15 school year is presently set at 6,225 WTE posts.<br\/><br\/>This is more posts than has ever previously been made available to the NCSE to allocate to schools and shows that there has not been a reduction to the overall number of posts being allocated to schools for resource teaching support.

The purpose of those standards is to ensure that providers have the capacity to provide quality programmes of education and training to their learners. <br\/><br\/>  Since its establishment, QQI has been rolling out its own policies and criteria across its range of functions and, in the final quarter of 2013, it published the policies required to allow new providers to gain access to its awards. In addition, QQI determined the fees associated with those policies, and those fees were consented to by the then Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In the further education and training sector, those fees amounted to &euro;5,000 for approval of quality assurance procedures, and &euro;2,000 or &euro;1,000 for validation of a programme of education and training, depending on the size of the award.

The criteria for the allocation of posts is published annually on the Department website.  Where staff are on career breaks, carer's leave, job sharing, extended sick leave, maternity and extended maternity leave the posts are filled by staff on fixed term contracts, until the post holder returns to his \/ her position. In the post primary sector it may transpire that schools are forced to employ more than one teacher on fixed term contracts to cover the subject combination of a teacher on a particular leave of absence.  <br\/><br\/>  There are also arrangements in place whereby schools can apply for temporary full and part-time resource posts to cover their NCSE approved allocation if such schools are unable to access resource hours through a network full time permanent resource posts in place. <br\/><br\/>  Where a fixed term contract is awarded to a teacher and the allocation continues to support the need for the teacher, after three years and subject to the terms of Department circulars, that person teacher will be offered a contract of indefinite duration in the school.  <br\/><br\/>  Special Needs Assistants are employed in schools to assist with the care needs of children.  Due to the nature of the work the allocation for SNAs will increase or decrease depending on the numbers of children requiring assistance in any school year.  SNAs are employed on the basis that they will continue to work in the school as long as the resource is required.  If there is no requirement for an SNA and the post becomes redundant, the SNA may opt to take a redundancy payment or remain on a panel for up to two years while seeking a further post as an SNA.<br\/><br\/>  At the end of the 2013\/14 school year there were 935 primary teachers and 2,618 post primary teachers on fixed term contracts.<br\/><br\/>  The Department does not have a direct role in the recruitment and employment of staff in the education and training board sector and, accordingly, information regarding the number of temporary contracts in place in the sector is not readily available.

This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as for child benefit, while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped. <br\/><br\/>In its determination, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months. The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package.

The test certificate issued is valid for 1 or 2 years (depending on the age of the car) from the date of registration in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In the UK passenger cars must undergo a roadworthiness test when they are three years old and annually thereafter.\u00a0 If an Irish car is imported into the UK it becomes subject to UK requirements and must undergo an MOT there if it is more than three years old, even if it holds a current NCT certificate. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900063#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport Provision","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900063#WRX01650"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[38698\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014100900063#WRX01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans for public transport in the Dublin area in the short to medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1006","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>The\u00a0National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for developing public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).<br\/><br\/>The NTA&rsquo;s Integrated Implementation Plan 2013-2018 sets out a programme of investment and development in the\u00a0GDA for the next five years based on the priorities and funding set out in the\u00a0 capital plan\u00a0to 2016 and\u00a0\u00a0on an indicative allocation for 2017 and 2018.\u00a0This plan will be updated when a revised capital plan is finalised.<br\/><br\/>My Department\u00a0currently provides in the region of &euro;150 million annually\u00a0 to the NTA to support public transport improvements in\u00a0the GDA.\u00a0 This funds light rail improvements,\u00a0 of which the current\u00a0 priority\u00a0is the\u00a0delivery of Luas Cross City,\u00a0\u00a0heavy rail enhancements such as the\u00a0 city centre re-signalling project, level crossing removals on the Maynooth line, automatic ticketing machines\u00a0and other \u00a0station improvements, purchase of replacement\u00a0 buses and the provision and upgrading of bus stops and bus shelters;\u00a0development of quality bus corridors, cycling routes\u00a0, pedestrian crossings, safety\u00a0improvements; and\u00a0\u00a0the continued development and rollout of a range of integration measures such as the <i>Leap Card ,<\/i>real time passenger information and journey planner.<br\/><br\/>Funding is also provided for ongoing research and planning\u00a0for future requirements.\u00a0This\u00a0 includes\u00a0planning for the\u00a0re-opening of the Phoenix Park Tunnel link,\u00a0for\u00a0design of a possible\u00a0Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Network and a review of existing large projects postponed in recent years.<br\/><br\/>These \u00a0reviews include\u00a0a\u00a0technical consultancy (<i>Fingal\/North Dublin Transport Study<\/i>) to assess the\u00a0rail transport requirements of the North Dublin\/Fingal corridor, extending from Finglas to Malahide and including Dublin Airport and Swords and\u00a0\u00a0the updating of the\u00a02010 DART\u00a0Underground business case.\u00a0The NTA advise that these\u00a0 will be available \u00a0early next year.\u00a0 In addition I expect to have a report and business case for\u00a0 the Swords\/Airport BRT proposal. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>I will then consider\u00a0the options for\u00a0addressing\u00a0key public transport deficits in the GDA having regard to the outcome of the reviews as regards costs and benefits, affordability, and funding options with a view to finalising a position\u00a0by mid-2015.<br\/><br\/>The\u00a0key priority\u00a0over the coming years is\u00a0to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards.

These have included the introduction and progress of the third Home Rule Bill in the Westminster parliament, the formation of Volunteer movements, and the outbreak of World War I. Economic and social issues were examined in 2013 on the Centenary of the 1913 Lockout along with the role of suffragettes.  This year has seen significant attention to the mobilisation in Ireland and across Europe for the First World War. In the coming year, alongside the continuing experience of World War I, this commemorative programme will address the cultural revival in Ireland, which reflected the strengthening sense of national identity and determination to achieve autonomous government.<\/p><p>  As part of the 2016 commemorations, arrangements have been made for a number of significant capital projects. These include the renovation of Kilmainham Courthouse to enhance the visitor experience at Kilmainham Gaol, the development of a permanent exhibition space and interpretative centre at the GPO and the development of visitor facilities at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc. The development of a Tenement Museum is moving ahead and I was also pleased to have been present last week at the announcement of the renovation works to take place at Richmond Barracks.

Six sites containing suitable breeding and foraging habitat for the Hen Harrier have now been designated as SPAs. Consented activities within these SPAs - such as wind-farm development and afforestation, for example - can only be undertaken in keeping with the provisions of Article 6 of the EU Habitats Directive, which require ecological assessment of the impact of such development by the consent authority involved. Where an adverse impact cannot be ruled out, the authority is prevented from granting consent, except in exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>  A failure by Ireland to adhere to these requirements could result in further infringement action and the imposition of fines, including daily fines, by the Court of Justice.
