Despite all the efforts by the Department and even the financial constraints put on the purchase of cigarettes more than 200 million packets were still sold in the country.  However, I refer to the fact that some 21 million packets are in illegal distribution.  Furthermore, we see the prevalence now of the illegal distribution of roll-up tobacco pouches.  It is a very serious problem.  The 6% reduction in the illegal sale of packets of cigarettes in the past seven years is welcome, but 21 million packets are in distribution.  That is a loss to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;170 million, which is significant, not only from the Revenue's point of view but also from the point of view of the Department of Health in terms of its pursuance to reduce smoking in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#B01400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>We will note that.

It was agreed to postpone this correspondence for consideration today.  This correspondence states:<\/p><blockquote>Many options to address the flooding in Cork have been considered by the Design Team and assessed by reference to a comprehensive suite of technical, social, environmental and economic criteria.  Arising from this detailed multi criteria analysis, a preferred option was identified and brought to exhibition.  The estimated cost of the proposed scheme is &euro;140 million based on 2017 construction costs including VAT.<br \/><br \/>As part of the statutory Exhibition process carried out between 12 December 2016 and 7 April 2017, over 1,000 submissions were received on the proposals.  The submissions are currently being considered before the scheme is advanced to formal Confirmation (i.e. Ministerial approval) stage. OPW is in discussions with Cork City Council on the main issues arising to identify potential changes to the Scheme as a result.  OPW is aware of alternative design ideas being put forward and all such proposals will be considered during this process.<\/blockquote><p>I propose that we ask the OPW to keep us informed of and up to date on each stage of this project as it progresses.  Deputy Catherine Murphy had requested this report, so I hope it is of some assistance to the people who raised the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#B01500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>There is big resistance to the particular solution proposed and the 1,000 submissions give some indication of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#C00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 624C, correspondence received from an individual on 19 June 2017.  This correspondence is addressed to the chief superintendent at the Bridewell Garda station and alleges treason by judges and contempt of the High Court by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.   It has been copied to us and we have not been asked to do anything.  We acknowledge that we have received it.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 625C, correspondence dated 20 June from an individual making an observation about the meeting on 20 June with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I propose we forward a copy of this to Dr. Richard Thorn, who is carrying out the review, subject to the correspondent's approval.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 627C, correspondence dated 22 June 2017 from the chairman of a company in the Czech Republic.  This correspondence alleges that NAMA failed in its duty to achieve the best achievable financial return for the State by dealing expeditiously with the Savarin loan portfolio owned by Welwyn in order to expedite the matter.  We received this complaint and wrote to NAMA, which has given us a detailed response, about it.  We sent it back to the company involved which is writing again to us.  We do not normally do this.  However, in order to be practical and expedite the matter on behalf of the correspondents, I propose that we refer this to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which is scheduled to meet representatives from NAMA on 13 July.  Those representatives are not scheduled to come before our committee for some time.  They will be before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in two weeks' time so we will ask the latter to follow up on this issue with them.  That is a practical way of moving matters on.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 629C and 635C are two items of correspondence from an individual - dated 23 June and 27 June, respectively - regarding the Courts Service spectrum growth fund.  Inquiries were previously made with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its response was forwarded to the individual, who was also advised that the matter will be discussed at the meeting on 13 July 2017 when the representatives from the Courts Service are due to attend.  We will be raising this issue publically and formally with the Courts Service on that date.  The individual has requested a meeting with the Chair and members of the committee in advance of the meeting on 13 July.  If such a meeting were to happen, it would, be definition, be informal in nature.  As we will be engaging with the Courts Service on 13 July, I propose that we raise the matter then.  I do not know if we will have an opportunity to meet the individual in the interim.  Perhaps members can do so in order that we might be fully up to date with the views of the people who are corresponding with us and thereby have a proper discussion on the matter at the public meeting with the Courts Service on 13 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>It would be quite useful to meet informally with this individual because there is quite a bit of information involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#C00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I know that this person has been in contact with Deputy Catherine Murphy and several other members of the committee.

As the Chairman mentioned, we opened our first EIB office in Ireland in Dublin last December.  I thank the Chairman for the introduction he gave Mr. Cormac Murphy, who is the head of our office in Dublin.  We have offices in most EU member states with a few remaining gaps.  Opening an office in Dublin was long overdue and Mr. Murphy's presence here will be very valuable to the bank.<\/p> <p>  As vice president of the European Investment Bank since September 2016, among my responsibilities is oversight of our operations in Ireland and some other EU countries.  The EIB was created under the Treaty of Rome.  We are a treaty-based EU institution.  We are the European Union's long-term lending institution, owned directly by the 28 EU member states.  That may be an issue we can come back to.  We are often known as the EU bank.  We are distinguished in that from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, and other international financial institutions, IFIs, by the fact that we are the only bank that is owned only by EU member states.  The EBRD has shareholders in the United States, Japan and outside Europe.  <\/p> <p>  Our mission is to use loans and other financial instruments, including equity investments, to finance long-term investment projects that support EU policy goals.  We are headquartered in Luxembourg.  As well as the bank, we are the majority owner of the European Investment Fund, EIF, which was created in 1992 to focus on financing Europe&rsquo;s small and medium-sized enterprises.  We are self-financing; we do not look for budget money from the EU budget every year.  We finance all our projects through the capital markets.  We are the largest international public bank in the world and the largest non-state borrower in the world.  Last year, we raised about &euro;65 billion on the capital markets and we loaned about &euro;83 billion.  That is about twice the size of the World Bank in terms of the overall volume of operations.  On average, we finance around 500 projects each year in over 160 countries.  By volume, the vast majority - about 90% - of our business is within the EU and 10% is outside of the European Union.  That proportion is increasing.  The activity is designed to support EU foreign policy goals.<\/p> <p>  Our ability to support the European economy was significantly enhanced in 2015 when the European Council and Parliament agreed on a new joint European Commission and EIB initiative, known as the investment plan for Europe or the Juncker plan, to kick start long-term investment in key areas.  The aim is to use guarantees of &euro;16 billion from the EU budget and &euro;5 billion of EIB&rsquo;s own capital to form this fund called the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI, which is designed to mobilise a total of &euro;315 billion of higher risk investments in transport, broadband, energy, innovation, renewable energy, energy efficiency and SME financing.  This was the mainstay initiative of the Juncker commission on the economy.  We are well over half way through the goal of financing &euro;315 billion in investment.  The latest estimate is that we have financed about &euro;180 billion of investments since the start of it.  We are very confident we will reach that target.  The European Council, Commission and Parliament are already negotiating the extension of this EFSI initiative from mid-2018 all the way to mid-2020.  <\/p> <p>  The EIB has been a long-term financing partner for Ireland and has provided nearly &euro;15.5 billion for investment since it joined the EU in 1973.  Our lending activities here significantly increased during the financial crisis with annual lending now representing nearly double the engagement since 2008.  As other banks were exiting Ireland during the financial crisis and deleveraging their Irish exposures, the EIB was significantly increasing its exposure to Ireland, consistent with the Government's policies and EU policy to support the Irish economy.  <\/p> <p>  In the past five years, EIB lending in Ireland totalled &euro;4.2 billion, supporting, among other projects, the motorway programme, Dublin Port expansion, Dublin Airport terminal 2, the Luas extension and university campus expansions.  We signed loans with every university in Ireland over this period.  These were the first borrowings taken up by the Irish university system.  We financed schools and primary care centres through regular Exchequer financing and PPPs, and social housing, at a time when other sources of financing for enterprise and infrastructure investment were being cut back significantly.<\/p> <p>  Before the banking crisis, EIB lending in Ireland averaged around &euro;400 million per year and this year we are in a position to provide more than &euro;1 billion depending on the level of demand.  We are subject to promoters seeking disbursement of cash.  We are not in control of how much we lend each year - the promoters are - but we are in a position to lend that figure.<\/p> <p>  The EIB is also diversifying the nature of its engagement.  Last year, we financed 13 initiatives across a spectrum of areas of different infrastructure classes and enterprise areas compared to just three in 2008.  Our relationship with Irish State partners, particularly the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, continues to strengthen.<\/p><p>During 2014, the EIB provided a &euro;400 million facility to the newly established Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland - representing 50% of the total initial funding - at extremely attractive conditions to kick-start increased lending to Irish SMEs.  More recently, the EIF, our subsidiary, and the SBCI signed the first competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, COSME, agreement in Ireland.  COSME is the European programme for SMEs.  This transaction, guaranteed by the EFSI initiative, has recently been extended and will allow the SBCI to support up to &euro;330 million of agriculture-related loans to up to 10,000 SMEs, primarily farmers, by commercial banks in Ireland over the next three years.  In addition, the EIF has supported a number of equity funds for high tech sectors, a &euro;20 million Business Angels co-investment instrument with Enterprise Ireland and a guarantee in favour of Microfinance Ireland issued under the EU programme for employment and social innovation, EaSI, to support very small businesses.<\/p><p> To further support Ireland's strong economic recovery, particularly in the context of the growing infrastructure bottlenecks here, as well as out of recognition that Ireland is uniquely exposed to the economic impact of Brexit, the EIB hopes to increase its level of support for Irish projects.  With this aim in mind, as well as opening a permanent office in Dublin last December, we established with the Irish Government an Ireland-EIB financing group.  The group, which was chaired initially by the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and which is now chaired by the current Minister, Deputy Donohoe, includes senior management from the EIB, led by the president and myself, as well as Government Ministers and senior officials from relevant Departments and agencies.  The first meeting of the group was held last December and the second meeting was held in Luxembourg last month, with the former and current Ministers present, to discuss progress and formulate further actions that will facilitate the EIB's engagement in Ireland, notably discussions on support to negate the potential negative impacts of Brexit for Irish enterprise.  To support the financing group, a number of thematic working groups have been established, covering: financing connectivity, including road, rail, air, ports, broadband and energy networks; financing social infrastructure, including housing, health and education; and financing enterprise, including venture capital, our support for the banks, agribusiness and so on.<\/p><p> Without prejudging the outcome of the detailed and constructive discussions currently taking place, areas where we have signalled the potential for greater EIB financing include: increased lending to the Irish sovereign for Exchequer capital projects to be identified in the revised capital programme; increased mobilisation of private finance, under public private partnerships, PPPs, and similar structures, for investment in roads, public transport, social housing and other areas, consistent with the Government&rsquo;s need to expand infrastructure investment while staying within the EU fiscal rules; direct lending support for the investment programmes of Irish semi-States such as the ESB, Ervia, the DAA and so on; increased direct investment in mid-sized Irish corporates, including through equity-type products; and credit guarantees to Irish commercial banks to increase their lending into key sectors, such as agribusiness, residential and business energy-saving projects and the SME sector, consistent with the banks&rsquo; own needs to preserve scarce capital while financing a growing economy and supporting those sectors particularly exposed to Brexit.  To have maximum effect, these initiatives will often combine EU and national budget resources, as well as EIB and SBCI funding and capital; and we have an appetite to increase the amount of project finance we will provide for the renewable energy sector in Ireland, including solar energy.<\/p><p> The Ireland-EIB financing group has committed to meet at least twice a year and the next meeting, planned for later this year in Dublin, will follow the review of the capital programme and will provide further clarity on priority projects across multiple sectors.<\/p><p> On that note, I will conclude my opening remarks.  Mr. Cormac Murphy and I will be happy to answer any questions members of the committee may wish to ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew McDowell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>A number of members have indicated their desire to contribute.

Capital investment was frequently the first area to be cut, including the human resource capacity to develop the pipeline of projects.  Ireland is a particularly acute case in that respect.  It is not unique but it is more evident in Ireland than in most other EU countries that, at local as well as national level, the capacity within individual agencies and Departments to develop pipeline projects was damaged.  It is not always just a case of fiscal resources and financing capacity.  Frequently, it is a case of the human resource capacity to produce a stronger pipeline of projects when the economy needs it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062900002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew McDowell"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>In his earlier life, was Mr. McDowell not involved in taking some of those decisions?

I do not believe anybody would claim things were perfect in terms of the decisions that had to be taken to restore the ability of the sovereign to raise its own financing again but, by and large, as we have seen, the country is growing again and the policies have resulted in growing employment levels and quite a strong economic recovery.  However, there is a huge challenge in repairing the damage that was done from the financial and fiscal crisis, of that there is no doubt, in terms of the State's capacity, in the context of both financial and human resources, to start investing heavily again.<\/p><p>We are eager to support this.  Infrastructure projects can be financed in different ways.  The traditional approach is sovereign borrowing to finance infrastructure through the public capital programme - the Exchequer finance capital programme - and we are happy to support the Government in doing this.  The Irish Government can borrow on the bond markets but we believe there is an advantage in the European Investment Bank, EIB, financing the programme as opposed to doing it through the bond markets, and for the following reasons.  As well as cheap financing, we bring technical capacity and advisory support, which can be of significant benefit.  Our financing costs are still less than those of the Irish Government, such that we still offer a financial advantage to Ireland when it comes to financing infrastructure as compared to NTMA bond market borrowing.  We are also very flexible in terms of the draw downs.  When the NTMA borrows on the bond markets, it has to take out a &euro;5 billion bond and if the State is not ready to spend the money, it has to park it in a bank account whereas we will disperse very flexibly only when the projects need the cash.  <\/p><p> On Deputy Broughan's second question, on top of traditional Exchequer borrowing, where states are under pressure under the fiscal rules, we can look at alternative structures, particularly public private partnerships. PPPs.  We would regard this as supplementary to a normal Exchequer capital programme.  It is not displacing it.  Public private partnerships offer an advantage in the sense that they transfer a lot of the risk for delivering construction on availability of infrastructure to the private sector, but the disadvantage is that the State has to pay the private sector for the cost of that risk such that the borrowing cost is slightly higher than it is when one borrows from the bond markets.  This reflects the fact that significant risk is being transferred to the private sector.  In the case of Ireland, that margin for the cost of public private partnerships over the cost of sovereign borrowing is as tight as anywhere in Europe.  Ireland is regarded as a very safe, competent location for investment in public private partnerships, largely as a result of the professionalism of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, in developing PPP projects.  This is an option for Ireland in terms of how to expand its infrastructure programme beyond what is possible under the fiscal rules.<\/p><p> Public private partnerships, PPPs, can be a contentious issue.  The devil is always in the detail and much is dependent on a project.  We would never advocate PPPs purely as a way of getting around the fiscal rules.  The model has to be suited to the project.  The fiscal flexibility from PPPs should be regarded as a secondary benefit.  The primary motivation should always be that the private sector has the capacity to manage these risks better than the public sector.  On occasion, we have had promoters from some European countries coming to us suggesting PPPs in certain areas of public investment but we have refused them on the basis that it would not make any sense to do a PPP in those areas because they represented poor value for money from the private sector.  In other areas where governments are financing projects through traditional Exchequer investment, we have suggested that they instead do them through PPPs because the projects were in areas the private sector could easily manage and they could get very good value for money.  It depends on individual projects.<\/p><p> In terms of motorways, we have done a lot of the motorways in Ireland through PPPs and they have all been very successful.  We have the appetite to do the remaining gaps in the motorway system through PPPs, if that is what the national authorities decide.  The advantage of this for Ireland if a public private partnership is available, which means the private sector is taking the risk around construction of the infrastructure but not in regard to the volume of traffic that uses it, is that there is no upfront cash outlays by the State.  All the upfront cash outlays come from the private sector, with the State paying a unitary payment over the lifetime of the asset, usually 25 or 30 years.  It spreads out the cost of the asset over its lifetime as opposed to all of the pressure coming upfront.  There can be other forms of PPPs where there is no impact on the State's finances because the private promoters are not only taking the availability risk, but they are also taking the traffic risk.  In other words, the motorway is tolled and the private sector can generate enough revenue from the tolling to pay for the infrastructure.  We can help in those projects as well by essentially making them safer for private sector investors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062900002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew McDowell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDowell and Mr. Murphy for being here today.

Last year, we jointly published with EUROSTAT a guide for national authorities on how to design PPPs in a way that is consistent with the statistical classification rules of EUROSTAT.

It may be that the EIB could have a role.  Further flexibility for projects co-financed by the EIB would provide sufficient reassurance to all EU and eurozone member states that these were high quality projects.  We do not just finance projects, we have also have to put them through a very intensive environmental, social and economic appraisal to make sure that they actually make sense.  The degree of confidence that our shareholders, the 28 member states, have in the EIB appraisal process may make it easier to provide some additional flexibility to co-financed infrastructure projects.  This will, however, ultimately be a matter for the Commission and the member states to decide.  <\/p><p> There may well be further debate on the fiscal rules.  The Commission introduced a particular investment clause in the Stability and Growth Pact two years ago.  This allows for further investment levels but only in very tightly defined circumstances - countries have to be in recession and the project has to be of common interest at European level.  This is so rigidly defined, in fact, that there has been almost no further investment.  Only one single project has got through this additional flexibility introduced by the Commission.  The Commission did, however, promise a review of these investment laws by the middle of next year.  Now is certainly a good time to look at ideas of how to perhaps expand the flexibility of this investment clause for countries like Ireland with big investment requirements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062900002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew McDowell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>With regard to the Juncker plan, Mr. McDowell mentioned that &euro;180 billion of funding has been facilitated by the EIB.

It is true that the cost of credit is higher from Irish banks than in most other eurozone countries.  Where the funding has been based, however, on an EIB group guarantee, it is significantly cheaper.  Last December, for example, we did a COSME transaction where we provided with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland an 18% guarantee to the banks on their lending into the agribusiness sector.  We expect there to be up to 10,000 beneficiaries of that &euro;350 million of lending.  The interest rate on those loans was less than 3%, which was quite exceptional.  The initial tranche of that, in fact, which came to approximately &euro;100 million, was drawn down within about eight weeks.  That was without collateral.<\/p> <p>  There is an argument that the banks are not lending and that there is not enough credit demand in the Irish economy.  What we have certainly noticed with this transaction, however, is that when one gets the conditions and the interest rate right and removes the collateral requirements there is certainly a lot of credit demand in the Irish economy.

The national economic dialogue is running at the same time as this committee and I would just like it put on the record that this is awkward.  I was briefly there this morning but was not able to attend properly because of having this meeting here.  Perhaps other Deputies cannot be here because they are there.  I would just like to flag this as an issue to be looked at.  I stated at the national economic dialogue that we need to reconsider how we engage with this process because they are interested in the budgetary oversight process, just as we obviously are too.  I am sure that Mr. McDowell is familiar from his previous role with that whole world and how we get the partnership approach working properly.<\/p> <p>  It is very good to have Mr. McDowell's presentation and I have a few questions.  With regard to flexibility in the fiscal rules, I vaguely recall that when the Juncker investment fund was set up there was a commitment that anyone investing into it could amend their fiscal rules.  There was a caveat and it was difficult because there was no guarantee of being able to invest into a fund.  Did that help the EIB's lending back out of it?   I mention this as one interesting example.<\/p> <p>  I would also appreciate clarification on the figure of how much we have now managed to get out of Juncker fund, the EFSI.  Of the &euro;1 billion available to the EIB, Mr. McDowell must also have a rough projection of what sort of lending and what sort of take-up to expect this year.  He said that the EIB had &euro;1 billion available to lend but I imagine that that depends on the presence of private sector counter-parties to take it up.  What is the projected take-up for this year?<\/p> <p>  Mr. McDowell also mentioned that the EFSI is about to be expanded up to about &euro;500 billion.  My understanding is that there are certain conditions with that.  Am I right in saying that 40% of the lending has to go to low carbon energy or investments?  I would be interested to know what the conditions are for additional lending.  My understanding is that there are new conditions.  <\/p> <p>  On the same theme, how does the EIB look at assessing different projects?  Mr. McDowell mentioned, for example, that it was doing a lot of work on PPP motorways.  I know that Tom Parlon was licking his lips at this yesterday and his members have done very well out of construction projects.  IBEC was also out yesterday with a massive construction plan for the country involving motorways everywhere.  It seems that this does very well for its members too.  For the Irish public, however, how do we assess these projects?  They sail through every Department of Finance cost-benefit analysis.  There is to my mind an incredibly narrow set of criteria around time saved over a section of motorway and so forth and there seems to be no calculation of the environmental effects or the fact those time savings do not accrue in the end because of the M50 being so clogged.  There does not seem to be any assessment of alternative investments such as public transport, for example.  There are benefits from such alternatives.  People could be working while sitting on the train, for example.  Is Mr. McDowell satisfied with the cost-benefit economic analysis approach?  I ask this particularly in light of what I said earlier on, where on the one hand the Commission is saying that it wants everything to be low carbon and on the other hand a huge amount of the lending from the EIB is for motorways and the like.  That is what we build in this country.  When we say infrastructure we mean motorways and we want as many of them as we can get.  Is Mr. McDowell satisfied with the multi-criteria economic cost-benefit analysis we are doing on these projects?  From the analysis carried out, either by the Department of Finance or whoever else is making the call, it seems we can only build motorways and cannot do anything else.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062900002#F00800","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ryan for the questions.

A trilogue is taking place between the European Parliament, Council and Commission on the parameters regarding the extension of EFSI and the new targets to be included therein.  There is a proposal from the European Parliament to require that 40% of financing under EFSI 2.0 would go to climate action projects.  There is recognition and agreement that the denominator for that would be all EFSI lending outside of SMEs.  If one is lending to small and medium enterprises, it is very difficult to count how much of that goes towards climate action initiatives.  One does not want a trade-off between lending to SMEs and lending to climate action.  There is a consensus that 40% of financing going to climate action projects could work but only if it excludes EFSI lending to SMEs.  Ultimately, that will be a matter for the negotiators.

The Luas project we are financing is climate action, while the Dublin Port project has a significant climate action component.  The national broadband plan that we will be financing subject to the finalisation of the tender process is 100% climate action, as is the social housing programme because of the energy efficiency requirements it includes.  I can revert to the Deputy with the exact percentage but I would not be surprised if it is very close to the 40% figure.  A significant proportion of our lending in Ireland is for climate action projects.<\/p> <p>  On the fiscal rules in EFSI, the Deputy is correct that there is a mention in the investment clause of the Stability and Growth Pact that national contributions to EFSI projects will be potentially disregarded.  The difficulty with that in operation is that EFSI projects are high-risk projects.  When we do projects under the Juncker plan they tend to be high-risk private sector projects because that was the market gap identified.  Sovereign-backed infrastructure projects are not high-risk projects and therefore national co-financing of infrastructure tends not to count towards EFSI.  This particular mention of EFSI in the Stability and Growth pact does not make much sense to us.  It would make more sense to provide more flexible treatment of EIB finance projects more generally, rather than EFSI projects, as that would include a broader category of investments that the EIB makes, including lower-risk investments in infrastructure.

In terms of aggregated solar power, the EIB is not going to put a panel on my roof but perhaps if there were 10,000 people who sought such investments and an aggregator to act as a counter-party to EIB lending in that regard, there would be scope for EIB lending.  It would be private sector and it is not high risk but it is not a State infrastructure regulated asset.  Other projects we need to do on the same basis are deep retrofit and the rolling out of heat pumps, as are the tens of thousands of charging points we will need.  Might projects of that sort qualify, being aggregated, non-high risk but not regulated State infrastructure?

We are very interested in solar energy.  We have financed about 70% of all offshore wind projects in Europe and are the bank of choice for promoters in that area.  We are doing huge amounts of solar energy projects now, including in some parts of northern Europe.  Obviously, the biggest projects we are doing are in north Africa and southern Europe but it is making increasing economic sense, even without subvention, in northern Europe.  We think solar energy will transform the energy industry over the next five to ten years and it raises all sorts of questions for other forms of power, the economics of distribution networks and so on.  We are very excited about the possibilities and are one of the biggest financiers globally of solar energy projects.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Broughan's question regarding social housing, we do a significant amount of financing of social housing in Ireland.  We have lent about &euro;350 million to the Housing Finance Agency in two transactions over the past three years and that is on balance sheet and, therefore, Government borrowing.  The Housing Finance Agency likes to borrow from the EIB because we are cheaper than the NTMA and very flexible on drawdowns.  There is a significant energy efficiency component in that lending which makes it very attractive for us in terms of our targets.  We are also doing the first social housing PPP in Europe in Ireland.  This is the first time we have done a PPP for social housing and we are at a very advanced stage with the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, in contracting for three different bundles of social housing in Dublin, Cork and another urban area yet to be decided upon.  That is an interesting transaction from an Irish perspective because it allows the Government to pay for those assets over their lifetime, as opposed to having to pay for them all over the next two to three years when they have a 30-year lifespan.<\/p> <p>  The other area of social housing in which we invest heavily in other parts of Europe but is more difficult in Ireland is through funds.

In fact, there are a lot of areas where we finance things, for example the latest developments in radar technology, with civilian and military applications.  That is okay.  It is consistent with our eligibility criteria and it is okay for our investors.  As part of its security and defence discussion, the European Council has asked us to look at how to lend more and invest more in research and development in the defence industry generally.  Our lawyers are having a good look at this and it is the subject of intense debate among our board of directors on how to interpret the particular request from the European Council and on the implications for the bank and its funding.

It is not an area we have targeted in the past.  If there is a desire for the EIB to play a greater role in European security, we could lend more to dual use technologies in a way that is consistent with the ethical requirements of our investor base.  We raise approximately &euro;65 billion a year on capital markets.  I cannot give the committee an exact percentage on the bonds coming from institutional investors with specific ethical rules but I would say it is a very significant proportion.   We had the green bond programme.  We pioneered the development of the idea of green bonds, of which we are the largest issuer in the world.  The buyers of green bonds would have very clear rules that we cannot finance armaments.

In other cases, we are financing projects in the private sector that have to wash their own faces directly.  They have to generate enough cash to repay the debt.  That is the credit side.

The position of the European Union as expressed in the Commission's negotiating guidelines is that the UK will be repaid its paid-in share capital but only over the lifetime of the obligations that the bank has incurred using that share capital.  Basically, the bank uses the share capital of every member state to underpin its borrowings and we have outstanding bond liabilities of approximately &euro;480 billion, which will mature over 30 to 35 years.  Every country's share capital underpins that.  It is the position of the European that the UK will be entitled to get that money back but only as those obligations of the bank expire over a long period.

The bank will have an issue to deal with in terms of the statutory limits imposed on the bank regarding how much it can lend as against the amount of capital it has.  We are in discussions with the 27 remaining shareholders about ensuring that Britain's exit does not damage the bank's ability to do its job in those 27 member states.  As the members can imagine, we will start getting more questions from rating agencies on our AAA rating and institutional investors about the extent to which Brexit is going to affect the bank's capital strength.  We certainly feel it would be a good idea for the other 27 member states, even before agreeing the details of how they ensure the bank's capital structure remains strong, to articulate a statement of support for the EIB that Brexit will not be allowed to damage the bank's ability to do its job in the other 27 member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017062900002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew McDowell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The key matter is the capitalisation.

Amendment No. 2 makes an addition to the definition of the word \"consumer\" to include employees or former employees who benefit from an income continuance plan.  After part (c) of the definition of consumer in page 9, the amendment proposes to add \"(d) an actual or potential beneficiary of an income continuance plan;\".<\/p> <p>  In the Government's Bill, published on 10 May 2017, a \"consumer\" in respect of a financial service was defined in section 2 as being, in general terms, individuals, small businesses, charities, clubs and so on of financial services.  The definition seeks to encompass as many financial services as possible.  During the engagement on the drafting of Bill, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman made us aware of the unusual case of income continuance plans or ICPs, which are also known as permanent health insurance plans.  In an ICP, the employee is a third party and the contract exists between the employer who takes out the group scheme for the employees and the insurer.  If an employee has an issue with non-payment of a benefit to which he or she may be entitled, he or she is currently excluded from the Pensions Ombudsman's remit because he or she is not a party to the contract in respect of the income continuance plan.  The amendment seeks to address this lacuna in law which prevents a third party from taking a case in such circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The overarching aim of the legislation is to strengthen consumer protection and ensure consumers are not excluded from seeking appropriate and fair resolution and redress.  With this in mind, the amendment to extend the definition of \"consumer\" to include those who may benefit from income continuance plans is important.<\/p> <p>  Deputies may recall that in the Bill, as published, the Department sought to include income continuance plans in the definition of \"long-term financial service\" by the use of the words \"and not subject to [...] a right to unilateral cancellation by either party\".  On reflection, however, this group of amendments to the definition of the term \"consumer\" is the better way to accommodate these ICP cases.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#B00700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I have no issue with amendment No. 1, which is technical in nature.  I had intended to seek clarification in respect of amendments Nos. 2 and 3, which relate to income continuance plans, but the Minister of State addressed the issue.  On amendment No. 4, we discussed this issue when debating my legislation and I am glad the Government has removed from the draft Bill the provision which would mean that where a contract was unilaterally cancelled, it would not be considered a long-term financial service.  While this move is welcome, an issue remains in respect of people who will not be able to avail of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman because their contracts are considered not to fall within the six-year rule, even though the contract has continued for longer than six year.  I refer, for example, to insurance contracts that are defined in my legislation as contracts that have been consecutive for more than five years.  A legal issue arises regarding whether an insurance contract which was entered into and renewed annually for a long period is legally treated as a single contract of consecutive terms.  In other words, a contract renewed annually for ten years should be considered a long-term contract, rather than a one-year contract entered into when it was renewed in the previous year.  If the latter were the case, the product would fall outside the scope of the Financial Services Ombudsman.<\/p> <p>  This argument has been thrashed out and the Minister of State and I will not see eye to eye on it.  While I will not oppose the Government's amendment, I reiterate that while we are making significant strides in providing access to the Financial Services Ombudsman, access is also being restricted in a way that it should not have been.  I ask the Minister of State to address the point I raise regarding a financial services contract, such as an insurance contract, that has been renewed annually for ten years.  Can such a contract be legally defined as a single contract of consecutive terms, which would mean it was entered into ten years ago, or is it a new contract that is considered to have been entered into each year?  If the starting point is considered to be the previous year rather than ten years previously, under the scope of the Bill, the holder of the contract will have no recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman outside of the time limits that already exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#B00800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>As there has been no meeting of minds on this point, it may be helpful to the Deputy to read my briefing note.   The definition of the term \"long-term financial service\" has been considered in great detail during the passage of this Bill and Deputy Pearse Doherty's Private Members' Bill through the Houses.  As the time limit is one of the biggest changes for consumers in the Bill, it was paramount that an effective definition was constructed.  I am pleased to note that the Department listened carefully to the contributions made by Deputies during the various Stages of both Bills and extensively engaged with the ombudsman, the Central Bank of Ireland and Office of Parliamentary Counsel on this drafting issue in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>  While we may not achieve a meeting of minds on the definition, the Department believes it has got the definition in the section broadly correct.  Deputy Doherty's argument is essentially that an annualised insurance contract entered into a decade previously and renewed annually with the same company merits being treated as a long-term financial product.  The Department does not agree with this view.  Some concern was expressed that if a company attempted to insert some form of break in a long-term plan, the product would no longer be defined as a long-term financial service.  <\/p> <p>  A great deal of work has been done on this complex issue.  Following consultations with the entities to which I referred, the Department believes it has got the definition broadly correct.  The definition set out in amendment No. 4 in general terms encompasses all financial products and services of a fixed term of five years and one month or more, such as mortgages, payment protection in connection with a long-term service, long-term loans and life assurance to pay annuities on human life.  The definition of the term \"life assurance\" comes from the definition of that term on the Statute Book and also includes contracts of insurance to provide a sum on marriage or on the birth of a child, life assurance linked to investment funds, permanent health insurance, also known as income continuance plans, a \"tontine\", as it is known, where capital is paid into a common pool and each investor receives dividends until his or her death, and capital redemption products.  Those are the areas that we believe are best served by this legislation.<\/p> <p>  The revised wording clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt, that a range of policies or services which are short-term financial services, for example, house and travel insurance, are not included in the definition of long-term financial services.  There is no intention to change the meaning of the definition the Minister for Finance set out at various stages.<\/p><p>However, the drafting has now improved the wording for the avoidance of doubt and set out anti-avoidance type wording to prevent a provider from introducing a sham annual renewal process to avoid falling within the definition of long-term financial service.  The Government rationale for excluding annual policies from the definition of long-term financial services and concern to avoid passing extra cost to consumers is well set out during the various Stages of these Bills.  In essence, insurance companies would have to be mindful of the possibility of claims being taken in a longer timeframe for these products and would accordingly pass the extra costs onto consumers.  Additionally they could perhaps seek to refuse to cover customers after a five year period or increase the annual premiums substantially after a five year period to deter them from becoming a long-term product, which would include customers on the current definition in the Private Members Bill.  This would have a negative impact on customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#B00900","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>From a consumer point of view, this is the centrepiece of the Bill.  There has been a political consensus for some time that the six year rule needs to change.  I broadly welcome the definition that has been brought forward.  I understand Deputy Doherty's point.  It is nuanced but important.  My instinctive reaction is that a product that is subject to an annual renewal is not a long-term financial product.  For instance, if one took out their house insurance policy in 2010, and one is still with the same firm in 2016 and renews it again, if an issue arises over that policy in the calendar year 2016, then the baseline for invoking the complaints procedure kicks in from 2016 if it relates to an issue in 2016 and the policy the person renewed for 2016.  The Minister of State might give an assurance that the Department has raised that issue, having considered it, taken a view on the matter and raised it with the appropriate bodies.  My instinct is that if it is subject to annual review, that it is not a long-term product.  I welcome that the Government has removed the revocation clause whereby a product could be revoked, that it would not then qualify as a long-term product.  I raised that issue on Second Stage.  I am glad that it has been removed.  Having the six year rule amended, particularly in respect of long-term products, and bringing in the three year provision for when someone knew or ought to have known, is the big win in the legislation.  It is important that we get the finer details right but I am satisfied with the definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#C00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Doherty wish to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#C00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Yes, I do.

First, whatever we agree at this committee, I will table an amendment to my own legislation in the Seanad to replicate the provisions.  I did not propose an amendment to this section because I knew on Committee Stage that we would not have a meeting of minds.  At this stage, I am looking for reassurances.  There are probably two assurances that are required.  The first is that when this legislation passes into law, that after an appropriate period of time, possibly 12 months, we would ask the Financial Services Ombudsman to report to this committee whether it has seen any issues or people being blocked as a result of this definition and the fact that the annual renewable contracts were not included in it.  That would be helpful.  Second, on clarification on the legal status of an annually renewable contract; is it deemed as a single contract of consecutive terms, which I understand has been argued in legal cases before the courts, that is that someone took out their home insurance policy in 2004, and not 2016 when they renewed it?  Therefore, if there was an issue in 2016, they could potentially be barred from access to justice or in this case to the FSO, because of that definition.

As the Deputy will know, the courts have an obligation to hear and view the debates.  We are having the debate.  That is the interpretation as we see it, and that is also Deputy McGrath's interpretation.  If a case goes before the courts, we have outlined the legislation and the spirit of the legislation to do what we want it to do.  It is really a matter for the courts.  We have pitched it in the way that we feel it should be.  Deputy McGrath has articulated that well.  I understand his outline of it as, I am sure, does Deputy Doherty.

As a result of the sometimes very technical financial products dealt with, expertise would be required from outside the organisation and there is a requirement to have access to justice in a timely manner.  I am concerned in regard to the independence of this office if the appointment of consultants is to require the prior approval of the Minister, which is not currently the situation.  My political instinct is that this is where it should rest but I must also question why it is happening now and whether there has been a problem in the past.  Has the Financial Services Ombudsman previously appointed consultants whose fees were excessive, thus causing a drain on the Exchequer?  Why are we tinkering with the independence of an office which should be independent?  The Minister of State discussed how he would act in the interests of the consumer at all times.  While one would hope for that to be the case, the Minister must also weigh up not only the interests of the consumer but the interests of the economy, financial services and so on.  There are many Members of the Oireachtas and far more people in wider society who would argue that Ministers for Finance in different Governments did not act in the interests of consumers.  I am not referring to the Minister for State, Deputy D'Arcy, in this regard.  This is an independent office and it sets alarm bells ringing when I perceive that there is a kind of power grab involving the Minister.  We have dealt with the issue of regulations such that the council will no longer have authority to set caps on the maximum or minimum payouts or whatever regulations it wants to introduce.  There is now this issue in terms of the appointment of external consultants, which, as all members know, will be necessary in some of these cases because of the complexity of financial products that are sometimes dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#F00800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":290,"content":"<p>There is no power grab.  I assume the Deputy's rationale for the amendment, as he outlined, relates to the efficient functioning of the ombudsman's office.  His concern may be that the function of the office may be impacted upon by the requirement to obtain ministerial approval before engaging consultants and advisers.  However, that is not the case.  It is important to note that because voted funds are used by the office, the relevant provision in the Bills is essential and that is why I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  The premise of the section is that the financial service and pensions ombudsman, as an entity partly funded by the taxpayer and under the aegis of the Department of Finance, should seek the approval of the Minister for Finance before spending on a consultant or adviser who may be tasked with carrying out a review of the office, for example.  The provision in the Bill is a standard requirement for public bodies in receipt of public taxpayers' funds.  Recent legislation in respect of other public bodies, such as the Tax Appeals Commission and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, contains similar requirements to obtain ministerial approval before the expenditure of voted funds.<\/p> <p>  This section of the Bill on consultants and advisers came from section 133 of the Pensions Act 1990, with some drafting updates from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  As the Pensions Ombudsman was funded by the Exchequer, it was subject to more stringent requirements than the Financial Service Ombudsman.  In merging the two bodies - and in view the fact that the new body will have Exchequer funding - this accountability for the use of public funds is essential as it follows best practice.  This provision was not an impediment to the functioning of the Pensions Ombudsman in office, nor did it negatively interfere with the independence of the Pensions Ombudsman.  The Deputy is aware that consultant fees are a sensitive topic and are frequently subject to analysis and parliamentary questions.  It is not the intention that the ombudsman should seek consent before hiring temporary front-line workers or support staff such those necessary to provide payroll, audit or IT services.  Section 15(3) of the Bill outlines that persons may be appointed to the office as consultants or advisers or on a contract for services or on a permanent, temporary or part-time basis.  Thus, there are many staffing options available to the ombudsman.  For the reasons I have just listed, I cannot accept Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#F00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>As I said, my political instinct is that this is the right approach but there is an onus on us to question why it is happening.  I may be wrong but do hospitals and the HSE have to receive ministerial approval before appointing or seeking information from consultants or advisers?  I imagine not but perhaps that is the case.  The Minister of State is right that the issue of consultants is a red-hot topic and I have put down many parliamentary questions regarding both consultants and advisers.  I am not sure whether this section covers obtaining legal advice and so on.  The Minister of State says that section 15(3) allows for the ombudsman to appoint consultants and advisers but only in accordance with section 16.  Therefore, while the power is there to do so, ministerial approval is first required.  As I said, my political instinct is that this is democratic accountability but I am concerned whether the office or offices raised any concern with regard to how this would play out in practice.  Are there many appointments or advice sought from the Financial Services Ombudsman currently?  My concern is from the consumer's point of view in terms of access to timely judgments by the office.  Will the Financial Services Ombudsman or the new office will require a ministerial signature for every type of external advice it requires?  The Minister of State says this is standard practice.

The intention behind this group of amendments is amending the Government Bill to align it with the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, as passed by the D&aacute;il, and the Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC's, recommendation to bring more transparency and clarity to consumers about the labelling of decisions the ombudsman makes after completing an investigation in relation to a consumer complaint.  In the existing Central Bank Act 1997, legislation on the ombudsman, and the published Government Bill, section 60, on completing an investigation the ombudsman must make a decision in writing that the complaint is substantiated, not substantiated or partly substantiated.  My amendments on this issue, as well as those of Deputy Pearse Doherty, aim to change the categories to four more precise categories of outcomes.  The categories of decisions are referred to in several sections in the Bill, hence the number of amendments.  Section 60 of the Bill sets out four categories of decisions that can be made by the ombudsman on conclusion of his or her investigation of a complaint.  Currently the possible decisions are limited to: &quot;substantiated&quot;, &quot;not substantiated&quot; and &quot;partially substantiated&quot;.  The aim of the Minister for Finance's amendments in this group of amendments is to allow for a revised categorisation of decisions of: &quot;upheld&quot;, &quot;substantially upheld&quot;, &quot;substantially rejected&quot; or &quot;rejected&quot;.  These four categories are in line with Deputy Pearse Doherty's categories of decisions as set out in his Private Member's Bill as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and I thank him for proposing this change.<\/p><p> A change in the categories of decisions, from three to four, allows for increased transparency and better reporting regarding the ombudsman's investigation of complaints.  This is a reasonable update and modernisation of the current rules which will bring more clarity to consumers.  As I mentioned in the Seanad last week, this change is a good outcome for both the ombudsman&rsquo;s process and consumers, and will be in addition to the publication of decisions in section 62 of the Government&rsquo;s Bill.  There are consequential amendments to update and restate the existing legislation with the updated categories of findings.  However, I now see that Deputy Pearse Doherty seeks to improve on his four new categories of decisions.  The proposed new categories set out in this amendment are upheld, substantially upheld, partially upheld - which is new - and rejected.  Deputy Doherty wants to revise the third category from substantially rejected to partially upheld.  I can understand the principle of what he is trying to achieve but there may be drafting issues with his amendments, and I suggest that we return to this topic for report stage. <\/p><p> I can set out the purpose of each amendment in this group now if necessary, but I am withdrawing my amendments and I think the Deputy may take the opportunity to withdraw his amendments on the basis that we return to this on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#G02300","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>The amendments I have tabled are Nos. 7, 9, 11, 18, 22 and 27.

The correct cross reference within section 50(1) should therefore be section 44(2)(a)(i).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#H02800","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Section 50, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>SECTION 51<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 15 has already been discussed with amendment No. 14.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#J00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p><blockquote>In page 42, line 13, to delete &ldquo;<i>subsection (2)<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>subsections (1) <\/i>and <i>(2)<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#J00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Section 51, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Sections 52 to 55, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>SECTION 56<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 16 has already been discussed with amendment No. 6.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#J00900","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<\/p><blockquote>In page 45, line 28, to delete &ldquo;substantiated&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;upheld&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017062900002#J01000","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Section 56, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Section 57 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498726800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>SECTION 58<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 17:<\/p><blockquote>In page 46, lines 4 and 5, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;The&rdquo; in line 4 down to and including line 5 and substitute the following:&ldquo;On receiving a complaint, the Financial Services Ombudsman shall, as far as possible, try to resolve the complaint by mediation.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This amendment proposes the deletion of section 58(1), the first subsection in the mediation clause, which replaces the existing legislative provisions that establish a Financial Services Ombudsman.  It is my view that section 58(1) is weaker than the original provisions.  Section 58(1) reads: &quot;The Ombudsman may, as part of an investigation, in circumstances where he or she deems it appropriate, try to resolve a complaint by mediation.&quot;  My amendment would delete that subsection and re-establish the existing wording from the legislation establishing the Financial Services Ombudsman, to read: &ldquo;On receiving a complaint, the Financial Services Ombudsman shall, as far as possible, try to resolve the complaint by mediation.&rdquo;<\/p><p>As we discussed earlier, two pieces of legislation on this matter are currently going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is hoped that my own Bill will go before the Seanad next week.  We have been drafting amendments for the Seanad and in doing so, found the wording that is proposed under this amendment.  It is the wrong reference because, obviously, the Financial Services Ombudsman's office would no longer exist.  We did try to engage with the Bills Office but the officials there would not allow us to amend the amendment.  I will therefore be withdrawing amendment No. 17.  However, I believe the substantive point stands, namely, that we should revert back to the existing provision under subsection 58(1).<\/p><p>The other subsections of section 58 are very positive and I commend the Government on them.  It was an issue that I raised in my own draft legislation, published in 2014, which was intended to compel the financial institutions to engage in mediation or give valid reasons as to why they would not do so.  I welcome the fact that there is more voluntary mediation.  Although it may not always be the case, there are institutions that would reject the idea of mediation.  Any court would look at the Bill before us and ask why the Legislature is now weakening the provision by using the word &quot;may&quot; instead of &quot;shall&quot;.  The powers provided here do allow the ombudsman to carry out mediation as part of an investigation.  However, in any court case, these discussions and the intention behind the wording would be teased out and, as part of that process, the Judiciary would compare the new wording with the one it replaced.  <\/p><p>I intend to withdraw the amendment.  I have engaged with the officials and hope to come up with a resolution shortly.  I know the intention of the Minister and the Government is that there would be no weakening of the provisions.

While I am not saying that by weakening it, we improve it, our logic is that this is the direction in which we should go.  To give Deputy Doherty some of the information, under the previous legislation about 1% of complaints concluded via the mediation process.  My note states that 2,378 were resolved through mediation between 1 February and the end of 2016, following our tweaking of the existing provisions.  That is about 60%, which is a big improvement.  The concern is that, potentially, the retention of \"shall\" would deter or prevent people from attempting to conclude this via an informal process prior to mediation.  Quite a few are concluded informally without going down the route of the mediation process.<\/p> <p>  That is our thinking.  I appreciate that the Deputy is withdrawing the amendment.  If we can have a conversation between the officials, Deputy Doherty and myself, we might come to a position with which we are satisfied.  There will certainly be no weakening of the provisions.

That provision has not been a hindrance at this point.  The issue is that when the ombudsman engages with financial institutions, not every financial institution will engage in mediation.  It is their right not to engage in mediation.  Because of the word \"shall\", the ombudsman's office can say that under law, it has to engage.  That argument will be gone as mediation will be just another way of resolving the complaint and will no longer be the way in which they should try to resolve the complaint.<\/p> <p>  I think we are on the same page in terms of what we are trying to achieve here.

I am relieved we will not take Report Stage in advance of the recess because, in some ways, it is a little unusual that the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was undertaken by the health committee and not this committee.  We therefore find ourselves having to have a detailed discussion about a very important Bill on Committee Stage, so I ask for a little forbearance in dealing with some of these issues because they are important and we will, sadly, have to spend some time teasing them out on this Stage.<\/p><p>This group of amendments relates to the periodic payment order.  We raised on Second Stage the fact that if we do not link the periodic payment orders, PPOs, to the actual cost of health care, we run the very real risk of people who have been catastrophically injured by our health service not receiving the funds they need for their care through their final days.  The original recommendation regarding indexation of PPOs, which was unanimously endorsed by the judicial working group on medical negligence, was that an earnings and cost-related index would be introduced to act as a guide for the periodic payment orders.  Sadly, the Bill before us does not do this.  It gives us a harmonised index of consumer prices, as published by the Central Statistics Office, with no special provision for an index of care costs.  Therefore, what we see in the Bill is the exact opposite of what was unanimously recommended by the judicial working group, which is unfortunate.<\/p><p> The working group also pointed out that the Department of Finance, in its paper on periodic payment orders indexation, noted that an index based purely on either the CPI or the harmonised index of consumer prices would not directly take account of wages, and that this was critical in dealing with situations where people's after care was going to be factored on.  The paper noted that over the longer term, the index should give the best outcome for recipients.  That is what we are arguing for here.  With our amendment, we are trying to find a middle ground between the various recommendations.  The CSO's quarterly earnings survey would not take into account changes in the cost of medical devices or assistive technologies, medical treatment and so on and would not be enough to properly index PPOs in our opinion.  We are proposing that within a year of enactment of this section, the Minister would publish or cause to be published an index that tracks the following: earnings in the nursing and care sectors and such other sectors as appear to the Minister to be relevant to the indexation of PPOs; the cost of medical treatment in this jurisdiction; the cost of mechanical or other health aids and appliances in this jurisdiction; and such other costs as appear that Minister might think would be relevant.  That index shall be used along with the HICP to calculate the rate of PPOs.  The extra year has been provided for to allow things to bed in and give some idea of the types of fluctuation, if any, that might occur in the costs that are being measured. <\/p><p> I appreciate that the Bill does provide for a review of the use of the HICP after five years, and for the drawing up of a more relevant index at that time if the Minister so wishes.  The Bill as it currently stands, however, is too wide open in that regard.  There is no obligation for such a review to take place or for a change to take place following a review.  It is too big a risk.  Five years is way too long.  After the five years, the review could take a year or two years.  How long would it then take for the new index to be bedded in?  What would happen to the people who are subject to these orders in the meantime?  It is not an exaggeration to say we could be talking about eight years before a new index would be created.  That is not acceptable for the people whose categories we are dealing with.  In its current form, the Bill provides no guarantee that any new or better index would be created.  There is no obligation to provide it and the Minister might not even bother to do so.  It is too risky.  Our amendments will bring certainty to the situation.  Given the recommendations of the bodies that surveyed this already, that is particularly important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#A00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Wallace wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#B00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>We have worked together on these amendments.

I recognise that the amendments proposed by Deputies Daly and Wallace are intended to put in place a dedicated index for adjustment of periodic payments orders, as recommended by the High Court working group on medical negligence and periodic payments.  The intention is to enable periodic payments to be index-linked to the levels of earnings of nurses and care personnel and to changes in costs of medical treatment and assistive aids and appliances, as Deputy Daly has outlined.  That being said, I am not in a position accept the proposed amendments.  I will outline the reasons and we can discuss the matters further as we go along.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 5 and the consequential amendments arising from it seeks to place an obligation on the Minister to put in place a new index, based on changes in earnings of health care personnel and the cost of medical treatment and devices and to provide that this index should be used in conjunction with the HICP to determine the annual adjustments to periodic payments orders.  The first difficulty is that the development and establishment of statistics of the type suggested by the Deputies are outside the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The proposed index would, in all probability, take longer than 12 months to implement.<\/p> <p>  Second, the proposed amendments give no guidance as to the manner in which the new index would be applied to PPOs.  It is not clear whether the new index is intended to replace the HICP.  If the intention is that both indices will be used, it is not clear what weighting would be given to each index.<\/p> <p>  Third, an actuarial study of PPOs commissioned by the State Claims Agency concluded that, in respect of indexation of PPOs, an index in the form suggested by the working group on medical negligence and periodic payments could prove to be volatile given the small sample size available in Ireland.   The study suggested that, instead, a broader based index should be used to reduce volatility and provide certainty with regard to payments under a PPO to catastrophically injured persons.  The issue of indexation of PPOs and the actuarial study to which I have just referred were considered in detail by an interdepartmental working group on legislation on periodic payments orders, which was established to examine the technical aspects of introducing PPOs.  The working group concluded that an index based on the Irish harmonised index of consumer prices should be the initial index specified in the Bill.  <\/p> <p>  Fourth, a very important matter to note in respect of indexation of PPOs is that it is not always the case that a dedicated index would provide a higher annual adjustment than the HICP.  I note, for example, that in the UK the dedicated index used was the annual survey of hours and earnings, ASHE 6115.  While the UK retail price index was historically lower than the ASHE value, since 2008 the UK RPI has outperformed ASHE 6115 by a cumulative 13%.<\/p> <p>  I believe it is vital, in putting this legislation in place, that persons who are catastrophically injured should have certainty with respect to the manner in which annual adjustments to the PPO will be made.  Given the lack of detail provided in the amendments with regard to the practical operation of the proposed index, accepting these amendments would provide less rather than more certainty regarding the operation of PPOs.  For those important reasons, I cannot accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#B00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I do not accept what the Minister of State says.  What we are talking about is exactly what the judicial working group recommended.  It pointed out that the harmonised index of consumer prices as published by the CSO does not make any special provision for an index of care costs, which is the essential component in dividing any such periodic payments.  The most costly elements, which must be tracked most closely, are the wages and care costs.  I cite the Department of Finance's paper, which dealt with this issue and considered the potential of the quarterly earnings, hours and employment costs survey published by the CSO.  This measures hourly and weekly earnings of all employees in enterprises of over 50 employees and a sample of employees in smaller enterprises.  The paper by the Department of Finance stated that over the longer term, this index would give the best outcome for recipients.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept what the Minister of State is saying to the effect that what we have put forward is some airy-fairy, unsubstantiated thing that could not be calculated.  It is the opposite.  What we are putting forward was unanimously recommended by the judicial group on medical negligence.  I remind the Minister of State that what we are trying to do here is deal with the care needs of people who have been catastrophically injured by our health service providers, by providing for the option of moving away from lump sum payments to payments made on a more sustained and better basis.  The Minister of State is right in saying that to do so, we need certainty.  Our amendments are providing for certainty because they factor in the wage and health costs.  We are deferring to the superior input of the judicial working group and our Department of Finance mandarins.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is saying that it is beyond the capacity of the Minister for Justice and Equality to come up with a revised indexation scheme.

We need to get it on the Statute Book and working.  If these amendments were accepted, we would have to consider them further, which would delay the legislation more.  I am discussing the principle of the matter.  For instance, there are technical issues, in that two indices are mentioned in amendment No. 5 and one would be used \"along with\" the other, but it does not say how that would be done.  We would have to figure out the details of doing that because the amendment is vague.  If there are two indices, does one take precedence over the other?  If one shows a higher figure than the other, do we use the higher one or the lower one?  What does \"along with\" mean?  It does not mean anything to me.

The interdepartmental group has examined these suggestions from Second Stage speeches and taken them seriously, and it has come back with this advice.  Let the legislation work for the five years.  If it is not working at the end of that time, whichever Minister is here at that stage will be mandated to report back to the Houses and the committee and so on can make a decision on whether to change it.

What is being sought in this amendment is exactly what the judicial group asked for, namely, a balancing and factoring in of earnings and costs related to medical care.  The exact way in which to do that would be a reserved function for the Minister.  It is not beyond the Government's capabilities to do that.  These elements must be factored in.  Generally speaking, the cost of medical care and treatment has increased more than the consumer price index, CPI.  The Minister of State said that it could increase less than the CPI, but the experience over the past while has been to the contrary.  We need to factor in an index of care costs.  That is what I am asking the Government to do.  How it does that is its prerogative.  The legislation would call upon the Government to strive to take account of these costs.  Actuarial assistance would be provided to it in making that a reality.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept that \"five years\" is no time, as has been suggested.

This situation gave rise to increased legal costs for the MIB, which were passed on to motor insurance consumers and delayed the introduction of PPOs for MIB claimants.<\/p><p>Following discussions with other stakeholders, including the State Claims Agency, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am satisfied that, to avoid the issues which arose in the UK, an amendment should be made to the Bill clarifying that payments eligible to be paid by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland are &quot;reasonably secure&quot; for the purpose of making a PPO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#D00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498744800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>In page 10, line 19, after &quot;Office&quot; to insert &quot;and, when it is created, the index prepared and published under section 51L(2)&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#D01000","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498744800,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p><blockquote>In page 10, line 38, after &quot;Office&quot; to insert &ldquo;and, when it is created, the index prepared and published under section 51L(2)&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#D01100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498744800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:&quot;(2) The Minister shall, within 12 months of the enactment of this Part, take such steps as are necessary to prepare and publish, or cause to be prepared and published, an index that tracks, at quarterly intervals, the following:<blockquote>(a) earnings in the nursing and care sectors, and such other sectors as appear to the Minister to be relevant to the indexation of PPOs;<br \/><br \/>(b) the costs of medical treatment in this jurisdiction;<br \/><br \/>(c) the cost of mechanical and other health aids and appliances in this jurisdiction;<br \/><br \/>(d) such other costs as appear to the Minister to be relevant to the indexation of PPOs.<\/blockquote>(3) Within 12 months of the creation of the index under subsection (2), the Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations specifying this index to be used, along with the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices as published by the Central Statistics Office, for the purpose of the annual adjustment of payments provided for under PPOs.&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#D01300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498744800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, line 8, to delete &quot;index&quot; and substitute &quot;indices&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#D01500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498744800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, line 9, to delete &quot;subsection (1)&quot; and substitute &quot;subsections (1) and (2)&quot;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#D01700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1498744800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, line 13, to delete &quot;may&quot; and substitute &quot;shall&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>We have argued this point already.

It would not be out of its hands exclusively but alone.  It is important to say that in the original heads of the Bill it was held in this section that a patient safety incident was one in which a patient was harmed or there were reasonable grounds for believing that during the provision of a health service for a patient, he or she was placed at risk of injury or harm, or an incident in which but for timely intervention the patient would have been harmed.  The definition of &quot;patient safety incident&quot; is really important as it is patient safety incidents that will be the subject of the open disclosure parts of the Bill.  The original version of the heads of Bill has been changed such that the only incident that will qualify as a patient safety incident is one where the health service provider has reasonable grounds for believing the patient was at risk or that but for a timely intervention, he or she would have been put at risk.  That gives way too much power to the health service provider.  We know from global literature and, sadly, our own experience of the HSE that developing a culture of openness and transparency is difficult.  We know that it has been challenging for the HSE.  In that sense, allowing the decision to be solely in the hands of the health service provider goes against the grain of what we are trying to do with this legislation.<\/p><p>I accept fully that in many cases the health service provider is best placed to know whether somebody was put at risk.  That goes without saying, but our amendment would not change that and the health service provider might still be the party making that input.  There may be a small number of cases where the patient or a family member sees something happen and there will be reasonable grounds for suspecting the patient or a loved one was put at risk or something happened.  They should also have the right to have an incident included, if one likes.  That is all we are trying to do.  For example, a doctor or a nurse may fill an intravenous antibiotic bag with penicillin when the patient is allergic to it and the patient may stop it happening before the line goes in.  The health service provider may not see it as a patient safety incident, but it could have been and the patient should have the right to have it examined.  That is all we are saying.  It would happen in a small minority of cases where a patient or a family member might think the patient was put at risk or there was some evidence to that effect.<\/p><p>The amendment would mean power would not be solely in the hands of the service provider.  It would help health service providers to change the culture where there is a battening down of the hatches and everything is denied.  It would help to open disclosure without imposing an onerous burden.  The provision was included in the original heads of Bill and it is what we are trying to achieve with this group of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#E01400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Open disclosure builds trust and confidence, which must be very valuable commodities in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#E01500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":478,"content":"<p>This is a very interesting discussion and I thank the Deputies for the amendments.  The definition included in the legislation follows the accepted World Health Organization's international classification of patient safety.  That definition takes into account actual adverse events where harm is caused to the patient.  We all agree on that point.  It also takes into account incidents in which harm could have been caused, or no-harm events, outcomes that did not reach the patient but which would have caused harm if they had, or \"near misses\".  It must be pointed out that in aligning our definition with that of the World Health Organization we allow the Irish health system to make international comparisons and participate in international surveillance and research on patient safety.<\/p><p>The legislation is intended to capture not only incidents where harm was caused to the patient, but also no-harm incidents and near misses.  Taking out the reference to \"in the opinion of the health service provider\" could leave things unclear.  The provider is best placed to know that there has been a near miss and what the implications could have been for the patient.<\/p><p> I believe Part 4 captures what the Deputies are talking about where it states, \"an incident which has caused an unintended or unanticipated injury, or harm, to the patient and which occurred in the course of the provision of a health service to that patient\".  Where harm has occurred, anyone can identify that and make it known.  That captures what the Deputy is trying to introduce further down.<\/p><p> It would not be appropriate to take out a reference to health service provider having reasonable grounds to believe it would cause unintended or unanticipated injury.  Very often they are the only ones who would know that.  Others may not know that.  I believe it is all captured there as it stands.  We are aligning ourselves with the WHO definition.

Our amendments do not change that.  We are providing that these incidents will be covered by the open disclosure policy.  None of that changes if these amendments are accepted.  It is necessary to have reasonable grounds.  Obviously if something happens and harm has occurred, that is easily identified by anyone who is there.  One does not have to be a doctor to know that.  If harm had not occurred or it was a near miss, there must be reasonable grounds for that.  The only impact of our amendments is who decides the reasonable grounds or to whom that authority is given.<\/p> <p>  Following changes that came between the heads of the Bill and the Bill as published, the health service provider is the only one who can do that.  I fully accept that in probably 95% of the cases the health service provider will be the one.  However, taking out the sole use will affect the 5% of cases.  Sadly, it sometimes happens that the health service provider or the person who is at the coalface might tense up, try to deny liability and not record it.  In such cases the family or the individual might have the option of having it looked at under the open disclosure provision.  It does not take anything from the health service provider.  I think it is quite important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace is right in saying this will help hospitals and health service providers move away from the cultural problems they have about accepting errors.  It will encourage them to acknowledge errors in order that a system is put in place to ensure it does not happen again.  I am strongly attached to this group of amendments.

The legislation is unusual in seeking to place an obligation on a hospital - let us call it a hospital - following a patient safety incident to tell the patient about it without any consequences for litigation or liability on the part of the hospital.  It is unusual in that respect.  That is why the definition of \"patient safety incident\" is important.  The obligation is on the hospital to disclose it.<\/p> <p>  At present the paragraph states \"in respect of which the health services provider [the hospital] has reasonable grounds to believe placed the patient at risk of unintended or unanticipated injury\".  Deputy Daly proposes to change that to cover cases in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe the patient was placed at risk.  The question relates to whose belief we are talking about.  The verb \"believe\" is used.  It currently includes the phrase \"reasonable grounds to believe\".  I would have thought that since the hospital must make the disclosure, it would be unusual if there was an obligation on the hospital to disclose something and it did not believe or did not know what happened.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly gave the example of a member of the family knowing something.  If they saw something, they would bring it to the attention of the hospital.  If the hospital then becomes aware of it and believes it and if it does nothing about it, the family can sue it.  There could be a case where the hospital is not aware of grounds and yet the obligation is imposed on the hospital to disclose this.  The important thing is to whom the belief refers.  Given that it states \"reasonable grounds to believe\", it has to be an individual.  While I could be wrong about this, I would have thought that since the ultimate obligation is on the hospital, the belief refers to the hospital.

As Deputies O'Callaghan and Daly have said, there is a very small possibility that someone outside the health service provider, a nursing home doctor or whoever, not knowing about this, and if a family member were to bring it to his or her attention, obviously then he or she would have to make a call.  We are talking about unintended and unanticipated injury where patients are placed at risk.  We are not talking about an injury that actually happened, but a step beyond that where someone was placed at risk.  In the vast majority of cases the hospital would know that.  We should not lose sight of the fact we are aligning it with the WHO definition.  It is important to link ourselves with top international standards here.  We are talking about an incident that could have placed the patient at risk or did place the patient at risk but which did not happen.<\/p> <p>  Further up the line are the other issues covered in the other part of the section.  Here the HSE or the health service provider having reasonable grounds to believe will be the person or organisation that has to make the disclosure.  We are trying to encourage voluntary disclosure.  If someone has reasonable grounds and if he or she discovers it him or herself, and in these incidents one would expect it would happen in the majority of cases, or it is brought to his or her attention where he or she did not know, that person has reasonable grounds and he or she has to volunteer to tell the patient that he or she was carrying out a procedure and an incident almost happened.<\/p> <p>  As we are linking it up with best international WHO guidelines, I would ask that we leave it as it is.

I know it is late and we have had a mad week but it is important.  These sections are about apologies and they also are linked in with the mandatory point of view.  It is clear from the definition of a patient safety incident in the Bill that we are talking about something that went wrong.  In some cases, something went wrong and the patient was hurt and in others, something went wrong and the patient was almost hurt.  The starting point is that something went wrong.  Despite that, the Bill provides that an apology for the wrong at an open disclosure meeting is entirely optional for the health service provider.  I find that mad.  The fact that an open disclosure meeting is happening at all is a clear acknowledgment that something went wrong.  It would not be happening if something had not gone wrong.  In that context, I do not understand why an apology would be optional.  If one bumps into someone in the street, or if one spills a person's pint, one says sorry.  If something goes wrong, to say sorry is natural.  We are trying to develop the natural human, cultural reaction.  Given that the Bill provides very strong protections for apologies, where just because someone says sorry that does not mean they will be sued as a result later on - that is very much in the Bill - why then would we make the apology optional?  The Bill states firmly that an apology is not an admission of liability and that it cannot be entered as evidence of liability in court.  Even were this group of amendments to be accepted, it would not change that.  An apology could not be admitted in court and it is not an admission of liability.  The amendments do not change that.  The apology is protected and I do not have a problem with that but we drafted our amendments to section 10 because apologies are incredibly important for patients and their families.  We know this from the people we have met.  An open disclosure should be about getting access to the full information but it also for them to say &quot;sorry, we did not mean for this to happen&quot;.  Quite often that could save the State a lot of money because people sometimes decide to take a legal action because they are fecked off because the health service providers would not admit they were wrong or they did not even say sorry.  Not apologising leaves us open to more hurt and angry patients and in that sense it goes against the grain of the Bill. <\/p><p>I know the Minister of State will tell me the health service provider will, of course, apologise and if that is the case, that is great.  Perhaps the Minister of State is not going to say that and will agree with me, which would be even better.  If he is going to say that such providers will do it anyway, my amendments do not alter that.  If such an apology is not made mandatory, it will not affect those providers that would do it anyway and consequently, it does not matter to them.  It is the providers that might hide behind the fact that they are not so obliged with which we are dealing.  Its absence undermines the confidence of the health service providers in the strong protections that are there.  The Bill is very strong.  Saying sorry does not mean that a provider will be sued in court or that they have admitted liability but it is a human, important thing.  It is good for the service and is good for patients and we should make it mandatory, in that the act of a provider having a meeting about an open disclosure is a statement that the provider is sorry that something happened.  It might be the case that it is saying that something happened and the consequences are very insignificant.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  That is completely in keeping with the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#G01500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Does any other member wish to speak on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#G01600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":502,"content":"<p>In British law, are there provisions regarding patient safety incidents and voluntary disclosure akin to what we are introducing here?

Our goal is to create a safe space where there can and should be full disclosure of the facts surrounding a patient safety incident and the implications, if any, for the patient's care and treatment.  Let us put that out there, it is about a safe place.  The Ombudsman is clear that many people who have complained to his office say that what they are looking for is for the service provider to acknowledge that something went wrong and to receive a meaningful - I stress meaningful - apology.  People say that they want to be listened to and assured that lessons have been learned and that the same mistake will not happen again or that every effort will be made to ensure that.  While apologies can be mandatory, I believe that voluntary apologies are far better.  I have a number of reasons for thinking that.  Is it a real apology if it is forced?<\/p><p>An apology must be a considered expression of regret.  It has to come from the heart.  It involves building trust, human relationships and human interaction in situations where this is the appropriate thing to do, which depends on the individual circumstances.  The Ombudsman outlined that it is important that, when making an apology, the person making an apology understands the other's circumstances and what his or her wishes are in regard to what occurred.  That is a good principle.  One cannot put together a meaningful apology without understanding what a patient has experienced and how this impacted on his or her individual concerns and requirements.  Empathy is a large part of this.  The giving of an apology, as Deputy Clare Daly has rightly said, is a human experience for all involved, both doctor or service provider and the patient.  It should be borne in mind that it can take time to gather all the information and facts relating to a patient safety incident.  It is only once this has been done that a meaningful apology can be given.  Otherwise the apology will simply be a box-ticking exercise, which not what members want.<\/p><p> The recent HSE evaluation of open disclosure stressed the importance of making apologies with integrity and compassion, and of having the right people informed and prepared to make an apology in advance of an open disclosure meeting.  This Bill will, for the first time in legislation, define an apology in relation to an open disclosure of a patient safety incident as an expression of sympathy or regret.  Research indicates that not all patients want an apology but when they do, such an apology needs to be personalised, sincere and honest.  This approach is further underpinned by the HSE&rsquo;s policy on open disclosure and the Medical Council&rsquo;s new guide to professional conduct and ethics for doctors and other professional codes.<\/p><p> I am mindful of members' concerns on balancing the need to provide for a full understanding of the circumstances of a patient safety incident with the need for meaningful engagement of staff with patients.  It reminds me of two children, one of whom has done something to the other, and a parent comes along and tells the guilty child to apologise, which he or she does, but does not mean.  He or she had to apologise because it was mandatory.  It did not come from the heart.  In the next breath, the child tells his or her sibling that revenge is on the way.  There needs to be a voluntary, sincere expression of remorse.  If it is made mandatory, all of that is taken out from it and it loses what we are trying to build, which is a culture of respect, openness, empathy and feeling.  If a person feels he or she is being forced to give an apology because of legislation, it is missing the whole point.  I hope members will accept the reasons I have sincerely outlined as to why I have chosen not to accept their amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#G01800","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's portrayal of \"The Simpsons\" was excellent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>On the question on what happens in the United Kingdom, there is a duty of candour for services there.

In defamation cases, one of the remedies a person generally seeks and gets is an apology but there is nothing in the Defamation Act to say that a publisher is mandated and required to apologise; it is something one does if one wants to.  Members are trying to present this legislation as though its result will be harmonious and that doctors and medics will put their hands up.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that that will happen.  Insurance will have an impact on that.  Insurance companies will insist that doctors disclose in their policy renewals whether they have had any patient safety incidents, made any open disclosures or apologised under this legislation.<\/p> <p>  The reason I asked about the UK is that although there is a duty of candour, there is nothing as specific as this legislation.  There is a provision at section 10(1)(c)(ii) of the Bill stating that if one makes a disclosure or apology it will not \"invalidate or otherwise affect\" a contract of insurance.  I am concerned that many insurance providers will now stipulate that contracts of insurance will be governed by UK law rather than Irish law, which will mean that individuals will have to disclose whether they have been party to a patient safety incident or to an apology.<\/p> <p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Clare Daly regarding an apology, the amendment under consideration is amendment No. 17, which proposes to delete &ldquo;where&rdquo; an apology is made and substitute &ldquo;when&rdquo; an apology is made in section 10(1) and I am sure that subsequent ones seek to mandate it.  An apology has legal consequences.  Irrespective of what is set down in this legislation, an apology can have future legal consequences.  On balance, an apology should be voluntary and genuine.

I am conscious that as this legislation is developed, members cannot be ignorant of its background and the problems there have been in Ireland with health service providers.  The example given by the Minister of State of a parent reprimanding a child is a good one because a parent tells a child to apologise to his or her brother or whatever - and perhaps the first time an apology is begrudgingly given - to train the child that in polite adult society, people need to learn manners, empathy and decent human behaviour when interacting with others.  It has caused huge grief and hurt to citizens and probably cost the State a significant amount of money because some people have not received an apology they felt they were owed.  It will be difficult to foster the culture we want to have if one is coming from very low base and a culture of denial because people are afraid they will end up in trouble if they give an apology, which is not true and has no legal status whatsoever.  One would never have to train an adult as one would a child because an adult has learned the behaviour.  However, we have an infantile health system which has operated poorly and needs to be retrained.  In that sense, one has to tell it to apologise to its brother because our experience has been that this has not been done.  We have all met people who have been devastated by their experiences who just needed a kindly word.  I understand that members are trying to get to a situation where that would be voluntarily provided but I believe the legislation should say that is mandatory.  To revert to my earlier point, this legislation should reinforce the confidence of health service providers that they have nothing to fear from acknowledging what happened and putting their hands up.   The committee can move to a vote on this if needed but that is the thinking behind this provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#H00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Deputy Daly has made my case for me here because she has more or less indicated that a sincere, voluntary apology is much better than a forced one.

In the example I gave of a child, I probably should have carried on to say that a parent would be better off to try to elicit a voluntary, sincere apology rather than forcing the child to give one.  That is why I have a problem with this set of amendments.  All many people want is a sincere apology.  If a patient felt that a doctor or other person was only apologising to him or her because he or she had to, the patient might conclude that the apology was meaningless and decide to sue.   If people feel the apology is sincere and real, they may decide not to take things any further, conclude that a genuine mistake was made and go no further with the matter.<\/p><p>This is a philosophical argument in some ways but an important one.  What we want to get to and start with is a sincere voluntary apology.  Starting with mandatory will lose the argument completely, as Deputy O'Callaghan has pointed out.

It is only by training and re-educating someone that one gets a system of a sincere apology.<\/p> <p>  To put this in context, I am referring to an open disclosure meeting where it has been acknowledged that something has gone wrong.  The Bill, as currently drafted, works on the premise that something has gone wrong and the health service provider only has to say that it has hurt someone, or nearly hurt him or her, and this is how we did it but there is no obligation to apologise.

This subject is a complex issue and in some ways philosophical.<\/p><p>Deputy Wallace and I tabled these amendments because we felt that section 10 required a lot of amendment.  Section 10 holds that neither the information provided nor an apology made during open disclosure will be admissible as evidence in court in regard to any action that arises from the patient safety incident that has been disclosed.  It also holds that the information provided, and an apology when it is made, will not be admissible as evidence in a professional malpractice or misconduct investigation, etc.<\/p><p>As I pointed out on Second Stage, that factual information at an open disclosure meeting could potentially be denied later by a health service provider in court is mental.  Such a situation is completely contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The Medical Injuries Alliance has pointed out that the scenario is abhorrent to the administration of justice.  I refer to a court being precluded from considering information necessary to establish the relevant facts before making a decision on a question of liability.  This is a huge issue and, therefore, this group of amendments is one of the key important groupings.<\/p><p>The proposal to prevent a patient from being able to rely on information provided during the open disclosure process will have the opposite effect and breed more distrust.  Let us say a patient is provided with clear and frank information on what caused an adverse incident but later the very same facts or version of events are denied by the service provider.  What will that scenario do for a patient's trust?  His or her trust will be shattered.  That is why my colleague and I made a distinction between an apology and information.  To deny factual information under open disclosure being used later on is completely wrong.  People gave evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health during pre-legislative scrutiny on this matter.  We are saying when litigation does occur, it should happen speedily.  If people are denied access to information they know exists or are prevented from using it, we will get into big costly proceedings.  The victims will have to pay their legal representatives to unearth the information through other processes.  The amendments call for the court to have the ability to evaluate all relevant factual evidence on foot of the incident in question.  This includes facts developed in open disclosure and any records for the purposes of making the disclosure.  That does not mean that the case will be lost or that the person's court proceedings will succeed.  The court must still evaluate the claim.  To deny information that exists as part of these proceedings would be completely wrong and that is why we tabled our group of amendments.  We have made a distinction between the information and an apology, which feeds into the earlier discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J00800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Wallace wish to add a comment to what has been said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J00900","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I will listen to the Minister of State first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J01000","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>As no other member has indicated a wish to speak, I call the Minister of State to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J01100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I am concerned that the Deputies do not understand the aim of the legislation and have missed the philosophical point, as Deputy Daly called it.  I understand there was extensive pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, as mentioned by Deputy Daly.  The matter has been examined.<\/p> <p>  This set of amendments relate to the protections given for open disclosure in relation to admissibility.  Part 4 provides for certain protections for information given to the patient at an open disclosure meeting, including that the information and written statement given to the patient are not admissible as evidence of fault or liability in a court in relation to the patient safety incident or a clinical negligence action that arises from the consequences of that patient safety incident.  I think we are in agreement.  That is the nub of the matter.  Deputies Daly and Wallace have proposed changes to this provision.  Again, my colleague, the Minister for Health, appreciates the reasons for their concerns.  I will expand further on the reasoning that led to the approach that has been taken here.<\/p> <p>  Open disclosure should be a genuine engagement between the patient and his or her doctor or health service provider.  It should not be hindered by other concerns and fears.  However, a persistent barrier to open disclosure, one which has been recognised in other jurisdictions and which has emerged from Irish research into this issue, is the perception of negative legal consequences arising from engaging in open disclosure.  The origins of the provision in Part 4 on non-admissibility as evidence of fault or liability lie in the recommendations made by the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in its report called Building a Culture of Patient Safety.  The commission was chaired by Professor Deirdre Madden.  It identified fear of litigation as a barrier to open disclosure.  It recommended that legislation should ensure that open disclosure, which is undertaken in compliance with national standards, cannot be used in litigation against the person making the disclosure.  Fear of litigation was also a consistent issue raised in the HSE's evaluation of the national open disclosure pilot scheme.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health was sympathetic to the view that buy-in is essential to open disclosure.  The culture in our health service can sometimes stand in the way of people making open disclosures and this fear is part of that culture.<\/p> <p>  The intention behind Part 4 is to initiate a culture shift by supporting an environment where the patient's information needs can be addressed positively and as soon as possible.  Patients will receive information applicable to the patient safety incident in an open disclosure made under Part 4.  Moreover, they will still have full access to their medical records which, in line with good professional practice, will contain all information relevant to their care and treatment and will continue to be admissible.  On balance, it is considered that the system of open disclosure provided for in the Bill offers the greatest likelihood that patients will receive the information they seek after an incident without the need to resort to the courts system simply to get a straight answer.<\/p><p>A consistent theme from patients is that they prefer to receive information and explanations and, where appropriate, an apology directly after an incident and not have to go down a legal route to get this information or apology.  Litigation may sometimes be inevitable, but it should never be the case that a patient or his or her family has to go to court simply to find out information on a patient safety incident.  Ultimately, open disclosure is a human process underpinned by honesty and respect.

In many instances, patients might decide that they do not need to go to court or proceed to litigation at all based on their having received all of the information they need and a sincere apology.

It states the disclosure or apology shall not, notwithstanding any other enactment or rule of law, be admissible as evidence of fault or liability of the hospital or the doctor.  It does not state the apology shall not be admissible but that it will not be admissible as evidence of fault or liability.  I would have believed somebody taking a case on behalf of an individual who was apologised to by a doctor could produce that evidence at a hearing and state he or she was not relying on it as evidence of fault for liability but to ask the doctor whether he had apologised to the client after the operation.  That will obviously be a powerful piece of evidence in front of a judge.  If a hospital or a doctor apologises, or if there is disclosure, it will come out, but it cannot be relied on by the court as evidence of fault or wrongdoing.  It is, however, relevant in terms of the general factual matrix of the case.  The concerns of Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace will not be as problematic for a person taking a case as interpreted on a first reading.

What we are proposing would not change any of that in that apologies are indemnified legally and no admission of liability or nothing we are doing would change that in that it could not be used against somebody.  What the Bill does do, however, is provide that information gathered through an open disclosure is prohibited from being utilised as evidence in later court proceedings, but that goes against the grain entirely.  Denying in court a statement or evidence given in an open disclosure meeting will cause a huge problem.  Consider the circumstances if the policy works properly and we all get to where we are trying to go, which would entail health service providers changing a deeply ingrained cultural problem in the service.  Let us be honest about this problem.  There has been a voluntary open disclosure mechanism in place since 2013 and it has not really changed anything.  That is where our amendments are coming from.  There has to be a means of forcing open disclosure.  To say something produced in an open disclosure may not be relied on later by somebody in a court case is completely wrong.  Where there is something in a file stating a certain incident occurred and the person concerned is not happy with the open disclosure process, he or she may decide to proceed to litigation later.  The Bill should be about reducing the volume of litigation.  Where the legislation would make knowledge disclosed of a certain incident inadmissible, one would have to employ really costly medical experts to obtain information proving the occurrence of what one knows occurred.  There would be much more costly and lengthy litigation at the later stage.  Information is never excluded from these processes.  On the point I made earlier, it is still up to the courts to decide whether the action succeeds based on the information made available.  We are just talking about the potential to hide information from the courts.<\/p><p>We do understand the Bill and that it is being put forward as a benefit for patients.  That is what we would all like to see happen, but the way in which the Bill is framed is very much about preventing litigation and the fear of litigation which have been part of HSE culture in any case.  The implication is that openness with information, apologies and all the rest will lead to litigation and more payouts whereas it should be the opposite.  The evidence suggests it can be the opposite, which is what we want.  We are about encouraging openness and reducing litigation, not the opposite.<\/p><p>There was a good quote from the British Government when it brought forward its duty-of-candour regulation of 2014:<\/p><blockquote>One of the most commonly cited barriers to providers being candid is the fear that being candid and providing more upfront information about patient incidences can lead to a risk of increased litigation, and that offering an apology might be interpreted as an admission of liability.  On the other hand, it has also been suggested that being candid can actually reduce litigation costs, as often the main motivation for bringing about a medical negligence claim is to seek more information about mistakes in their care, or due to a perceived failure of the provider to apologise.  Overall the evidence on the likelihood of litigation is unclear.<\/blockquote> <p>Based on this, what we are trying to do is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#K00600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>On Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's points which were well made, the case notes or details of an incident will obviously be in the medical records.

It will be on the record  Future care needs will also be on the record.<\/p><p> We are on parallel tracks.  On one track we are trying to encourage, as the Deputy said, open disclosure and, where appropriate, the free apology and so on.  The medical practitioner will meet the patient and say he or she is making an open disclosure, this is what happened, these are the consequences, this is what needs to be done for the patient's medical care and away we go.  The legal process and all the medical records are on the other track.  We are trying to keep the tracks parallel but separate.  We want to ensure that whatever happens between the patient and the medical provider in making the disclosure, there will not be a chilling effect or impediment to full disclosure of all the information the patient needs or to any question the patient asks being answered and to a sincere apology being given.  It is about building up the relationship between the patient and the medical provider.  The concern is the medical providers might think they have to be careful about what they say and believe they cannot say something because it will be used in court against them or they cannot write something down in an open disclosure because it will end up in court, which would impede the other track we want to keep as open as possible.<\/p><p> The intention of the open disclosure track is to inform patients about what happened as early as possible in the process.  If patients then seeks the medical records, the information will be there and if they want to take the legal route, that can happen as well.  They may not want to do that and they may decide a mistake was made, an incident occurred but they have received a sincere apology and they need to get his fixed now by working with their doctor, who is sorry about this.  This is where we are coming from.  We are seeking a change of culture.  We do not want medical providers looking over their shoulders at an open disclosure meeting and wondering whether they should have their solicitor sitting beside them to advise them on what they should or should not say because it could end up in court.

Amendment No. 24 is the most important.  This relates to the discussion we have just had and, therefore, I will not repeat the points raised.  I will, however, strengthen some of them.  The Bill proposes a voluntary open disclosure system.  It would be remiss of me not to point that there has been a voluntary open disclosure policy in our hospitals since 2013 and all the evidence and anecdotes point to the fact that it has not done much good.  The UK system of a mandatory duty of candour is much better.  When the Bill was before the health committee, it was stated mandatory open disclosure could make the reporting of near misses less likely, to which the Minister of State referred earlier, and that was teased out.  The jury is out on that and the evidence does not necessarily support that.<\/p><p>Second, open disclosure of serious incidents is too important in the context of patient safety for disclosure by staff and health service providers to be left on a voluntary footing.  This has to be viewed in the context of the ingrained culture in the health service to deny and cover up.<\/p><p>There are too many examples of this culture.  The response of the health service to the hepatitis C scandal, the deaths of babies in Portlaoise hospital and cases of maternal deaths and catastrophic injuries has been to admit nothing.  This approach is ingrained in the Health Service Executive and will not change if we say, \"Listen lads, do not worry about it now.\"  We have to tackle this culture head on.<\/p><p> Failure to introduce mandatory disclosure will result in honest health care providers that make disclosures being penalised because other providers do not disclose.  This is a catch-22 scenario.  I have been contacted, as I am sure have other Deputies, by people who have experienced serious medical negligence, particularly around births.  Notwithstanding the voluntary open disclosure policy in place and despite having repeated meetings with the relevant health service provider, they were not told everything they needed to know.  They had to take cases to court to obtain the information they needed, which is precisely what we are trying to avoid in this legislation.  The Bill came about because of the policy of voluntary disclosure.<\/p><p> To give an example, one couple who contacted me had to pay &euro;10,000 for expert reports to get answers about what happened to their child.  They also had to pay for specialised health care for their child for the three years it took for the case to come to court.  Voluntary open disclosure will not address any of these cases because it is already in place.  Mandatory open disclosure and the measures provided for in our amendments, including the protection provided in cases where apologies are made, would go a long way towards addressing this issue.  Amendment No. 24 is of particular importance to us.  <\/p><p> A second group of amendments provides that the disclosure will take place as soon as practicable after the incident.  As currently drafted, the Bill leaves it to the health service provider to make a disclosure at a time it considers to be appropriate.  A more speedy reply should be mandated.  Obviously, it would not be appropriate for a service provider to have a meeting when the person is still ill or sick.  The provision that the hospital will make a statement when it is appropriate to do so, having regard to the health of a patient, goes without saying.  The term \"as soon as is practicable\" covers this but the current wording is too open-ended.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#L02100","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State explain the reason open disclosure will not be mandatory?

The definition in section 8 refers to a patient having been caused an \"unintended or unanticipated injury, or harm\".  One would have thought the patient should be told of such an event.

The Minister for Health fully appreciates the reasons some Deputies believe open disclosure should be mandatory.  Deputy Daly indicated there was some contact earlier today on the issue.  Considerable deliberation of the respective advantages of a mandatory and voluntary open disclosure framework took place before we came to a view that a voluntary approach offered the best way forward.  This judgment, which is one informed by the Commission on Patient Safety and international evidence, is that this legislation will be successful only if there is a marked culture shift - I return to this issue of a culture shift - within our health services and that the best way of facilitating that change lies with fostering a voluntary approach to open disclosure.  Deputies will agree that if we want to reach a point where voluntary disclosure takes place.<\/p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Joint Committee on Health also considered this issue in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the open disclosure legislative proposals.  The joint committee was sympathetic to the views expressed by stakeholders that cultural buy-in to open disclosure is necessary to its success and was wary of introducing a mandatory burden on front-line workers which could hinder the desired outcomes we all want to see emerge.  Internationally, a blame culture has been shown to stifle the learning that a good patient safety culture requires.  We return again to the philosophy of culture.  Open disclosure is a human experience for all involved, both the doctor and the patient.  As I have stated repeatedly, it should be a meaningful engagement between the doctor and the patient, not a tick-box exercise. <\/p><p>The committee recommended that the success of voluntary open disclosure should be assessed in the future.  If it appears the voluntary system is not having a satisfactory impact on increasing rates and quality of disclosure, the possibility of mandatory open disclosure could be then considered.  The Minister for Health has given a commitment to do this.  It is of note in that regard that recent inspections of hospitals by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, have identified a growing awareness of open disclosure across the health system.  Open disclosure is already beginning to take place. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 36 provides for a statement of what further inquiries into a patient safety incident the provider believes are appropriate and which of these it will undertake.  The Minister for Health considered this amendment and sought legal advice.  The advice given is that the current provision already covers such further inquiries the health services body believes are appropriate and which it will undertake.  Therefore, the proposed amendment appears to be unnecessary. <\/p><p>I assure Deputies that the open disclosure provisions are one part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents.  The Minister for Health has recently approved new standards on the conduct of reviews of patient safety incidents which expand on the existing national standards for safer better health care.  The new standards were developed by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission and will be published shortly<i>.  <\/i>This set of standards, along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and the provisions on open disclosure we are discussing, will provide a comprehensive patient centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.  This may address the issue raised by Deputy O'Callaghan. <\/p><p>The Minister for Health has directed the recently established national patient safety office to prioritise the early progression of these important patient safety initiatives.<\/p><p>I have endeavoured to set out the carefully considered pros and cons of mandatory versus voluntary open disclosure.  For the reasons I have outlined I hope Deputies will understand that I cannot accept their amendments.<\/p><p>We all agree that our objective is to achieve a shift in culture.  Let us be courageous and seek to achieve voluntary open disclosure, which international evidence shows is the best outcome.  We want to encourage this model, rather than mandatory disclosure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#M00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Following its pre-legislative discussion of the Bill, the Joint Committee in Health issued a report showing that the evidence to show voluntary disclosure is preferable to mandatory disclosure is drawn from one study published in 2000.

Given where we are starting, mandatory reporting is absolutely the best way.  There is no definitive evidence to say that voluntary reporting will work.  Take the example I gave earlier of the parents with the catastrophically injured baby.  That operated at the time when we had this voluntary open disclosure policy in our hospitals.  The parents went to three meetings with the health care provider.  Despite that, they found that basic and crucial information about what had happened was withheld from them, and they only got it when they went to court.  The reason they had to go to court was that there was no obligation under the present system for the health care provider to provide that.  That is what we are trying to deal with.<\/p> <p>  One can think about the scenario outlined by Deputy O'Callaghan where there is a clinical team in an operating room, a nurse sees something untoward such as a near miss and wants to report it, and the doctors tell the nurse that it did not happen or try to bully her into silence.  That one is mandated and has a legal obligation to disclose evidence of a near miss gives protection to employees who want to go in that direction.

For patient safety, there should not be an option about making a disclosure about negligence or something that has occurred to a person within the health service.  To make that optional is hypocritical in the extreme.  The whole approach to medical ethics is to ensure there is openness, and this would put that in a forthright way in the statute, which is important.  To make an optional aspect to this, which is what the legislation does by saying a health service provider may make an open disclosure on patient safety incidents, is contradictory in itself.  There should be more of a positive obligation on the health service provider and on the clinical team to disclose openly and properly whatever the incident was or is.  We should do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#N00300","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":559,"content":"<p>In the absence of any other Deputies indicating a wish to speak, I ask the Minister of State to make a further reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#N00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":560,"content":"<p>We are back down to two sides.  We all want to end up in the same place.  There is no dispute or disagreement.  The Minister is committed to evaluating the approach that is proposed.  He suggests that we need to allow it to bed down and give it a chance to work.  We all agree that voluntary open disclosure, if it works, will be the best outcome.  We propose to start with the best outcome, which is voluntary open disclosure.  The current open disclosure situation was referred to, but there is no protection for staff at present if someone makes a voluntary open disclosure.  If someone says he or she did something, there is no protection.  One could argue that is one of the reasons it is not happening to the extent it should.  The Bill sets a clear standard for open disclosure, so it is not just a matter of mandatory disclosure, but there is a whole package here and it is all linked together.  It provides for a written statement to patients, which is not now current practice.  That is also part of it.<\/p> <p>  I would like Deputies to look at the Bill in the round and to take in the cultural shift we want to get here.  If anything mandatory is brought in, it goes against the thrust of this Bill.  As it happens, open disclosure is HSE policy anyway, but we want to improve it and encourage it because we want more of it.  The medical ethics code, as I understand it, obliges disclosure too.  This whole Bill is a package.  It is not just one thing.  By having voluntary open disclosure, we are not forcing people to do anything.  People want to do it because it is the right thing to do.  They are protected in doing it as well, and we are building up the relationship between patients, service providers and doctors.  We are building trust there and that is important.  If one thinks of it in the round and if we can get to voluntary open disclosure as a practice, as we are beginning to see happen anyway, and I think people want to go there, it will be a win-win for everyone.  It would be better than if we made it mandatory and forced people to do things which should be voluntary.  I think we agree that, ideally, they should be voluntary, and if we put in place the necessary protections for people in order that they feel safe in having the candid and open conversations they need to have with their patients, it is a win-win.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is committed to evaluating this if it does not work and looking at it again.  He asks that we give this a chance because we believe, given the evidence, that this is the best approach.  Let us encourage it, give it a chance, put it in place and evaluate it as it goes on.  If it does not work to the extent we hope it will, we will move back from there.  The Health Information and Patient Safety Bill mandates reporting of serious incidents.  That is on the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#N00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>On the last point, which we can come back to later, where is the line drawn on what is serious and what is not?  Maybe there is one I do not know about.  I understand the argument the Minister of State is making and where he is coming from.  I do not think it is a difference of philosophy between what we are arguing and what he is arguing.  One of the biggest differences is the animal we are dealing with.  It reminds me a little of the police.  When the Patten report was done in Northern Ireland, which looked at the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, the conclusion was that one could forget about changing how that force operated unless one got rid of the hierarchy, so that is what happened.  Members of the RUC were paid off to go, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, was formed.  It is not perfect, but it is much better than the RUC was.  I am not in Northern Ireland often since I live in Wexford.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is an incredibly dysfunctional organisation where I come from and I could not exaggerate enough how many complaints I get about the attitude of the people in authority in the section of that organisation in my area.  It is horrific and we are looking at the animal we are dealing with, and the Minister of State is looking at a more perfect situation.

Whether one is a doctor or a builder, people can make mistakes.  Part of the reason they do not own up to them, apologise and say they made a mistake, which is the right thing to do, is because they feel they are immediately going to be condemned by the world at large.

That is another day's work for the other committee, possibly.<\/p> <p>  It is not just the HSE we are talking about here; it is the local general practitioner and other health service professionals who might be involved.  It is wider than just the HSE.  There are an awful lot of very good people working in the HSE.  Individually, one or two of them might make the type of mistakes we are discussing.  The whole thrust of this Bill is to protect, encourage and support them in disclosing those mistakes and apologising, where appropriate.  That is where we are going.  If it does not work, we can change it.  If we can change the whole culture that Deputy O'Callaghan outlined so well, then that is what we should aim to do.  We should aim to change the culture, get away from the blame game and get away from a situation in which people cannot sleep at night because they made mistakes, are worried sick about their patients and are not in a position to own up because they are afraid of the consequences.  The patient in such cases may need information and gets angrier and angrier because something has gone wrong.  We want to move away from all that.  We want to reach a position whereby a person can make an open disclosure, the patient gets all the information - if the mistake is quite serious, the relationship might not be the same and might fracture - but, in any event, the patient will have the information he or she requires and will have an apology if that is appropriate and is accepted.  It may not be accepted.  We also want this culture to feed back to the next patient and the patient after that.  We want this practice to feed back right through the system.  I say to colleagues that it is worthwhile being courageous and trying to make this work and supporting it to make it work.  I do not think we are making a mistake.  If it does not work after a period, it can be revisited - and the Minister for Health is determined and has committed to do that - but let us give it a chance, be optimistic about it, support and encourage it and be positive towards it.  If we can do that and if it works, it is a win-win for everyone.  If it does not work, we can change it.  However, it is worth having a go.  Let us be courageous and positive.

Through sharing these experiences, the witnesses will set out the reality of those in need of mental health services, and those providing these services as well as from the policy makers.  The committee hopes that through this public consolation initiative, we can first, highlight and provide details of the present situation whereby children are being placed into adult psychiatric units; second, analyse the effect on providers of primary and secondary care who seek out of hours and weekend care and on children and families in distress; third, discuss the waiting list for initial assessment under the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS, by reference to different CAMHS catchments; fourth, identify reasons for unsustainable waiting lists for mental health services including staffing shortfalls in multidisciplinary primary care centres and the role of child psychiatrists under the Mental Health Act 2001 and the reliance on assessments being approved by child psychiatrists; fifth, look at best practice and the most successful models in mental healthcare for children and adolescents; and sixth, create proposals to decrease waiting lists and streamline inpatient care.  Following our two public hearings, a draft report will be prepared for our committee by our rapporteur, Senator Joan Freeman.  The committee will review the draft report and publish its final report as soon as possible thereafter.  <br\/><br\/>Today's meeting will consist of two sessions.  In the morning, we will hear from the families who are using the service and in the afternoon session, we will hear from advocacy groups and service providers.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the witnesses to this morning's session, Ms Lauren Keogh, Ms Paula Dalton, Ms Louise Walsh, Ms Sin&eacute;ad McGee and Ms Martina Kelly.  They are most welcome and we thank them for engaging with the committee in its consideration of this most important and sensitive topic.  <br\/><br\/>Before we begin, I must advise them that by virtue of 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Any opening statements that have been submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.<br\/><br\/>I now invite Senator Joan Freeman to make some introductory remarks.  I will then invite each witness to make a short presentation to the committee.  When the presentations have finished, there will be time for questions and comments from the senators and responses from the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#A00200","speaker":"1420","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":691,"content":"<p>Earlier, I sat among these women who are speaking to us this morning and the description that came to me immediately was that these are warriors of Ireland.  We are among five warriors.  These are mothers who have travelled a journey with their children and have agreed to come here today to tell the public and the Government about the nature of their journey so far.  I call them warriors because they have had to fight tooth and nail from the day their child was first diagnosed to where they are today.  They are also warriors because they are speaking in public.  They are all very nervous. Not only have they never spoken in this Chamber before, they have probably never spoken about their experiences publicly before and I very much appreciate them and their coming here today.<\/p> <p>  They wanted to take and show a photograph of their child so that members can see that this is a person we are talking about, not a number.  I am asking the Chairman that we ensure that the cameras would not focus on the child because we need to make sure that this child is not stigmatised in any way.  The witnesses want to show the people present that they are talking about a little boy or girl.  <\/p> <p>  This public consultation day is about painting a picture.  It is about painting a picture of what mental health services are like in Ireland but particularly what it is like for our children and their families.  This is not about accusing anyone.  It is not about accusing the government, the CAHMS or the HSE; we are here to paint a picture.  What we see or hear up to now are reports.  There have been 12,000 reports on children and mental health services but now members are going to see and hear the real story about what it is like to live the experience of the services here in Ireland.  This morning is about listening to these parents and this afternoon we will listen to what it is like for the service providers, those who are on the front line, to work in this area and with the resources available to them.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and everyone for coming here this morning.  I am sorry there is not a bigger turnout.  I know that Ms Kelly, for instance, has been up since 4 a.m. and travelled from Sligo, but I can assure her that I will continue to fight for her on this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#B00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":692,"content":"<p>I welcome the women once again and ask Ms Lauren Keogh to begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#B00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":693,"content":"<p>My name is Lauren and I live in Meath, falling under CHO 8.  I had my daughter Zara when I was 16 years old.  A lone parent, very young and vulnerable, my parents supported me to ensure that I finished school, went on to college and worked full time to ensure I could provide for Zara.  I have since married David, Zara's stepfather, and we have another daughter together, Robin, who is five years old.  Zara is 13 years old.  She is a funny character who always seeks a smile from others.  She has a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, borderline mild general learning disability, hereditary neuropathy with tendency to pressure palsies, HMPP, and more.  As a result of her diagnosis, Zara is listed on both disability registers, the ID and autism register and the physical and sensory register.  She adores animals and is involved in a charity called Olivia's Special Horses, therapeutic horse riding, for the past two years.  The founder of this charity gave Zara her very own horse called Felim.  Zara is obsessed with him.<\/p> <p>  Zara was quite young when she presented with challenges.  When she was in junior infants she was referred to psychology in school for her behavioural issues.  She took her shoes and socks off during class daily, she was defiant and refused to co-operate with staff, including the principal.  She struggled with concentration, she could not differentiate between work and playtime, and I was regularly called to the school to collect her.  There was a slight improvement after psychological intervention when demands were reduced and adaptions made but we would continue to have regular challenges.  At six years old she developed a palsy in her right leg which lasted six months.  Through the neurology department in Temple Street, she was diagnosed with HMPP, a physical disability affecting the nerves in her limbs.  When Zara reached fifth class in school, she became very aware of her difficulties and compared herself to her peers daily.  The school could not provide a NEPS assessment so we went privately at a cost of &euro;600, choosing not to pay my mortgage.  Zara had learning difficulties.  The educational psychologist also had concerns around ADHD.<\/p> <p>  The school then referred us to the disability team for assessment of need.  The purpose of the assessment of need is to assess the child's needs and what services are required.  She was labelled with a physical disability and all other concerns were dismissed.  I challenged this and was advised that the disability team had labelled my child as physically disabled and what more did I want.  I felt physically sick.  I gathered from that that the staff only wanted to tick a box and move on to the next case.  I highlighted the educational psychologist's concerns of ADHD and asked how they could just dismiss the observations of the professionals.<\/p><p>I was told they would look into it and call me back.  Shortly after, I was told that the staff member dealing with Zara's assessment did not read the report submitted by the educational psychologist and that they would refer me to CAMHS after discovering this.  I can only presume that the staff did not have time to read all the reports.  Sickened I had that awful battle, I was glad that Zara was going to get the right service.  \"Thank God\", I thought.  Then I discovered that the waiting list was another 18 months.<\/p><p> After two months sitting on the 18 month waiting list for CAMHS Zara stopped eating and made regular comments about being fat.  She also vocalised regular suicidal thoughts.  Zara was ten years old.  She needed supervision 24-7 so I had no choice but to leave work.  The house needed to be cleared of anything with which she could harm herself.  We hid the knives, medication, matches for candles and so forth.  I chose not to pay my mortgage that month again and went for a private assessment.  Expecting ADHD she was diagnosed on the autistic spectrum, which should have been identified initially in the assessment of need.<\/p><p> I went back to my GP and doctor on call, as I did not know where else to seek urgent help for her.  The GP sent another referral to CAMHS outlining the seriousness of my concerns.  Zara was seen within three weeks - that was May 2015 - and soon after was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.  CAMHS do not deal with disabilities so they would not provide psychology to address the root cause of anorexia.  They also advised initially that they do not accept private diagnosis and they would only treat Zara as having HNPP.  I asked them to treat Zara as Zara.  I did not care about the label but needed help with the challenges she presented.  Within a few weeks of thorough dealings with Zara for anorexia, CAMHS agreed with her private diagnosis of ASD.  CAMHS referred her back to the disability team in October 2015 in respect of her ASD.  They also diagnosed anxiety, sensory issues and difficulty managing emotional regulation.  They provided a block of occupational therapy, OT, for this.  Zara was discharged from CAMHS in November 2016 as she had beaten anorexia.  That was a year and a half after starting with CAMH services.<\/p><p> However, Zara was still sitting idle on the waiting list for the disability team.  It took more than 18 months on a waiting list to get back to the team that she first went to for an assessment of need, two and a half years after her initial referral for the assessment of need.  Zara had her first psychology appointment on 13 June 2017 with the disability team.<\/p><p> There were many delays to Zara's treatment due to the current system.  Under the Disability Act 2005, I was entitled to a service statement outlining Zara's needs and the services required within one month of Zara's assessment of need being completed, but the liaison officer who provides the service statement was on long-term sick leave.  It took two years for me to receive Zara's service statement.  Her assessment of need was completed in February 2015 and I only received the statement in February 2017.  During these two and a half years Zara had a great deal to deal with - multiple diagnoses, including the unnecessary battle with anorexia nervosa, three operations, becoming a wheelchair user, three school moves as well as her daily challenges.  Zara is only now receiving the correct services, two and a half years later.  We were fobbed from one waiting list to another at a cost to our daughter's mental and physical health.<\/p><p> As a parent of a child battling her way through the system I have been through much unnecessary stress.  Thankfully for my children's sake, I am a dedicated mother with a supportive husband and I pulled together the mental strength to consistently fight my way through this journey.  There is no support for parents going through the system.  Nobody tells one anything about the supports available or even where to look for resources.  Last year, I was prescribed Xanax to help me cope.  However, this affected me physically and I struggled to function.  I decided to do a part-time FETAC level 6 course privately and at another cost.  I qualified as a special needs assistant purely to try and cope with the demands of my daughter's needs.  I was always very driven and had many goals to continuously develop and progress in life, always pushing myself further.  Now my goal is to get through the day.  As a person diagnosed with high functioning autism too, this is extremely difficult to adapt to.  Even more difficult to comprehend is the lack of support available to siblings.  I expect Robin to have complex issues in the future caused by the impact of Zara's meltdown.  Something as simple as the availability of a sibling coping skills group or a peer support programme would make a huge difference.<\/p><p> I understand funding is everything, but we are only kicking a can down the road.  These issues must be dealt with while children are young to teach them the coping skills and to teach the parents and give them the tools to help their child.  Otherwise there will be enormous demands on the services in their adult lives.  I am aware the funding allocated is based on the figures on the disability register.  If the staff had time to deal with each case adequately, the results and figures recorded on the register for funding would be factual.  Other children are being missed and not listed on the disability register.  Ours was one of those families.  Zara's autism diagnosis was identified through the assessment of need.  During the assessment my concerns were not listened to, I was made to feel like an inconvenience and then like a parent wanting a label.  All I wanted was the correct support, fearing what was to come if I did not get Zara the help I knew she desperately needed.<\/p><p> While excuses are made by those who are accountable, they are choosing not to eliminate the waste within the system.  We must ask questions.  What are we trying to achieve?  Is it working?  A system with enormous waste resulting in life threatening effects on its clients is not fit for purpose.  As a person who likes things to be productive, meaningful and efficient, I encountered a huge amount of waste within the system and items that add value to a service not being utilised, for example, staff not being replaced when on leave, reports not being read, fobbing children from one waiting list to another and so forth.  With HSE staff under serious pressure to cope with the demands, it is no wonder many are out on leave and the turnover is huge.  I fear the future.  What do I do if the psychologist we waited so long for gets pregnant or becomes ill?  She will not be replaced, and neither will my daughter if she succeeds the next time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Lauren Keogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":695,"content":"<p>I am in the CHO 5 area.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak about my son Rhys who is 13 years old.  I will hold up his photograph to the members.<\/p> <p>  Rhys was born at 34 weeks gestation.  He was very small and had to fight a great deal harder than other children to get home from hospital.  I never felt such joy as on the day I held my beautiful little boy in my arms.  Rhys was diagnosed with high functioning autism when he was four years old.  Even with this diagnosis, my son was a very happy, sociable little boy with family and close friends.  Rhys was always a happy, energetic child who had a great love of learning about animals and different countries and their cultures.  He taught himself basic French in a weekend when he was six years of age.  He was extremely intelligent.  He loves to go out with his friends and to have pizza at a youth club.  He wants to be a boy who can do everything his friends can do.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, my son first showed signs of self-harming.  He tried to cut himself with a butter knife.  He also tried to stop eating.  When asked why his reply was, \"So I can die\".  My son was eight years old and he wanted to die.  He said, \"I want to close my eyes and they never open again, so I don't feel any more pain\".  For a parent, this was awful.  I will never forget looking at him and wondering why and how this had happened and where my little happy boy had gone.  As my son was diagnosed with autism we had access to the ASD team.  We contacted the team and the team saw him and spoke with him.  The team felt his needs had clearly gone beyond its area of expertise so it referred him to CAMHS.  We waited 12 months for an appointment.  At the appointment we met with the psychologist.  She spoke with us and my son and said she would see us again.  We were waiting six months for the next appointment.  When we got there we had a different psychiatrist who asked us why we had turned up that day and why we were there.  I had to show him my letter to prove we had an appointment.  He did not know we were due to arrive there.<\/p> <p>  There were another few months of going back and forth and each time there was a different psychiatrist.  This upset my son.  As he was nervous he did not wish to speak to somebody he did not know.  Then he was discharged.  We did not know he was discharged.  We found out six months later from our GP.  We got no letter of discharge.  In October 2016, my son attempted suicide.  We took him to our GP who sent us to the emergency department.  We were sitting in a waiting room full of other people for over four hours.  Nobody had seen our son.  Then a nurse came to tell us that we had to go to a different hospital two hours away as the hospital did not have a child psychiatrist to see our son.  We went to the next hospital and the CAMHS team was wonderful.  Its members calmed him down and spoke to us.  They highlighted that they were extremely concerned for my son and said there was a CAMHS team in our hospital.<\/p><p>It said it would fax our hospital and explain the urgency of the situation.  It was hoped that we would be seen within the next few days.  That did not happen.  We waited three weeks for an appointment.  It does not seem long, but when one's child is physically trying to hurt himself, is not sleeping, is hearing voices and is terrified, three weeks is a very long time to be dealing with something that one does not know how to deal with.  We eventually contacted a local politician in our area and we got an appointment.  We went to CAMHS and it spoke to our son.  He explained that he was hearing voices and that the voices were telling him to kill himself.  He was terrified.  He was seeing shadows and hearing footsteps.  He was convinced, especially at night, that someone was coming to kill him.  My son was terrified.  He was told that the voices are not real and that he should not listen to them.  That was not enough of an intervention for him.  <\/p><p> We were told that our son needed to be watched 24-7 and that he should be physically restrained if necessary.  Every night he would be so scared that he would cry, scream and try to run out of the house because he felt that something was chasing him.  He would eventually fall asleep in my arms, exhausted.  My partner works nights, so I would be at home with my son on my own.  I remember that I was awake for almost 72 hours straight.  My eyesight went fuzzy and I had a headache.  I did not feel tired anymore, but I did not feel alive either.  On one occasion I was so terrified that I would fall asleep I walked up and down the hall with a cup of coffee in my hand at 3 o'clock in the morning.  We knew that this could not continue.  We had Rhys in the bed with us sometimes but he did not want that.  He was almost 13 years old and sleeping in between us was not acceptable, so we bought a bed and put it into our room.   For safety we locked him into the room with us every night, and at least that way I could sleep and Rhys could possibly sleep as well.<\/p><p> On another night my son attempted to seriously self-harm and we took him to the emergency department because it was out of hours.  Rhys and I were put into a small waiting room and we had to wait for over two hours for the on-call psychiatrist.  Rhys escaped from that room that night and ran through an emergency department full of adults screaming, \"Please let me die\".  He was trying to escape from the hospital and get outside.  He said that he wanted to run under a car and die.  I took flight after him.  Security and a nurse did likewise.  We caught him and had to bring him back.  It was so distressing.  We were in this room and all these people were looking at us.  It was awful.  An emergency department is not the answer.  It is not able to deal with this situation.  The environment is wrong.  It is not very safe.  I was in that room with him and he was still able to get out of that room.  It is not a suitable situation for a child.  When we saw the on-call psychiatrist that night he was put on medication to calm him and help him sleep, but he was sent home that night.  He slept in between us.  He did not really sleep but spent the night hitting his head in an attempt to get the voices out.<\/p><p> In subsequent months, we were over and back to CAMHS regularly, but he did not improve much.  When there was a small improvement, even if he had said that he wanted to die on the same day, he was discharged.  Only two weeks ago Rhys attempted suicide.  He left a suicide message on my phone.  To me that is an escalation.  He is thinking more about what he wants to do.  He was saying goodbye to his mother and telling me that it was not my fault.  My partner caught him, thankfully.  He is now being seen by CAMHS again.  He is on stronger medication, but the sad reality is that medication is not always the answer.  He needs psychology.  We have been told that he is not going to receive this from CAMHS.  He is now on a waiting list in the disability services for psychology.  He has been on that waiting list for almost four years.  This psychologist does not exist in our area.  There is no psychologist for a child over six years of age.  Why is that?  How can that be?  My son is one of many children who need this help.  CAMHS is overworked and understaffed, which is unfair on it and its clients.  The waiting lists are far too long for children who need help now.  Children presenting with suicidal and mental health issues cannot always wait for 12 months.  They need action now.<\/p><p> I want to point out that there is no out of hours service for children with mental health issues.  There is no safe environment for a child to go into an accident and emergency department presenting with mental health issues.  I would never allow my son to be put into an adult psychiatric unit.  This should never happen.  It is not acceptable or appropriate.  As a country, we need to improve these services, open more children's psychiatric units and have more psychiatrists and psychologists available for our children.  It is not okay for a child with suicidal thoughts or who has attempted suicide to be put on a waiting list.  They need help and intervention and they need it now.  This is a basic human right which our children are being denied.  Our children deserve better treatment, and their well-being needs to be prioritised.  Unfortunately, this is an ongoing issue for my son, who is telling me that he has given up and that he just wants to die.  I believe him.  He does not want to feel pain any more.  As a family we have been badly affected by this.  We cannot go out with our friends.  We cannot bring him to his favourite places, such as the zoo, anymore.  If a place is too crowded he gets too stressed and is hearing things that are not there.  He is afraid to go out and play sometimes.  We are at home all day, every day.  He just wants to go to school.<\/p><p> I want my little boy back, that beautiful, happy little child that had so much energy and loved living life.  I need him back.  He needs to come back.  Can anyone imagine being a parent and seeing this awful transformation occur?  We have tried everything in our power but it is clearly beyond the parents' control.  I am scared that my son will achieve his goal.  I am scared that he is going to die.  I want my son to get the help he needs.  I want to get my once happy little family back, and I want my beautiful boy to get his confidence back.  He once said that he wants to become an animal biologist.  I want to see him achieve this goal.  I want my son to go out and play, like any other child.  I want to have to ring him to tell him to come home as it's late, like any other parent, and not to sit at home with him watching to see if his mood is tipping and have to shadow him in case he tries to harm himself.  I am asking this committee to help my son.  I am asking the committee to help every child in our country presenting with these issues.  Today I am asking the members of the committee to think, \"What if this was my child?\"  What can we do to help this child?  How can we move forward? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Dalton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I have three boys.  We had no problems.  I had three perfectly normal kids who were very intelligent, high achievers and very good in school.  One of them won the south-east maths challenge.  He is very brainy.  The other guy was awarded for his abilities in Irish.  I never had any bother with my kids.  I want to show the committee a photo of them.  They are brazen, good kids.  They play hurling.  One is a boxer and the other fellow does MMA.  We are just a normal family.  I did not have any of the problems that the girls have had, thank God.  Then, in October 2015 my partner died suddenly of a heart attack.  Our world was rocked.  It was swept from under our feet.  I had been a special needs assistant for almost eight years.  I had been made redundant and in the meantime I got a job working in Revenue.  I was due to start in Revenue the week after my partner died, but I had to postpone it.<\/p><p>I started after two weeks.  My kids were back in school.  We had to rebuild our lives after my partner died.  I wanted to try to get a normal life back so that they had a good foundation in everything.  I went to work and we did our best to get by.  In January I found out my eldest son who was in fifth year had been going to school but he had been coming home every day about 11 a.m. or 11.30 a.m. and getting into bed.  He could not cope with life.  He could not cope with school.  He was suffering with severe depression brought on by grief after losing his dad.  I took some time off work and brought him to the doctor.  The doctor rang the nurses 24-hour suicide helpline but he was too young to be helped.  He was just after turning 17 so he was not eligible for the service.  The doctor said that he should do exercise, do everything.  We followed all the advice.  He played sport and we did everything but it was not working so we went back to the doctor and the doctor and I begged him to please present himself in accident and emergency as he was suicidal.  He wanted to die as he could not go on.  We told him that the only way to get access to the services was to go to accident and emergency because there was a ten to 12 week waiting list for CAMHS and he just could not wait.  We went three times to accident and emergency.  He was put on Prozac and quetiapine, an anti-psychotic drug.  He was 17 years of age and he was put on drugs that have warnings on them that children should not be on them as they increase the risk of suicide.  He was put on those drugs and we were sent home.  Things went from bad to worse.  I could not go back to work.  I had to take time off work.  My other two children were watching that.  They were 13 and 14 at the time.  They had just lost their father and they were at risk of losing their eldest brother at this stage as well.  That was the reality.  We had a double grave and there was a good chance we were going to use it in six months.<\/p><p> The fourth time my son had gone out, he had about five pints.  It was March.  He was 17 and he had a few drinks.  He came home and he was as happy as Larry.  He got a Chinese takeaway.  That night everything fell apart for him.  He told me he had a noose in the shed and he had tried to hang himself a couple of times.  That night he said he could not take it anymore and he begged me to let him die.  He pointed to a guy on the street who had alcohol issues and he said to please let him die as that was all he had ahead of him.  He said he had nothing ahead of him only to be a drug addict or an alcoholic.  He said if I loved him I would let him die.  I rang the Garda and I rang an ambulance that night.  The Garda came after about half an hour and my two sons were out on the road watching for the Garda to show them where we lived.  I was physically restraining a 17-year old boy.  My brother and my father had come to the house at this stage to try to help me.  He had broken up the bathroom.  He had put his head through his bedroom wall.  He was trying everything to get the pain out of his head and nothing would work.  He said he had done everything I had asked him and everything the doctors had asked but nobody could help him.  He said he just needed to die.  He said I would get on way better and the lads would be way better if he was not in our lives.  He said we would soon realise that the best thing for this family was for him to die.<\/p><p> When the garda&iacute; arrived at the house I was physically restraining him on the couch in the sitting room because he was trying to get out to the shed and he was trying to get access to a knife in the kitchen.  I had my arms wrapped around him trying to hold him, trying to stop him killing himself.  The garda&iacute; came.  They asked what I wanted them to do about it.  I said I wanted them to help me save my son's life.  I said I called them to help me save my son's life, that I could not do it on my own.  I asked where the ambulance was.  They said there was no ambulance coming for him.  They asked what I wanted an ambulance for and that they would bring us to accident and emergency and drop us off.  I said \"no\", that I had been to accident and emergency three times and that he could not sit there anymore, that he could not do it.  The garda&iacute; refused to ring an ambulance for me so I sent my 15-year old out to the hall and I asked him to ring the ambulance.  Eventually, the garda&iacute; said they would get an ambulance for me.  They told me that if my son continued they would arrest him, so I had to ask them to leave my house.  In the end, they stayed as I think they realised what was going on.  We were basically being labelled as a mother who has a brazen teenager who would not do as she says.  That is how I felt that day.  They asked me what he had taken and what he had been on.  I said he was not on anything.  I said he was suicidal and he was suffering from grief.<\/p><p> We went to accident and emergency that night when the ambulance came.  My son, a fit and healthy 17-year old who was supposed to line out and play a hurling match the following day was brought in on a stretcher and wheeled catatonic into accident and emergency from an ambulance that night but he was alive.  We spent that night in accident and emergency.  I sat in the waiting room watching all the ads, such as \"It's ok not to be ok\", \"Ask for help\" and \"Tell someone\".  That is absolute rubbish.  There was nothing there for us when we went looking for it.  It is a complete and utter contradiction and it is hypocritical.  There was nothing there.  We had been everywhere looking for help.<\/p><p> My son spent the night in accident and emergency.  On Saturday at 9 a.m. he was brought down to the adult psychiatric ward.  He was told that he would not be allowed to leave his room because he would be in danger from other patients there.  He said he was not staying locked up in that place.  I begged him to stay.  He got up and he ran out of the hospital.  There was a big lock-down.  All the alarms were put on in the psychiatric ward.  He slammed his head off a concrete wall and he was brought into a padded room.  He turned around and he said, \"Do you believe it.  It is like Bobby Sands' room in here.\"  He was a 17-year old boy whose father had died and that was what we got.  He was in that padded room.  They asked me to leave so they could calm him down.  I left.  I came back an hour or two later and he had been given a room.  There was no staff.  They had nobody to mind him.  He was in danger from other psychiatric patients.  They had to get an agency nurse in to mind him and to sit with him 24\/7.  I had to bring him in pyjamas.  I had to take the cord out in case he hanged himself.  I had to take the cord out of the hoodie he got from Santa in case he hanged himself.  He was not allowed his bag.  It was locked away.  He was not allowed anything.  He went in on Saturday morning.<\/p><p> We only saw a doctor because he poured a cup of coffee over his head to show me that he hated the place so much and that if I did not take him home he would kill himself, so he was physically examined to make sure he had not damaged himself.  Thank God the coffee had cooled down enough so that he did not do any damage.  Basically, he was left in that room until Monday evening.  Nobody came to see him.  We were told there was no child psychiatrist in the hospital and there was nobody there to see him.  On Monday morning I asked what was going on and said he had to be seen by somebody.  I told the doctors that day that if I had known that this was what was going to happen I would have just hired a security man to come and sit in his bedroom because we would have been better off.  We waited all day for a child psychologist.  The child psychologist in Wexford hospital had to finish her rounds before she could come to Waterford.  There was no one to see him.  I asked where the doctor was and she was upstairs on another ward seeing another patient.  I was raging.  I asked how any other patient in the hospital was more important than my son who had been in there since Friday night in the acute area of an adult psychiatric ward on lock-down.  I asked who in the hospital was more important than him that he or she was seen before him.  We had waited all weekend.  At about 7.15 p.m the psychologist eventually came.  I asked what they were going to do but I was told there was nothing they could do but that I had the option of sending him to Cork or Galway.  I could not believe it.  They were telling me to send my son to Cork or Galway, that he could go to a adolescent care centre there for psychiatric problems.  I asked them how they seriously expected me to be a parent in Waterford and a parent in Cork or Galway at the same time.  I could not do it, financially, physically or in any other way.  The option I had was to leave him in the hospital.<\/p><p>I was told it would take about two weeks to get a place for him and that I could leave him in the acute psychiatric ward in Waterford until a place became available or I could take him home.<\/p><p> I took my son home that night, knowing full well he might not make it but I could not leave him in that ward a minute longer.  We went home on his promise that the next time he wanted to kill himself he would tell me about it so I would help him get through it.  The threat was that if he did anything behind my back he was going back into the ward.  We went home and I sat in his room night after night.  I took him off all the medication and I minded him myself, with my family, and we got through it.  We went to private counselling and we got through it.<\/p><p> He tells me he will never ever get over being in that ward, and that it did more damage than anything ever done to him in his life.  He is fine now.  He asks me how I could do it to him.  Now he is out of it everything is okay and he knows I had nowhere else to go.  I trusted a health service that was supposed to be there, that advertises everywhere to get help and to come to it and it will help, but there is nothing.  To be honest, I would not advise any parent, no matter how bad the child is, to put him or her in an adult psychiatric ward.  It is the worst thing ever.  I brought him home knowing I might lose him, but if I had a choice of that or leaving him there that is the choice I made.<\/p><p> He telephoned me from the hospital when I went home one night and he begged me to speak to his brothers.  I asked him what he wanted to say and he said he needed to say goodbye because he would not be there the following day.  I told him I could not leave him do that.  He told me I could not deny him the chance to say goodbye to his two brothers.  He told me he could not survive another night in there.  That is what we went through.<\/p><p> We are, in a sense, everybody sitting here.  Anybody sitting here could lose his or her partner in the morning.  Their life could change.  We are anybody.  We are the children picked up and ferried to GAA matches.  We are everybody.  We are a normal family who looked for help.  We have suffered enough.  I buried my partner.  They carried their father's coffin.  That is what he had to go through and that was the help we got.  Last week, when I told him I was doing this he told me he hoped the people here realise how hard this is, because this is not my story this is my son's story.  It is easy for me to speak because I did not go through what he went through.  Last week I told him if we can stop one other child going through what he had to live through something good will have come out of everything.  He told me if he had lived in any other family he would be dead and that he would have managed to kill himself.  I had great support.  My father, my brother and my in-laws were fantastic.  Other than that, my son would not be here.  He is fantastic.  He is doing an apprenticeship and he is absolutely brilliant again.  He is so aware of mental health now.  It is so important this is made into law.  It cannot happen to anyone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I am little choked up after hearing these ladies' stories.  Unfortunately, I also have many stories which are quite similar and sad.  I thank everybody for inviting me here this morning.  It is a great honour.  I am the chairperson of Dublin city and county CAMHS carers forum.  We come up with ideas and suggestions on improving the service.  As part of this I attend a monthly management meeting.  At present, our goal is to run coffee mornings to support parents and carers because when our children are not well we go through an awful lot ourselves.  It is a constant battle for us.<\/p> <p>  Through this, we have found issues in the service, which I will run through quite quickly.  There are waiting lists and waiting times to access the service.  There is a lack of autism services.  There is a gap for people who have mental health issues but who are not severe enough to be seen by CAMHS.  In the Dublin north county area there are no primary care psychology centres.  There is a lack of professional expertise in CAMHS and not every discipline is available on every team.  There is a difficulty recruiting and retraining staff.  Many locum and temporary staff work on each team, which leads to staff turnover.  This has an enormous impact on our young children who have to start all over again with new therapists and have to tell their story all over again.  I have no words for the placement of children in adult psychiatric wards.  The young person has so much going on already.  I cannot even begin to imagine the impact this has on young people and their family.  There is also a huge concern for those aged between 18 and 25 in mental health services.  We need to look at having a youth mental health service for this age bracket.  It is a huge transition to go from a child service to an adult service.<\/p> <p>  As I am the chairperson of the carer's forum I have some letters and stories of real-life situations of what parents cope with, some of which I will share.  I find them all moving and I have my tissues to hand.<\/p> <p>  One family has a very active suicidal 16 year old boy at home and they have been so fearful of his safety that they have had to take him to the accident and emergency department.  As he is 16 this is at an adult hospital, which is very scary for an adult never mind a young person.  They get referred to CAMHS.  They then get their son home from hospital after having the talk from the doctor about safety issues, such as locking away tablets, making sure no knives are left out and making sure there is nothing he can put around his neck or anything with which he can harm himself.  They safeproof their home and then they wait as the vigil starts.  They continually watch out and no one sleeps.  Siblings and family are in turmoil with it all.  They are trying to help him stay alive.  They are the last hope trying to do the job, the resuscitating and the ventilator, keeping him safe for goodness knows how long, to try and get the help he so desperately needs.  Every day feels like a lifetime.  Every night is endless.  \"Just keep him alive\" they keep telling themselves.  Everyone says to ask for help when someone does not feel in a good place but when people do it is not there.  Their lives are on hold.<\/p> <p>  Another parent who wrote had to leave a &euro;660 a week professional job that the person loved to take what is described as a &euro;300 a week horrible job in a supermarket to be at home at the same time as the person's daughter, who was waiting for the service.  The person was afraid to leave her at home alone.  That decision will impact that person and the family for ever.  It is not exactly a decision that can be explained on a CV.  That parent stated immediate and local services would save lives and children do not shut down for the weekend.  The service from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, is definitely an issue.<\/p> <p>  Another family wrote to say they had a 15 year old son who was suicidal and came to them after putting a knife to his throat.  He cried for hours and did not want to live due to bullying at school and the pressures of fifth year.  They got an urgent referral to CAMHS.  He was walking the floors every night and they had him on 24 hour watch.  They telephoned CAMHS daily they were so worried.  A week later they got an appointment for three month's time.  Their son was still suicidal and they had not slept, making sure he was okay.<\/p> <p>  Another parent wrote to say hers is not quite the usual story.  Her husband took ill last October and by the end of November they knew he was terminal.  Both her children have ASD, ADD and dyspraxia as well as some medical issues.  She tried to get advice from the service on how to tell the children about their father.  She left messages to telephone urgently but could not get past reception.  Eventually her husband had to go into a hospice where the medical social worker also tried to make contact.  The service eventually got back to her, which took a couple of weeks, but by the time it did it was too late.  Her husband passed away in April and she was sent an appointment for 4 July, which was too late.<\/p><p>Another parent noted how they could never stop watching them or ever relax.  They felt isolated and wished that someone could do something to help them.  If not, they felt, their kids would die.  They feel our children should be our priority.<\/p><p> A 36 year old man is trying this best to go to work with his daughter very unwell.  He is fighting to try to get support for her.  His relationship with his wife has also been very strained with the stress of the situation and he now knows what depression is.  He felt extremely down one of the days, at his lowest point, and his little girl came over to him, grabbed his hand and said, \"Daddy, you are very strong\".  He said that, if anybody ever needed to say that to him at that moment in time it was his daughter.  She could see how much distress he was in over her sibling.<\/p><p> Another parent wrote that their 13 year old daughter was currently on the priority waiting list for the local CAMHS.  They said the relief of seeing the words \"priority waiting list\" felt so good and hopeful that they rang CAMHS to find out what it actually meant.  They were told they were looking at months on this waiting list for their young child, who had a moderate to severe mental health issue, because that is the criterion to get onto that waiting list.  They asked how they ended up where they were.  Their daughter had, over the past 12 months, become very withdrawn and slowly started to lose interest in pretty much everything.  In the past three months they have found it very hard to get her to do anything or go anywhere.  Simple tasks like getting up and getting dressed seem to be too much for her.  As a family they tried very hard to encourage her to join in any social events in the community.  However, this resulted in their home becoming a breeding ground for tears and anger, instead of the loving, warm home it was and should be.<\/p><p> Now, the daughter has absolutely no interest in anything.  In the past few weeks, they came across letters that she wrote, with words like \"I want to say goodbye\", \"It's never going to change\", \"I am hopeless\", \"I don't want to do this anymore\", \"I feel invisible\", \"Nobody likes me\", \"Nobody cares\" and \"There is no point in living anymore\".  The parent has now had to leave their job as they cannot be at work and not know if their daughter is safe and alive.  They asked me to imagine what it would be like if my child had thoughts like that every single day, and to picture the waiting list and the prospect of sitting there for months.  They feel constantly in a crisis, like they are not living any more but just trying to get through each minute, hour, day as best they can.  It feels like all their lives are on hold and they are on constant watch with their daughter.  They do not know if they or their daughter can get through this.  She desperately needs help and support but she is on a priority waiting list.  They hope they do not run out of time as they are scared.<\/p><p> Another person speaks of having personal experience of a daughter attempting suicide.  She had collapsed at home and was going in and out of consciousness.  The parent had to take her to the emergency department with no idea of whether she would survive.  The parent held her hand, full of fear of what was to ahead.  The daughter could have died that day.  She needed help but so did the parent.  She was not doing this for attention but to end her life.  They were referred to CAMHS and had to wait two weeks for that appointment, two weeks that seemed endless.  They had to have her on 24-hour watch for that time and went into crisis coping mode, just getting by, doing everything they possibly could for their daughter but not being able to even think straight.  They were isolated and alone.  They had to back away from any volunteer work within the community as they just could not focus or function.  Looking back at that now, this parent still wonders how they got through that time.  They cannot imagine how parents can live like that for months when they struggled for those two weeks.<\/p><p> I was contacted by two other parents recently.  It breaks my heart to read these letters.  I have had my own personal experience and I know how hard this is.  One parent had a four year old, the other a five year old child, and both are having suicidal thoughts.  They do not qualify for CAMHS because they are too young.  I cannot imagine what it is like for the parents - it is so sad.  There should not be a waiting time of months for families such as these.  It is wrong and unfair.  Mental health issues are so hard for a family to cope with and it is crazy that a vulnerable young person has to wait months to be seen.  Their lives are put on hold as they go into survival mode.  Our young people matter and they are our future.  The situation needs to change as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McGee","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I am Martina from Sligo.  We are a family of four.  My husband is Liam.  We have two sons, aged 21 and 17.  We adopted our second son 14 years ago when he was three, from Belarus.  Adopting was a very difficult path that took five long years of assessments and social workers.  We loved him from day one and have always done our best for him.  When our son started national school, aged five, his teachers noticed that he had difficulties.  He was hyperactive and could not sit still.  He was overboisterous and exceptionally noisy.  He constantly spoke out of turn and was very disruptive.  Playing in the school yard became a big problem and in the classroom he made teaching and learning very difficult for everyone.<\/p> <p>  Our school referred us to the HSE and through the school's help and persistence we finally got an appointment for our son to see a child psychologist.  Over a period of two years she assessed him and eventually reported that he had severe ADHD.  The psychologist then referred him to CAMHS.  We were told that once we started attending psychiatry we could no longer avail of psychology.  We would like our son to have availed of both services as we feel he has both psychiatric and psychological problems.<\/p> <p>  Over the following seven years our son was seen once every six months by a different psychiatrist at each visit so we could not build up a relationship with any psychiatrist.  At every appointment, none of the psychiatrists talked to our son.  They checked his height, weight and blood pressure and we were always asked if we wanted to increase his medication.  Every time I tried to discuss his problems I was told it was behaviour.  They offered no advice and no help.  Finally, in the past two years we have built up a relationship with a part-time temporary psychiatrist who has stayed and will stay until a full-time permanent psychiatrist is, hopefully, found.  This part-time psychiatrist talks to our son and does not worry about his height or his weight.<\/p> <p>  ADHD has created enormous difficulties in our family, our home, our community.  Our son never thinks of consequences.  He does not comprehend dangers and he enjoys dangerous behaviour.  He is a risk-taker who craves excitement and his mind is constantly on overdrive, racing off in very unexpected directions.  He is very intelligent and sporty but he cannot stick with anything.  He was a great Irish dancer who won many trophies and medals and various feiseanna over several years.  He was a great rugby and soccer player and he enjoyed horse riding and surfing.  Sadly, he has abandoned all these activities.  He gets bored and frustrated very easily.  This leads quickly to agitation and anger, and sometimes violence.  He does not like his life being so chaotic.  He attends all his appointments, takes his daily medication and engages in every help offered to him.  In June 2016 he did a very good junior certificate.  Unfortunately, he refused to go back to school in September.  In autumn 2016, we tried to get him into various courses but he could not stick with any of them.<\/p><p>He was restless and rudderless, with no school structure or routine.  He started staying away from home for two or three nights, with no contact with us.  He would not reply to texts or answer calls.  He started drinking alcohol and experimenting with drugs.  He became friends with men and women in their 20s who were all eight to ten years older than him.  We did not know these adults.  We did not know where they lived.  It was very worrying and frightening for us.<\/p><p> Our son's life started to spiral out of control from November 2016 to May 2017.  During this period, he was found unconscious on town streets overdosed on either alcohol or drugs.  He did not care if he lived or died.  He was hospitalised on several occasions.  During this period, we were in constant contact with CAMHS and Tusla begging for help.  In spring 2017, Tusla held a multidisciplinary meeting for all parties to get involved in an in-depth discussion about our son's problems and how best to help him and us.  A week later, we were asked to meet our son's social worker and the senior social worker.  After a lengthy discussion, we were told their big solution was for us to go home and to try not to fight.  We left that meeting feeling deflated, disappointed, disgusted.  After this meeting, things got worse for all of us.<\/p><p> During the first week of May 2017, our son tried to take his own life on several occasions.  On the bank holiday Sunday, he took a drug overdose.  He was rushed to hospital.  On the Tuesday night, he went into respiratory failure.  He was rushed to hospital.  On the Saturday night, he jumped in front of a car.  He was taken to hospital.  On the next Sunday, he took an overdose of non-prescribed household medicines.  We took him to hospital.  All this happened within seven days.  All these traumatic situations occurred at weekends or night times when we could not contact CAMHS or Tusla.  The emergency department did not know what to do with our son.  On some of these occasions, he was kept under 24-hour watch because he was a danger to himself and others.  On one of these occasions, he was left sitting in the emergency department for 13 hours without any help.  On another occasion, we were told we would have to wait at least 12 hours before he could be seen by a doctor so I brought him home and sat watching him for 24 hours.  During this crisis week, I rang CAMHS and Tusla crying for help.  I asked for him to be admitted to a secure mental institution or strict high-dependency residential care for his own safety.  I was told by CAMHS and Tusla that they had nothing to offer us.  We were told there are very few beds for teenagers with mental health problems.  We were told that even if they found him a bed there was no guarantee he would stay as they could not force him to stay.  He would be free to walk out any time he wanted.  This was the worst week of our lives after six horrendous months of living through a nightmare and no one could help us.<\/p><p> Five weeks ago, he started a Youthreach programme.  He plans to do the leaving certificate applied through Youthreach over the coming two years.  He has stopped taking drugs.  He is trying to cut back on alcohol.  He attends a drug and alcohol addiction counsellor weekly.  He is making every effort to take control of his life but we fear for his future.<\/p><p> As in our case, most incidents occur in the evenings, at night time or at weekends when Tusla or CAMHS cannot be contacted.  Several times in the past six months we have had to call in the Garda at night time when we should have been calling a social worker.  Garda&iacute; are not trained social workers, psychologists or psychiatrists but they are expected to be all three when a crisis occurs at night or on weekends.  In our experience, we have found most garda&iacute; to be excellent mediators and very helpful and understanding, especially our local garda&iacute; who know us and our history.<\/p><p> After many years of asking for our son to have a psychological assessment, we finally got the assessment done in June 2016 while our son was also doing his junior certificate.  In autumn 2016, the psychologist told us she had completed the assessment and she would forward the results.  To date, after waiting 12 months, CAMHS, Tusla or ourselves have never received any assessment report.  In the nine years we have been attending CAMHS, our son has never had a psychiatric assessment.  We, his parents, believe our son has psychiatric and psychological problems along with severe ADHD.  Due to a lack of both funding and staffing, we find it very difficult to get answers.  Our son is crying out for help so I ask the committee, \"Who do we turn to for help, especially at night and on weekends?\"  I have just one last thing to say.  Yesterday, we attended a multidisciplinary meeting in Sligo.  Every organisation and service was represented, except CAMHS.  CAMHS had no one to send to our meeting.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting me to speak and for listening to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I thank Martina.

That is something we need to focus on because, from listening to the witnesses, it is out of hours - after 5 p.m. and at the weekends - that they find there is a lack of services, a lack of co-operation or a lack of staff to be able to see to the needs of their sons and daughters and the many children who are affected unfortunately by mental health issues.

Parents have to sleep beside their teenage son or daughter 24-7 to keep the child safe.  I do not think that is acceptable.  The financial cost of speeding up the process to try to get help involves losing one's mortgage and putting one's house at risk.  There is not just the financial cost but there is also a cost in terms of lives not lived in that happiness should be at the core of the child's life and he or she should experience the world around them.<\/p><p> The other observation is that a United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, report came approximately two weeks ago which stated that of 37 nations, Irish children aged between 11 and 15 are at the second highest in terms of saying they have emotional issues on a weekly basis.  That is fairly stark and it sends a message to us all.

We were put on that waiting list for 18 months.  Two months into the wait, she developed anorexia and suicidal thoughts.  As a result of that delay, she unnecessarily had to battle anorexia for over a year, purely because it was not a proactive approach, but reactive, which is the same in all the cases mentioned here today.  That is a big thing that I need to stress coming here.  It is very reactive, and even at that, there is barely a reaction.  People are shouting and screaming but no one is listening.

She should have had it a long time ago when we were first referred for assessment of need, but because we were hopped from one waiting list to another, after two and a half years, she had her first appointment.  I was sitting outside waiting for her, and I was flicking through a magazine.  I came across this fabulous article about a website the HSE has.  It is called <i>informingfamilies.ie<\/i>and it is fantastic.  All the information is there.  Parents do not know about it.  Professionals dealing with this do not know about it.  The amount of information on that website is unbelievable.  It is a huge resource.  One can tell much work has gone into it.

The disability team could organise something as simple as peer support, a sibling group, for example, if CAMHS had one room free on a Wednesday morning every two weeks, or every month.  Ms McGee mentioned that a coffee morning is coming up where she is based.  That support for parents to connect and bounce ideas off one another would help.

He is a delight and he does benefit from treatment and services.  The disability services and CAMHS should come together and talk about this child and other children.  They are so busy passing the buck between one another that this little child is falling between the cracks.  It is getting worse and a lot of time and money is being wasted.

There is no point in telling a parent to bring the child to the accident and emergency services.  We were there too many times and on the third occasion there was a group of young fellows around my son's age and one of them had got hurt playing hurling or football.  My son should have been one of those but he was there for a different reason.  He could not sit in accident and emergency.  He had to sit outside and he said he could not cope because he was not able for it.  He could not cope with the people.  He sat outside in the cold.  I told the nurse we were outside the door.  She did her best.  She tried to accommodate us and she brought us into the family room to wait.

It could even be only a room where a parent could sit with his or her child and make a cup of tea and not be judged by people who are in with broken legs or all the other traumas that one sees in accident and emergency.  That is hard to cope with at the best of times but for someone aged 17 who is trying to kill himself, that is not the place to be.  Every hospital in the country should have a crisis centre, not just for children but for adults as well.  If the parents are told they have to wait four or five hours for the on-call doctor to come to see the child, there should be a safe place to sit, next to security, to keep their child safe and to be safe themselves as well.

Maybe that is not an issue for CAMHS but for the HSE to provide psychology services within the community.  There are no psychology services for children younger than 18 in north county Dublin.  We need more staff.  Many of the staff in CAMHS who I have been involved with are temporary or locum staff.  Recently, they lost a really good psychiatrist who was a locum for two years and who wanted a permanent contract but there was none.  They are caught up in unnecessary paperwork and more children are then put at risk.  That needs to change.<\/p> <p>  It is important to include every discipline on the team.  In my local CAMHS, there was no dietician.  There might have been one in another CAMHS but one does not go between the services.  One has to stay with the service in one's location.  That needs to change.<\/p> <p>  Access 24 hours a day, seven days a week is very important.  I had to take my daughter who is 18 into accident and emergency because she had taken a serious overdose.  She had to have an antidote through her arm and sat on a plastic chair for 21 hours while getting it.  For three of those hours she was vomiting severely into a bag.  She was 17.  She should not have been sitting in an adult accident and emergency hospital.  These children are vulnerable and it is very hard as a parent to watch that.  At one stage they gave me another plastic chair, and then they had to take it away so I had to stand beside her.  That is no place for a young person going through a trauma.  They are not attempting suicide for attention.  They are not well people and they need help and support, not to be put into a more stressful environment.  In one of the letters I mentioned, the parents spoke of the relief they felt when they got a letter to say their daughter was on a priority waiting list.  They rang their local CAMHS to see what that meant.  That means months.  Priority should be a couple of weeks.  It is such a stressful situation for a parent, watching their child 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It is unfair to the whole family unit.  That needs to be reduced to weeks at most.<\/p><p>It is unfair to the entire family as a unit.  It is too hard.  That needs to be reduced to weeks at most.

They will extend even further and I hope will be run every month.  It is a place where parents can sit down either with me or other parents and where they do not feel isolated.

We should teach the parents to teach the children coping skills.  The parents could do it at home and the children could do it once a month in school.

It is as important as referring someone with a heart attack or some other physical disability.  That is frustrating.  However, GPs do not do it lightly but out of necessity.  That is one topic that illustrates a fundamental flaw in the system.<\/p> <p>  I agree there is an over-reliance on medication.  Medication is not always the answer.  It is part of the answer but we need to emphasise and concentrate our efforts on psychological support, be it cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, or whatever.  I refer to Zara and her therapeutic horse riding.  Another important point is that as medics we rely too much on medication.  I want that to be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  My heart goes out to Louise and her eldest boy, a 17 year old who found himself in an adult mental health ward as a result of a severe reaction to the loss of his dad.  It is a very sad story and disgraceful that he found himself in an adult mental health ward.  It emphasises that it is imperative for all Senators to support Senator Freeman's Bill which will amend the current Mental Health Act to make it illegal for young people and children to be placed in adult mental health wards.  I would be happy to support that Bill.<\/p> <p>  It is also worrying that, out of desperation, families are forced to seek private counselling and spend huge sums of money because they cannot access that service through the public health system.  That is another example of a failing system.<\/p> <p>  We need to get away from this crisis management.  Do the witnesses believe that more investment in community-based services in the primary care setting might help alleviate the situations they described, for example, providing all these services in primary care centres?  We hear a lot of talk about primary care centres.  I always say that primary care centres are not just about the bricks and mortar but the activity that happens within the centres.  This is an open question and is not to anyone in particular.  Do the witnesses believe that more investment in that sector could help prevent the crisis management we see taking place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#L01400","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming to the committee.  A number of Senators have been in the House for about one year and this is the most profound sitting I have attended.  I extend a special thanks to Senator Joan Freeman for really opening our eyes.  We need to shine a big light on this issue.  A first cousin of mine committed suicide some years ago, but it still did not dawn on me well enough until Senator Freeman shared her experiences.  The representatives present are warriors and they are great people.  These Houses and this country has let them down, but with people such as Senator Freeman, however, and with the inspiration given by her and the others in the room today, please God it will not happen for much longer.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Senator Kelleher had some very good and focused questions on where we should go from here.  The representatives' views in this regard are very helpful.  Moving on from here and following on from a comment by Senator Devine, where are the fathers and what are the roles of the fathers?  I know that Louise's partner has passed away.  I realised from this that something can be triggered in the mind.  A person's mind is triggered and he or she goes off in a particular direction and into a deep hole.  That person feels that no one can pull him or her out from the deep hole.  That was a learning curve for me and it is very important.  The role of fathers in all this is one aspect, other than in Louise's situation, understandably.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by how long people have been waiting for an assessment or the results of an assessment.  People go for their assessments and then nothing happens.  One part of the situation is that the system is badly broken, and the witnesses have suggested how we might look at repairing the system.  The other part of the situation is that we do not have a system and there is no joined-up thinking whatsoever.

It is not easy to do that.<\/p> <p>  I am struck by three things.  There is no joined-up thinking or uniformity of approach, as Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has said.  Let us consider having to engage with a different psychiatrist or psychologist on every visit.  For adults that would be bad enough, but it is harder for a young and vulnerable teenager or child who is trying to develop trust or a relationship.  My first query relates to the issue of joined-up thinking.  I listened to the comments about Tusla and CAMHS.  What should we do in respect of having joined-up thinking?<\/p> <p>  My next question is around funding.  In the 2017 HSE budget, &euro;853.1 million is allocated to mental health, a 3% increase from 2016.  It is 6.1% of the budget.  If parents, those who need, use, depend upon and co-exist with the system, have a blank canvas, how do we spend that money?  I am conscious that Lauren spoke of waste in the system.  What should we spend that money on?<\/p> <p>  I have read the presentations and heard the powerful and moving testimony of the witnesses here today.  Given that we have created Tusla, the child and family agency, and we have CAMHS, what should the committee tell Tusla and CAMHS arising from today's meeting?<\/p> <p>  My final question is in the context of Senator Freeman's Bill.  I listened to Louise's story.  When I attended college, I worked as a porter in Cork University Hospital.  I have also volunteered with different disability organisations.  Cork University Hospital has a wonderful new facility, built in place of the older ground floor facility, that I hope can offer hope to people.  Notwithstanding what Louise has said, and we all agree that young people should not be admitted to adult units, there is a view that the legislation, if it is enacted, will do more harm than good.  Would the parents be in favour of any flexibility in that type of situation?  If a young person, for example, was to present at an emergency department and no bed was available in the child facility, would there be flexibility?  I am conscious of Louise's situation and I fully understand what she did.  She did what any mother would do.  Her bravery should be commended today.  I am not patronising.  I am being honest because I know people in similar situations.  Given Louise's experience, when she was at her most desperate, should there be that flexibility around admissions?<\/p> <p>  I thank the parents so much.  I know it was not easy for them to come here today.  The eyes of the nation are watching.  They have given us not just information but also hope.  It is, as Senator Kelleher has said, about people.  Equally, if it can assist one other person to tell their story, then they have done a huge job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#M00600","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":753,"content":"<p>Who among the witnesses would like to address those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#M00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I will take the question about flexibility of admitting children to adult wards.  I would most definitely say \"No\".  There are enough empty rooms and enough empty beds in our hospitals.  An agency nurse could be put in a different room in each hospital.  My son was around alcoholics and drug addicts etc.  I do not mean to label anyone else in society but if a child feels at his or her lowest, feels worthless, useless and that society and their families are better without them, it is difficult if the child is placed in an adult ward.  My son came out of there believing this was what he was.  He believed his future was to be the same as the adults with all those mental health problems.  The only thing he got from that was a firm belief that this was going to be him in ten years if he did not manage to commit suicide in the meantime.<\/p><p>I firmly believe that putting him in there caused more damage.  One would not put a child with a kidney infection, particularly a little girl, in a ward with old men.

They deserve to be treated fairly.  They have done nothing wrong.  They are blameless.  They did not ask for their illness and they need to be treated in the same way as every other child, namely, in a paediatric ward, where there are lovely paintings on the walls and balloons and toys in the corridors outside them.  My son was surrounded by alcoholics and other people who were a danger to him and themselves.  Under no circumstances would I say there is any excuse for doing that to a child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I am also on the autistic spectrum.

At the time, I could not communicate emotions because I did not understand them.  It was the worst place for me at 21 years old, never mind a child as vulnerable as the children about whom we are speaking.  I agree with what has been said in this regard.<\/p> <p>  In regard to waste, the question on the community centre and Senator Buttimer's question on how money is spent, including the 3% increase in 2016, in December 2013, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, on a visit to Japan visited Toyota to learn about Lean methodology, which for those who are not familiar with it is a programme related to eliminating waste, adding value and keeping in processes only those things that add value or have to be in place for compliance.  None of the information he got from Toyota has been introduced here.  Why not?  In terms of our service, we adhere to lean methodology in terms of the elimination of waste.  This will not happen over night there can be a lot of quick wins.  We can make a difference by eliminating waste but to do that we need full staff.

At seven years old Reese was presenting with issues not typical in autism.  I could see the problem was escalating but when I requested intervention nobody listened.  At that point he needed early intervention in the form of play therapy, which works well for him, and psychological and psychiatric therapy.  If interventions are made at an early stage it helps to fix a problem before a child feels his or her life is over or ruined and thus one does not have to spend as much money and resources on the child at a later stage.  Art therapies and other similar therapies should be introduced because not only autistic children but all children respond well to visual therapies.  It is important intervention centres are child friendly.  I know from parents whose children are not autistic but are in need of intervention therapies that children are scared of going to these places if they do not appear child friendly.  They either shut down or they put brave faces on and pretend everything is okay but when the go home they have episodes and breakdowns.

I believe more needs to be put into the primary centres to prevent parents and children having to endure the trauma of accident and emergency departments and so that they do not have to wait weeks or months to access services.  If a child is taken to see a GP and is determined to be in difficulty he or she should get an appointment straight away rather than having to wait months for it.  This is important to a child who is feeling low and also his or her main care-giver.  When my daughter was ill, I kept my head above water and tried to remain brave and strong but it broke my heart that she was on a waiting list for treatment.  Access to quick treatment and help and support, including for parents to empower them to help their children, is key.  It will help to keep young people out of accident and emergency departments.<\/p> <p>  I also believe that a young person should never be put into an adult psychiatric ward.  Having to bring my daughter who is 17 years old to the accident and emergency department of an adult hospital was disgusting.  It was so unfair.  These children are so vulnerable.  Consideration should be given to Temple Street being responsible for children up to 18 years of age.  This would ensure they are treated in a protective environment.  I agree that there is a need for the introduction of a young adults mental health service because up to 25 people are still going through a transition.  They could be trying to settle into college or a new job but they are still trying to discover who they are.  While the adult mental health service is excellent, these people find it difficult to engage with a service that caters for people aged 30 years upwards.  It is a very different environment.

They would just be seeing the counsellor with all the other kids from their school with appointments.  It would be an easier way for a child to get help.  My son had very severe difficulty going to a counsellor.  He would not go when we had appointments made and he just told me he was not able to speak to a counsellor.  He was not at the stage he could do that.  Perhaps if he had been, he would not have been in such a crisis.  It is very hard even for adults to go to see a counsellor and it is a tough task.  We do not even have to put a name like \"counselling\" on this.  If we put a nice, happy name on it, the child could go to see someone in primary care in a safe environment beside a dentist, for example.  This would happen in the community and the person would not go to a hospital or where he or she would be labelled as someone with mental health issues.  It is a major fear kids have and they are afraid to say it because people will think they are mad or crazy.  It would be something to bridge the gap, a little stepping stone between being a normal Joe Soap and someone who ends up in an acute psychiatric ward.

Its members are not trained for this, although they do their best, and we are very lucky with our local garda&iacute;.  I give them great praise for the help they have given to my family.  It is not fair that garda&iacute; are called into these cases.  One evening we were desperate, but as we are from a rural area, the local garda&iacute; were not working and town garda&iacute; who did not know us were called in.  A big van arrived with six garda&iacute; with flak jackets jumped out.  One would have thought there was a hostage situation because our son was having a meltdown and had taken every tablet from our medicine cabinet.  They were non-prescription drugs but they were Anadin and Panadol, for example.  He swallowed the lot and we did not know who to call.  I thought we would get the local garda&iacute; but the call went straight to the town garda&iacute;.  Six of them arrived and jumped out, ready to attack.  One might have thought there had been an assault at our home.  I had to run out and stop them as the issue would have escalated.  I did not know any of the six garda&iacute; but I asked whoever was the calmest and best mediator to come in and speak to our son.  The other five stayed outside and did not know what to expect.  Within five minutes the entire issue was defused.  Instead of calling the ambulance, they brought him to hospital.  Things can get out of control very quickly and some people just do not know how to handle such cases.  None of us does, and if it is the first time for any of us, we are not trained and do not know what to do.

We definitely need more help in the community in order that there is not the same stigma with mental health.  Our teachers were a great help and spotted problems, but teachers are not trained to deal with mental health issues.  They should be given more training to deal with basic mental health issues to help children and us.  It is about losing the stigma of mental health.

We might see them vomiting and wonder about it but they have already acted.  Primary care is so important.  One should be able to go to a GP and be referred to primary care, regardless of age.  It should not matter.  If a person is having suicidal or self-harming thoughts and is not in a good place, it is the time to get help.  We should not wait until these young people do something.

I attend the management meeting for the Dublin north county and city CAMHS and they do everything.

They do not want people on waiting lists and they want to be able to take people in straight away, but there are no resources for that.  That must be examined.<\/p><p>The other part is that staffing should not be all locums and temporary staff.  If they have completed their trial period, they should be made permanent.  That would provide continuity for the young person and for us, so that we are not going in and meeting a brand new therapist every time.  With every new therapist, our children have to start all over again and go through their story from day one, where they have been, how they got here - it is just very unfair.  It is for young people.  Let us try to get them out of the mental health services and onto the road to recovery.  Primary care is definitely the way to go.  We need to put a lot of resources and money into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad McGee","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":771,"content":"<p>As regards how I would spend the money, to be perfectly honest, the way the HSE and health service is at the moment, we are losing all our staff.  It is happening everywhere.  In Waterford, we have the cardiac care problem.  We have no resources.  No one in their right mind would stay working in the HSE.  Unless wages are increased, we are going to lose the best people.  No one would stay working in a hospital that is understaffed, where there is a lack of resources and staff are not appreciated, when it is possible to go private and get paid probably twice as much with better conditions.  That is happening across the board in Ireland at the moment with our nurses, doctors and everyone.<\/p> <p>  It is not a case of just going out and hiring all these people.  We have to treat people properly or they will not come to work in the system.  That is my view of the underlying problem.  We are not paying people enough.  I would increase people's wages so they can work in our health system and do the job they went to college to train for and be paid properly.  They should not be falling asleep on their feet because they are stretched to the limit.  I see it myself working in the public service.  I would say the bill across the public service for people going out on stress-related illness is going to be colossal because there are not enough people working across the board.  That has to be changed before we can get the proper people in to work in mental health or anywhere else.  That is where I would spend the money.<\/p> <p>  Senator Freeman asked if we had any idea of what was going on beforehand.  I was shocked and disgusted and felt very let down.  I think more was spent advertising mental health services than providing them.  I sat all night and watched those advertisements on television.  There was nothing there.<\/p> <p>  I wrote to the head of the HSE in the south east area.  I told him what had happened, and how many times we had tried to access resources.  I had phoned CAMHS the week before my son ended up in the adult ward and told them that he was really bad.  We had an appointment for the following Monday and I asked them to bring forward his appointment.  They told me no, we had an appointment and we had to wait for it and that was that.  They did not have the resources to give him another appointment.  I turned up on Monday.  I left the psychiatric ward and went over for his appointment.  I said, \"Here I am.  My son is over there in the acute psychiatric ward and will not attend his appointment today.\"  That is the service I got.<\/p> <p>  When I wrote to the head of the HSE, the reply I got was a list of all the resources available - Squashy Couch, the TYRE Garda youth diversion project, all these wonderful places where I could have brought my son.  When a child is in crisis and is trying to get a knife in the kitchen to kill himself, a parent cannot say \"come on, let us head off and we will go to Squashy Couch or another place and we will have a little chat about your problems\".  That is not the answer.  The HSE tried to justify it by telling me the services were there and I did not access them.  I tried really hard to access the services.  Our doctor tried really hard to get us in.  We turned up three times in the accident and emergency department trying to skip the waiting list for CAMHS.  The resources are not there.<\/p> <p>  I would be very slow to recommend to anybody that they go through the HSE with their children's mental health.  I would tell them to beg, borrow and steal to get the money to go private, to pay a counsellor because they are gambling with their child's life if they go through this system.  The child might come out alive or he or she might not.  That is the reality of things for parents.  It just should not be happening in this day and age.  It is an absolute disgrace.  We give out about waiting lists everywhere but people are going to die.  It is down to a flip of a coin whether a child makes it out of it.<\/p> <p>  I had no idea how bad things were.  If I had not gone through it, I would think the other witnesses here were all exaggerating.  I genuinely would think they were just looking for a bit of drama.  We are all strong people.  There are people who are not as strong as us who are visiting graves and that is reality.  It is time that Ireland woke up and did something about this and stopped talking about it.  Put in the measures.  There are empty beds all over the country - start using them.  Open them up and put staff in place so that children can come in.<\/p> <p>  We should not have to rely on charities or people's goodness and kindness of heart.  I am going to Kilimanjaro on Monday for Pieta House.  We have raised nearly &euro;160,000.  I am not saying this because of Senator Freeman.  I am leaving my children for nearly two weeks.  In my family and my home, we have raised enough money to save eight lives.  I have raised over &euro;8,000 because of people's goodness.  I should not have to do that.  I should not have to take unpaid charitable leave from my job to go out there to make sure that no family goes through this again.  It is not fair and we should not be asking it.  I should not be going cap in hand begging the people of my town to give money to save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I am going to hear from two more witnesses.

We need to redirect resources into that.

They are outsourcing health.  They should employ people because they are paying so much more for outsourcing.  They are wasting really good money that could be put to use in the mental health services.  That is going on daily in every county.  I recently realised how much of it is going on in Waterford and I was shocked.  That is good money they are throwing away.  I do not mean the money they are spending on assessing the children.  If they would hire someone instead of outsourcing, they would save money in the long run.<\/p> <p>  Again in the hospitals, staff are not getting paid enough.  I agree they should be paid more.

They did not want to work in those conditions.<\/p> <p>  To answer Senator Freeman's question, I knew the situation was a little bit severe as regards mental health but I had no idea how bad it was.  I do not think people understand until they are going through it.  Much more awareness needs to be raised.  We need to highlight this.  I did not know, so how would anyone else know?  It is the vulnerable people who are suffering.  We need people to be more aware and we need to teach everyone.

I totally agree with Ms Dalton that outsourcing is a huge expense compared to employing a fully-staffed team to deal with the backlog.  The money could be pumped it into early intervention.  The problem is that there are barely any resources for early intervention and that is leading to a crisis situation.  We need to be proactive, not reactive.  As I mentioned, there should be investment into teaching children and parents how to implement coping skills.  It is easy to sit around talking about it, and all present know what coping skills are, but finding ways to implement them when needed is more difficult.<\/p> <p>  It is important not to waste time on big ideas.  The stuff in the strategic plan for my area for 2017 is so unrealistic.  Its first goal is to promote health and well-being as part of everything we do in order that people will be healthier.  The third goal is to foster a culture that is honest, compassionate, transparent and accountable.  Those goals are currently far out of reach.  They need to be realistic.  Money needs to go into delivering what people need now, getting the backlog up to date and then looking at how waste can be eliminated.  I do not know if any members know about lean six sigma training.  As I said, there is a training course in that on Groupon for &euro;26 that could make such a difference to the HSE.  It does not have to cost money.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of what should be told to Tusla and CAMHS, the first issue is that they need to be fully staffed, although that is more the function of the HSE.  Once that is in place, the organisations need to listen to parents and take accountability.  Tusla's child protection function has been shown to be deficient in several cases, with parents providing the only functional child protection.  Services need to be interlinked.  People cannot be passed from CAMHS to a disability team and then have to wait for another two and a half years.  That is not good enough.  The lack of interlinked services is creating a crisis.<\/p> <p>  I knew about mental health services because I had experience of mental health issues as an adult.  For children, I have no idea.  I thought it was brilliant when we got a letter saying that my daughter had been put on a waiting list because she had anorexia and was suicidal but we were then told there would be a further wait of 18 months.  I was not prepared for that.  I thought that my daughter would not still be with me in 18 months' time.  She had not eaten for four days by the time we went to get this letter saying she was on a priority waiting list.  I hope that answers everything.  I hope it helps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lauren Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keogh.

We are always happy to contribute to proceedings which can have a positive impact on the lives of the young people with whom we work.  I thank the committee for making it possible for a young person from our service, Ms Arianna Gallagher, to speak today as we in BeLonG To feel that it is extremely important to hear directly from the young people with whom we work and to give them an opportunity to share their voices on issues such as this.<br\/><br\/>Before I move onto the substance of my presentation, I would like to share a few things about the organisation I am representing today.  BeLonG To is a national lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and non-binary, LGBT youth organisation.  Our service is based here in Dublin but we also provide services across the country, which are vital supports for LGBT+ youth, including in the area of mental health.  We work with many Departments and other partners in order that Ireland's LGBT young people may live in a place where they are equal, safe and valued in the diversity of their identities and experiences.  <br\/><br\/>To achieve this vision we work with LGBT+ young people as equals in the context of three broad pillars.  The first pillar is the youth services which we provide through groups in which our youth workers work with young people on the basis of equal partnership.  The second pillar is about changing attitudes through our campaigns in support of young people being themselves and through giving them opportunities to talk about the lives and settings of themselves and their peers, such as the opportunity Ms Gallagher will have today.  The final pillar relates to research which enables us to shed light on the lived reality of what it is like to be a young LGBT+ person in Ireland today.<br\/><br\/>I will now share some statistics which are pertinent to today's discussions.  These come from a 2016 report by Dr. Agnes Higgins <i>et al<\/i>. entitled &quot;The LGBTIreland Report: national study of the mental health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people in Ireland&quot;.  This study was commissioned in part by BeLonG To and was funded by the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention.  This study raised a number of key issues in respect of LGBT+ youth.  First, it reinforced previous research which indicated the most common age for LGBT+ young people to become aware of their identities is 12, regardless of whether that identity is transgender or lesbian, gay or bisexual.  The most common age at which to come out was 16.  With respect to coming out, this represents a drop of one year in the average since the previous large-scale national study of lesbian, gay and bisexual people, which was carried out in 2009.  In respect of that period between 12 and 16 there is concern about how young people are coping with their identity and how they are beginning to accept it.  Having to hide that significant part of themselves from others can cause some difficulty, particularly with regard to mental health.  <br\/><br\/>Despite the encouraging fact that young people are coming out at an earlier age, there are still many difficulties which LGBT+ people can encounter in Irish society.  According to the research, 50% of LGBT+ students have personally experienced anti-LGBT bullying within their schools.  Those that had experienced bullying had higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress and alcohol use.  They were also 12% more likely to self-harm and 19% more likely to have attempted suicide.  In comparison with the general youth population, LGBT+ young people had twice the level of self-harm overall, so we are looking at something like 56% of LGBT young people aged 14 to 18 having self-harmed.  They also had three times the level of attempted suicide, which equates to approximately one in three 14 to 18 year olds, which is again quite a shocking statistic.  They also had four times the level of severe or extremely severe stress, anxiety and depression.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Mary McAleese, in launching the LGBTIreland report, said:<\/p><blockquote>this scholarly report is as essential and revealing as it is horrifying.  The ongoing damage is undeniable.  That it involves so many young people is tragic.  That it is soluble is the good news.<\/blockquote> <p>I would like to echo these words today, as the issues that LGBT+ young people face do have solutions.  We in BeLonG To have been working with partner organisations such as Jigsaw in the delivery of LGBT+ mental health training to professionals and with Pieta House in the provision of an in-house counselling service to LGBT+ young people who are experiencing issues around self-harm and suicidal ideation.  We are very grateful for their support.  <br\/><br\/>There are, however, many issues which need to be resolved.  Ms Arianna Gallagher, who is 15 and who has been in our service since last year, will now speak on some of the issues which young people who access our services face directly and the ways in which we, as an organisation, try to support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":785,"content":"<p>As young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, we are often dismissed by adults who say that we are only children and that we do not yet know what we are.  No one knows oneself better than oneself.  When we are disregarded and told that we cannot be this or that and that we must wait until we are older it can be very damaging to our mental health.  Even sometimes when we go to counselling services, for example, we may be told the same thing by adults who are supposed to be trained in these fields.  When we go to places such as BeLonG To, however - which has been of extreme benefit not only to myself but to hundreds of people who identify as LGBTI across the country - we are asked what name and pronouns we prefer and we are respected as equals.  There is no sense of them being adults and us being children.  We are respected.  People are referred to and spoken about as they wish to be and they are not judged for it.  We are surrounded by people who are in similar situations to ourselves and adults who have gone through similar situations and who respect us just as much.<\/p> <p>  The different BeLonG To groups such as BeLonG To Sunday, BeLonG To IndividualiTy and BeLonG To Ladybirds help different groups within the LGBT community.  The partnership which BeLonG To has with services such as Pieta House has also been of extreme benefit to the mental health of young LGBTQ people.  They know they have a place to which they can go where, if they share their problems from home or school whether about bullying or about something else, they will be respected and listened to and will not be turned away like they might be from other counselling services.  BeLonG To has seriously improved my mental health and I know for sure that it has helped the lives and improved the moods of hundreds of LGBT people across the country.  The number of teenagers walking at the front of the parade during the recent Pride festival just goes to show how proud we have become because we have something like BeLonG To, which teaches us that we can be proud to be who we are, that we should not be afraid to be who we are and that we should just be who we are without being afraid.<\/p><p>Without BeLong To, the mental health of the young LGBTQ population across the country would be a lot worse than it is at the moment because some of us live in areas where, let us say, it is still not accepted, or we go to schools where we would still get bullied over it.  We need BeLong To not only here in Dublin and in other counties but across the country.  Every single county should have its own service like BeLong To in order that those who live in remoter areas do not have to travel far to be who they are.  There should be a right to be who you are and to be respected for who you are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#AA00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Arianna Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gallagher for her contribution and for being brief as well.

I will share my time with my colleague, Ms Julie Helen.  As the Chairman said at the start, it is a very important topic.<\/p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland is a national, rights-based advocacy organisation that works to promote the rights of people with intellectual disabilities.  Our work is underpinned by the values of dignity, inclusion, social justice, democracy and autonomy.  Intellectual disability involves a greater than average difficulty in learning.  A person is considered to have an intellectual disability if their intellectual functioning is below average but also their adaptive skills may be below average and the condition is present from childhood.  Childhood is particularly important for people with intellectual disability.<\/p> <p>  Through our advocacy work and community engagement we have contact with people with intellectual disabilities and their family advocates on a daily basis and from all across the country.  We know that people with intellectual disabilities experience a higher instance of mental health difficulties than the general population.  There is much supposition and reasons out there as to why that might be the case but we know that people with intellectual disability are more likely to have difficulty with their mental health than the general population.  As recently as 2015, the Health Services Executive estimated that 25% of people with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities also experience mental health difficulties and if behavioural difficulties are included then up to 50% of people can experience that diagnosis.  As members can appreciate, that is a large number of children and adolescents.<\/p> <p>  The recent Health Research Board, HRB, statistics show that 35% of all people with intellectual disability are between zero and 19.  In a moment, my colleague, Ms Julie Helen, will talk about our community engagement work and some of the case studies that we have encountered.  I am aware that we use a lot of statistics and it is nice to be able to colour it with some case studies from the ground.<\/p> <p>  A Vision for Change has been set out but both the National Disability Authority and the Irish College of Psychiatrists have commented upon the fact that people with intellectual disabilities experiencing mental illness do not have their needs adequately met.  A Vision for Change is not new but it sets out a clear structure for how mental health services for children and adolescents who have an intellectual disability should be delivered.  In the policy's recommendations, children and adolescents with a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability should be seen in mainstream child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Children and adults with moderate to severe intellectual disability - that is not language we tend to use but they are the terms set out in the policy - should be seen by one of 15 mental health and intellectual disability, MHID, teams across the country.  We will see from the case studies what the experience is like on the ground, and what the mainstream experience has been for people as well.<\/p> <p>  Our efforts prior to the meeting to find up-to-date information on how many MHID teams have actually been established proved fruitless.  I do not know what the experience of other witnesses has been in that regard.  There is evidence that the numbers of teams is far below the recommended number in A Vision for Change.  In 2015 the Mental Health Commission reported that 12.95 adult MHID posts were under the auspices of or funded by the HSE.  Approximately 300 posts for adult MHID and 150 MHID posts for children and adolescents were recommended for child and adolescent mental health services in A Vision for Change.<\/p> <p>  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has an article devoted to children which states \"States Parties shall take all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children.\"  Similarly, Article 25 states \"States Parties recognize that persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability.\"  It is clear that were Ireland to ratify the convention, it would not be in compliance with these articles.  That is another one to add to the list of areas we have identified where we need to be in compliance before we ratify.<\/p> <p>  The case studies will also illustrate the difficulties that co-morbidity can provide.  Where a child or adolescent has intellectual disability and mental illness there is often no clarity over responsibility.  Children with autism are often excluded because anxiety issues are very common for those on the autism spectrum.  Those young people then fall through the cracks.<\/p> <p>  In a broader context there are practical things that can be done to improve the experience of mental health services for everybody, but for people with intellectual disabilities in particular.  In Inclusion Ireland we feel very strongly about accessible information.  More can be done in that regard.  We had a look at the Mental Health Commission's website and while I have a lot of respect for it, the only document in an accessible version on it available to people with intellectual disabilities is from 2010 and it was a code of practice for staff.  More could be done such as putting more information about mental health services, mental health tribunals and national standards in an easy-to-read format.  It is also important that information is available on how to make a complaint.

I will now detail some brief case studies so that the committee can get a flavour of our work on the ground with the community engagement team.<\/p> <p>  A parent in HSE Dublin north east requested the service of CAMHS.  Her daughter had self-harmed and had spoken of suicide.  CAMHS said it would not take the case as she was almost 17.  Adult services would not take the case as the child was not yet 18.  It was only due to a threat of a complaint under the Health Act that the child was seen.<\/p> <p>  The mother of a young boy in HSE Dublin north east required the services of CAMHS.  The boy self-harmed and on one occasion had such an episode of self-injuring behaviour that he had to be brought to an accident and emergency department.  He was referred to CAMHS, which would not offer him a service as his case was not deemed to be severe enough.  After going home, his mother was reduced to begging CAMHS for a social worker.<\/p> <p>  In separate cases, two teenage boys in HSE Dublin north east both began to engage in seriously challenging behaviour.  Their parents were referred to CAMHS, which would not offer either child a service as their intellectual disability was more than mild.<\/p> <p>  A parent in HSE Dublin mid-Leinster was referred to CAMHS as their 14-year old child was self-harming and had attempted to take their life.  CAMHS did not see the child as the case was seen as a disability issue rather than a mental health difficulty.  The child was inappropriately referred to the school guidance counsellor for help.<\/p> <p>  A social worker in HSE west contacted Inclusion Ireland when she referred a young boy of 13 to CAMHS.  The boy is out of school due to serious behavioural issues.  The professionals with whom the boy is engaged believe that there may be an underlying mental health issue.  CAMHS would not take the referral due to age grounds and disability grounds.<\/p> <p>  A mother in Cork contacted us when she could not get an appointment with CAMHS for her 11-year-old daughter who has anxiety issues and is on the autism spectrum.  The family has been waiting for one and a half years for support with the issue.<\/p> <p>  Services have been approached by families to provide information to young people with intellectual disabilities and mental health issues but there is a lack of accessible information in this area.<\/p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland has several recommendations that it would like the committee to consider.  Our key recommendation is to make sure that children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities are included in its deliberations on mental health.  We ask the committee to consider the case studies we have put forward and to consider children with all levels of disability regardless of the label they are given.<\/p> <p>  The 15 child and adolescent mental health and intellectual disability teams recommended in A Vision for Change need to be put in place and appropriately staffed by professionals with knowledge of both mental health and intellectual disability in order that people can get the support they need when they need it.<\/p><p>Clarity is needed on how children with intellectual disabilities and mental health difficulties are dealt with.  The pathways need to become clear in order that people know where to turn.  We must not forget those with mild intellectual disabilities.<\/p><p> Further support is needed for children and adolescents who have autism spectrum disorder as they too often fall through the cracks.  More inter-agency working and joined-up thinking is needed between the child and adolescent mental health services and disability services in order that waiting times can be reduced for children and adolescents.<\/p><p> Accessible information needs to be developed for children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities around how the mental health system works for them.  They have a right to information, which could be provided in an easy to read format and plain English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#BB00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Helen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Helen and invite Dr. Migone to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#CC00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":793,"content":"<p>I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Glenda Kavanagh, from the Lucena Clinic, which is one of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Dublin.  We cover a catchment area with a population of approximately 646,000.  Under A Vision for Change, we are supposed to meet the needs of the 2% of children with the most severe mental illness.  This includes, among other conditions, children with major mood disorders, psychosis, severe eating disorders and debilitating anxiety disorders.  This group of children requires specialist intervention.  The purpose of our attendance is to highlight the lack of staff in CAMHS when compared with the recommendations set out in A Vision for Change, the increase in referral numbers to our services and the lack of access to inpatient beds.<\/p> <p>  The Health Service Executive has indicated that increasing the age of referrals to child and adolescent mental health services to 18 years will increase the works for CAMHS teams by 100% because rates of mental illness in the 16 to 18 years age group are much higher than in younger age groups.  The number of presentations to accident and emergency services with self-harm is high, with the highest number in the 15 to 19 years age group.  The number of referrals to children's services of young persons with self-harm and suicidal ideas has increased significantly.  The recent CAMHS annual report showed that those presenting with self-harm and suicidal ideas accounted for approximately 70% of referrals among children. <\/p> <p>  The rate of suicide in children in Ireland is also very worrying.  Suicide rates for boys are the fourth highest in Europe and the highest in Europe for girls.  We should, therefore, prioritise mental health services for people in this age group. <\/p> <p>  We will cite the example of psychology posts in our service to highlight the staffing difficulties we face.  Based on United Kingdom figures, our service should have 63 psychologists.  Based on the more conservative figures in A Vision for Change, we should have 26 psychologists, whereas we have only 8.6 psychologists.  We only refer children for admission to adult units as a last resort and do so very rarely.<\/p> <p>  We will highlight some of the reasons for the lack of inpatient beds for children and ways in which we could avoid some child inpatient admissions.  On the first issue, it is proving difficult to recruit and retain child psychiatrists to work here.  Without a consultant, some of the inpatient units have been forced to reduce their numbers by half because other people have had to step in to try to fill the empty posts.  The reason is that working conditions in Ireland have been compared unfavourably with those in other English speaking countries.  As a result, we are unable to retain senior staff and trainees are moving abroad.  In addition, many consultant colleagues in Dublin have left permanent posts in recent years.  Others are on long-term sick leave or have chosen to emigrate.  If staffing for CAMHS could be improved, we would be better able to retain some of these senior staff.  <\/p> <p>  It is also difficult to recruit and retain nursing staff to work in child and adolescent mental health services, including the inpatient CAMHS units, especially in Dublin.  This is leading to beds being closed, which increases the number of children inappropriately ending up in adult mental health units.  Some emergency staff are moving to other parts of the country where housing is less expensive.  We should adopt the approach taken in other countries and consider ways of attracting staff to live in the capital.<\/p> <p>  From the point of view of trying to reduce admissions of children aged under 18 years, access to acute day hospitals would allow psychiatrically unwell children to receive more intensive intervention in the community as opposed to being admitted to hospital.  While these services require large numbers of staff because they are highly labour intensive, they are a much cheaper option that admitting children to inpatient units.  If CAMHS funding was ring-fenced, these services could be developed. <\/p> <p>  The multidisciplinary staff who work in our teams are dedicated and hard-working.  Our service has experienced a significant increase in referrals recently, details of which I submitted to the committee.  The number of referrals in the past ten years increased by between 50% and 365% per annum, with no increase in the number of staff on our teams.  On the contrary, the number of staff has reduced in some areas.  It is very difficult to work in such conditions and we are unable to deliver the service we would like to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maria Migone"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Migone and invite the spokespersons for the Children's Rights Alliance to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#CC00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":795,"content":"<p>The Children's Rights Alliance welcomes the opportunity to address the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  The alliance is a national movement uniting more than 100 organisations to make Ireland one the best places in the world to be a child.  We change the lives of all children by making sure their rights are respected and protected in our laws, policies and services.<\/p> <p>  The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance is deeply concerned about the provision of mental health services to children and young people in Ireland.  As the previous speaker noted, according to the recent UNICEF report, Ireland has the fourth highest teen suicide rate among high income countries.  Recent studies suggest that young people in Ireland may have a higher rate of mental health issues than their peers in other countries.  However, this has not resulted in a correlated level of service provision.<\/p> <p>  All children have a right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health under Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has emphasised the serious nature of mental health problems for children and the need to tackle \"behavioural and social issues that undermine children&rsquo;s mental health, psychosocial wellbeing and emotional development.\"  In our alliance report card 2017 grading the Government on its progress in 2016, mental health received a grade of D minus, reflecting the lack of progress on realising children's rights in the area of mental health.  Children's rights should be respected and central to the provision of mental health care.<\/p> <p>  The Children's Rights Alliance welcomes the introduction of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 which proposes, if passed into law, to introduce a prohibition on the admission of children to adult psychiatric units save in exceptional circumstances where it would be in the best interests of the child to do so.  In this regard, the legislation should provide for a comprehensive definition of the term \"best interests\" and an oversight mechanism to ensure children's rights are respected.  A comprehensive definition of the best interests of the child and the factors to be taken into account are already outlined in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  This definition should be considered and adapted for legislation to amend the Mental Health Act.  One of the important factors in this regard will be hearing the voice of the child.  We will all agree that it was essential to hear from Ms Gallagher today. <\/p> <p>  As recognised by the Seanad committee, there is a need not only to prevent the admission of children to adult inpatient units but also to address the underlying issues in the child and adolescent mental health services which result in these admissions taking place.  Ms Ahern will outline the Children's Rights Alliance's views on the waiting lists for CAMHS, the persistent admittance of children to adult inpatient units, the need to develop an out-of-hours service to respond to the needs of children and young people and the introduction of an advocacy service for children and young people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#CC00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Saoirse Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":796,"content":"<p>I will first address the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services, which are underdeveloped and for which demand continues to exceed availability.  Between January and March of this year, a total of 2,818 children were waiting for a first appointment with CAMHS, of whom almost 300 had been waiting more than a year.<\/p><p>In 2016, the UN committee examined Ireland and expressed concern about access for children and young people to mental health treatment and about the long waiting lists for support.  It recommended that the State act to improve the capacity and quality of mental health services.  The Children's Rights Alliance acknowledges there are significant staff shortages in CAMHS, which we heard about earlier and which contribute to the long waiting lists for children.  Of the recommended 127 specialist teams, the most recent figures we could find show 67 CAMHS teams are in operation.  Not all of these operate to full capacity and there are significant geographic variances in provision.  For example, there are no services for those aged 17 in north Tipperary because the HSE has not been able to fill a clinician's post there.  Achieving the full staff complement of CAMHS is vital to ensure children and young people are not put at risk by waiting too long for support.  Reducing these waiting lists requires ongoing investment in the development of child and adolescent community mental health teams.<\/p><p> The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child clearly states that where placement in a psychiatric unit is necessary children should be separated from adults where appropriate.  It emphasises that any decisions on their care should be made in accordance with their best interests.  In 2016, the committee expressed concern at the ongoing practice of admitting children and young people to adult wards due to the lack of suitable age appropriate facilities.  It recommended the State take action to address the issue by improving the capacity and quality of services for inpatient treatment.  The Mental Health Act 2001 is outdated and not in line with Ireland's international human rights obligations, particularly those relating to children.  The Act does not require children and young people to be admitted to age-appropriate facilities.  As a result, we all know children and young people are placed in adult facilities.  In 2016, some 17.8% of all admissions of children under the age of 18 were to adult units.  The mental health commission's code of practice states the placement of children in adult wards should be phased out by the end of 2011, but it is very clear this non-legally binding code has not been effective.  There is an overall shortage of inpatient beds, and existing beds are not always used to full capacity.  As we have heard, A Vision for Change recommended 108 beds should be operational throughout the country.  However, at the start of the year, only 66 beds were in operation and since then we have seen a 50% reduction in state-of-the-art facilities such as Linn Dara in Cherry Orchard.  These have been due to staffing issues.  The 2013 report by the Inspector of Mental Health Services showed children are placed in adult facilities even when adolescent bets are available.  Investment and support is needed to ensure all adolescent inpatient beds are available and used and units are fully staffed.  Investment in primary care services and the establishment of emergency out of hours community support are also necessary.<\/p><p> I will briefly address the issue of advocacy services for children and young people.  An independent advocacy and information service exists for adults in mental health difficulties, but there is no equivalent national independent service for those aged under 18, particularly those using inpatient services.  This means children cannot access their right to information, their right to be heard and their right to participate fully as service users in mental health services.  The UN committee has recommended establishing a mental health advocacy service for children that is accessible and child friendly.  We echo this recommendation and call for the establishment of a national independent advocacy service for all children under the age of 18 engaged in mental health services.  I thank the committee for its attention, and I am happy to take questions afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#CC00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Ahern","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":798,"content":"<p>I thank the committee.  I watched some of the parents who gave evidence this morning and who spoke about their experiences.  If that is not compelling, I do not know what is.  What would be really good is if we heard from more young people, such as Ms Gallagher.  This is about children and young people and hearing their voices in the process would be beneficial.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC is the national child protection charity.  We hear from children every day and we will base our evidence today on this.  We have 1,000 contacts from children every day through our Childline service.  Last year, we received more than 15,000 calls and 3,000 online contacts on mental health issues.  These were on everything from self-harm to bullying to sexuality to identity.  They are huge issues for children and young people.  Very often we are a first port of call because we are a 24 hour listening service that is directly accessible to children and young people and available nationwide.  Everything we will say will be based on what they tell us on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>  A big issue, which echoes what many people have already said, is excessive waiting lists.  Young people and their parents seek support, but when they reach out this support is sometimes not available for 12 to 18 months.  They and their parents call us and they are frustrated.  They are at the end of their tether.  They are trying to find something while they are waiting for the mental health service.  This brings up something Mr. Jackson will speak about, which is the importance of prevention and early intervention.  Not every child needs CAMHS.  Many other services can be used to support children and young people, and if we get in there early it will stop some children from having to go to CAMHS, which will free up time and reduce waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  Children may have a dual diagnosis with mental health difficulties and addiction issues.  One young person was told to come back at the age of 18 because there was no service for 17 year olds.  Her father resorted to detoxing her himself in the house because no service was available and he was at the end of his tether.  This was the only option available to him at that point.  This is something we need to look at.  The services should be needs-led and they should meet the needs of children and young people, wherever they are.<\/p> <p>  Ms Ahern spoke about the out of hours issue.  A total of 75% of calls received by the ISPCC Childline service come through out of hours.  People need support out of hours.  Dr. Jeffrey Shannon's recent report on section 12 echoed this and found 75% of cases were out of hours.  Not all of them were mental health cases by any means, but some of them certainly were.  It indicates a need for services outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  We know childhood and children's issues happen 24 hours a day seven days a week.<\/p> <p>  Hearing the voice of the child is important and people have spoken about this.  The children we have spoken to have told us they do not feel listened to.  They are frustrated their cases are discussed with their parents but the information is not shared with them.  Children who are 16 or 17 years old can access medical care in their own right, but it is ambiguous as to whether the mental health aspect can be looked at in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is placing children in adult psychiatric units.  Everybody here has said it, so I do not need to go into it again.  Children should not have to head outside of the jurisdiction to get the support they need.  We have seen a lot of this in recent years.  The support should be here.  There is a huge amount of expertise.  Having to ship off to another country a child who is already vulnerable will exacerbate the situation.<\/p> <p>  What has come across to us through our support line and our face to face service is parents and carers do not know what to do.  They are not supported.  They are not sure how to support their young person, what the plan is and who to go to for help.  We have a postcode lottery with regard to whether a CAMHS team happens to be in operation and is fully functioning.  If this is the case, there have been very positive and good results, but if it is not, because there is not a full team, a child does not necessarily receive the service.  If a child receives another service or is not bad enough for CAMHS, parents have expressed frustration that they must go down the private route because support is not available because they do not meet the criteria.<\/p> <p>  We need to address the waiting lists and consider the importance of prevention and early intervention.  We must broaden the referral pathways so more than a GP can make a referral.  We must ensure 24 hour support for children experiencing mental health difficulties.  Their views must be heard and parents and caregivers need to be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Nicholson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I will speak briefly about our experience as a service and about prevention and early intervention.  The testimony today and what we heard earlier illustrates the level of frustration felt by parents and young people when it comes to accessing services.  I could go through anecdotal cases, but there is no need to echo what was said earlier because it was illustrated perfectly.<\/p><p>It shows the level of crisis management happening with our services.  This relates back to the adage that prevention is always better than cure, which is something that is very true for mental health services and for services in general which relate to children who might have behavioural or emotional difficulties. <\/p><p> There are a huge amount of service available at the moment, including our own child and family support service, the area-based childhood programme, SPECS.  The list is quite long.  Often there is a referral issue.  People often do not know who to go to, how to be referred or what supports to actually seek.  This plays into the frustration levels that parents and young people feel.  An informational route needs to be introduced so that everyone knows from a very early stage how to access the correct levels of supports when necessary.  The level of public health nursing needs to be massively increased so that once any person becomes a parent for the first time they are well armed with the knowledge of how to access supports if an issue arises.  We need to try to get away from the level of crisis management that seems to be dogging the entire system currently.  We have heard the statistics from Lucena and from CAMHS.  We see the statistics ourselves when we look at our own Childline figures.  Tusla does not see itself as a crisis management agency.  It sees itself as a preventive agency, although it does deal with crisis management.  Within its own founding legislation Tusla states that it is an agency that provides preventive family support services.  It is very clearly defined and yet it is dogged with crisis management.  That becomes problematic.  Tusla's budget is sizeable.  The figures thrown about are quite large, but less than 1% of its budget focuses on preventive works.  That needs to increase.  We need to focus on preventive steps.  As my colleague, Ms. Nicholson, said, there are many cases which do not need to get to CAMHS.  If the correct work is put in at the correct stage we can prevent that so that it does not become overburdened with work that need not have arisen.  <\/p><p> When we look at prevention as opposed to crisis management, we also look at the very nature of economies of scale and what investment can really improve.  Research completed by the National Economic and Social Forum stated that if Ireland was to invest appropriately, for every &euro;1 it invests in a preventive piece of work its savings would be between &euro;4 and &euro;7 in the outcomes.  The cost base analysis is reduced, and that is a massive saving.  For every &euro;1 spent we would save between &euro;4 and &euro;7 if we avoid the crisis management work.  We need to focus on that preventive piece of work again.  If we do not we might end up on the same path as other agencies in other jurisdictions.  The American system is particularly bad at focusing on preventive steps.  It is very crisis-oriented.  For its cost base analysis, it costs the US tax payer $18, compared to just $1 of investment if it focused on preventive measures. <\/p><p> Focus needs to be brought back to this prevention and early intervention model.  There are many great services out there, including our own, and if we can reduce crisis management - although some crisis management will always happen - crisis management agencies can work successfully and remove the necessary bogged-down status that we seem to be in at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Jackson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting Mental Health Reform to appear here this afternoon.  I particularly thank Senator Joan Freeman, rapporteur of the committee, for shining a spotlight on this significant matter and facilitating this space for child and youth mental health to be discussed within the Seanad.  I also thank our colleague organisations who have appeared before the committee, and to reflect on the consistency that is being provided.  Many of the organisations here are members of Mental Health Reform and members of the Children's Mental Health Coalition, which we have provided the secretariat for a number of years.  There is a lesson in the consistency of what is being said about what could help.  It is not a matter of figuring out what we need to do.  It is much more a matter of implementing what we know needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  Mental Health Reform is the national coalition of mental health in Ireland, promoting improvement to health services and implementation of our national mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  We have 59 member organisations, many of which operate in the area of child and adolescent mental health, including Jigsaw, Spun Out, ISPCC, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Irish Association of Infant Mental Health and the Union of Students of Ireland.  We have shared and provided the secretariat of the Children's Mental Health Coalition.  The primary object of that coalition has been to advocate for improvements in child and adolescent mental health services.  This has been underpinned by evidence-based research and guidance produced by the coalition, including its most recent report on meeting the mental health support needs of children and young people in Ireland.  We would be happy to provide copies of same to the members of the committee. <\/p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to discuss the experiences of children and young people and their families in accessing mental health services in this country.  We understand that this consultation is taking place during a period when the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 is moving through the legislative process.  This legislation is designed to end the practice of admitting children to adult psychiatric units except for in exceptional circumstances.  We recognise the positive intention of the Bill.  Mental Health Reform and the Children's Mental Health Coalition have long called for an end to inappropriate admissions of children to adult wards, in keeping with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Admission of a child to an adult ward can make the in-patient experience much more distressing for the child, as we in Mental Health Reform have heard when young people speak to us about that experience.  It does not always provide a safe environment and it does not provide a place that supports the child's recovery.  We see ending inappropriate admissions of children to adult wards as an urgent priority and an urgent policy objective.  Fundamentally, what is required in order to make that right realised is the immediate implementation of the resources necessary to provide the community-based and age-appropriate acute care that would reduce child and adolescent admissions to acute adult wards.  We have consistently called on the Government to develop early intervention and community-based mental health services and supports for children and young people, and I will address what a community based mental health service would look like. <\/p> <p>  We have heard about the need for early intervention.  In the area of perinatal and infant mental health there is widespread consensus that the perinatal and early years period provides a unique opportunity for the prevention of mental health difficulties, in addition to the fact that early intervention for mental health challenges can happen with mothers and infants at that time.  However, perinatal mental health supports remain significantly underdeveloped, and early years infant mental health has received little recognition and little priority in the Irish context.  Early intervention needs to include a response which places the emotional health and well-being of mothers, infants and families on a par with that of their physical health.  The absence of specific policy and supporting service provision to address such needs is a gap of huge significance that must be addressed as a matter of priority.  I would agree with the previous speaker that all the evidence is that when those kind of supports are provided in infancy, huge value of money is achieved, as well as much better outcomes over the lifetime of the child. <\/p> <p>   In terms of mental health in primary care, Mental Health Reform has recently welcomed the sanctioning of the recruitment of 114 assistant psychologist for primary care teams across Ireland.  We hope that those assistant psychologists will be recruited as a matter of urgency.  The addition of these posts is a positive step towards providing earlier access to mental health support for children and adolescents.  However, they will not be sufficient on their own, and it is imperative that such efforts by Government continue to increase capacity in mental health in primary care.  Mental Health Reform and the Children's Mental Health Coalition have consistently advocated for enhanced capacity within the primary care sector to provide comprehensive mental health services.  To date there have been significant shortfalls in this area.  We specifically advocate for increasing the availability of mental health expertise through dedicated mental health workers across all primary care teams, who would enable early intervention, and significantly, we believe, reduce the number of referrals required to child and adolescent mental health services.<\/p><p>We would like to highlight the need for access to specialist mental health services, and our colleagues in Inclusion Ireland have identified one group of young people and children who need specialist mental health services.  It is ironic that the services for the children who are most vulnerable because of having dual or co-occurring conditions, such as mental health and intellectual disability, children and young people with dual diagnosis of mental health and addiction or children with other disabilities, for example, from the deaf communities, have received the least development since publication of A Vision for Change.  There are ongoing difficulties in accessing child and adolescent mental health services for these children despite a decrease in the CAMHS waiting list.  We heard earlier today that, as of December 2016, approximately 2,419 children and adolescents were waiting to be seen by CAMHS, of whom almost half were waiting more than three months for a first appointment and almost 10% of whom were waiting more than 12 months.  Between the end of 2015 and 2016, the number of children waiting more than a year had increased by almost 20%.<\/p><p> The difficulties for children and their families in accessing appropriate mental health care - the lack of community-based mental services - is reflected in the high numbers of child admissions to adult inpatient units.  As of December 2016, almost 20% of children were still being admitted to acute adult services and the Ombudsman for Children has reported that a number of complaints submitted to his office were about children, particularly children at risk of suicide or self-harm, being inappropriately placed in adult inpatient facilities and that these situations appear to be due to a lack of suitable emergency placements.<\/p><p> We have previously identified the lack of 24-7 crisis services for children and young people as being particularly problematic and this is reiterated by UNICEF's report card on child well-being, which shows that Ireland has the fourth highest teen suicide rate in the OECD region.  In addition, as figures were highlighted earlier, the rates of self-harm show that such practices are highest among young women aged 15 to 19 and among young men aged 20 to 24.  Some experts in the area of child and adolescent mental health have pointed out that it is at the very point at which children and adolescents are most at risk that the least amount of provision is available and it is ironic that the point at which we could have the most impact on young people's lives and have the best outcomes for the future is where the least provision is available.  We believe that 24-7 crisis mental health services should be made available to children and young people in every community in Ireland as a matter of priority.<\/p><p> We have also identified the challenge of providing high-quality accessible mental health services as a result of the difficulties with inter-agency collaboration.  The Children's Mental Health Coalition conducted a small survey of two areas in Ireland and found that a bewildering number of agencies were involved in supporting the mental health of children.  Therefore, we advocate for a national level approach to inter-agency collaboration to ensure there is a smooth process through all the myriad of agencies for the child and the family to be able to get the services they need.<\/p><p> Other shortfalls we would like to highlight include the lack of a common assessment framework for children in the care and youth justice systems.  Such a common assessment framework would ensure that the mental health needs of children in the care and youth justice system were considered holistically as part of the wider supports that are provided for them.<\/p><p> We would also reiterate here the need for an advocacy service for children and families who are engaged with mental health services or who are trying to get mental health services.  In the absence of an advocacy service that is tailored to children who are using mental health services and their family members, there is growing concern that this group of children and young people are not being heard in terms of their experience of the services, their will and preferences with regard to how mental health services are provided.<\/p><p> We agree that the lack of staffing in CAMHS must be contributing to many of the shortfalls in service delivery.  As of the end of December 2015, there was just 51.6% of the staffing level recommended in A Vision for Change across child and adolescent mental health services and despite concerted efforts by the HSE to improve staffing levels in CAMHS in the past couple of years, there has been very little increase in the staffing available.  In essence, child and adolescent mental health services are in crisis across the country in terms of being able to get adequate skilled staff.  For example, there is no consultant psychiatrist in post in Cork at present, which is putting extreme pressure on existing services, in particular, in providing crisis support into the emergency departments in Cork.<\/p><p> Additional measures must be put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure that child and adolescent mental health services are adequately staffed and to look at creative ways of using existing staff to enable prompt access to CAMHS.  The increasing demand on an already overstretched child and adolescent mental health system undoubtedly will continue in the context of an increasing demand from children and their parents for better supports.<\/p><p> Despite recent positive developments, there are still huge challenges to bringing about the type of mental health care for children and young people that fulfils both national policy and international human rights obligations.  These challenges reflect the continued vulnerability of children and adolescent mental health services across the country and the need to have sustained political will to improve the mental health outcomes of Ireland's children and young people.<\/p><p> We are happy to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":803,"content":"<p>We will move on to Mr. Peter Hughes of the Psychiatric Nurses Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#FF00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":804,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Freeman and the committee for the invitation to appear before it.<\/p> <p>  The Psychiatric Nurses Association represents the vast majority of nurses working in the mental health services.  Unfortunately, the number of nurses working in the CAMHS is diminishing.  It is difficult to recruit, particularly in the CAMH services.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight our concerns regarding the child and adolescent mental health services.  The inadequacies and underinvestment in the current provision of CAMH services is something to which my union has consistently drawn attention and today's consultation should help in addressing the many gaps in CAMH services that exist nationwide.<\/p> <p>  In 2006 the Government policy on mental health, A Vision for Change, was published outlining a ten-year plan for the provision of mental health services.  Chapter 10 of that widely welcomed strategy outlined the recommendations for child and adolescent mental health services.  Some of the key recommendations included the provision of two multidisciplinary teams per 100,000 of population, one liaison multidisciplinary team per 300,000 of population and one day hospital per 300,000 of population.  It went on to state that urgent attention should be given to the completion of the planned four 20-bed units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin and that multidisciplinary teams should be provided for these teams.  This would have resulted in 100 beds nationally.<\/p> <p>  Most importantly, the strategy in A Vision for Change included a provision for an evaluation after five years to assess the progress in the delivery of child and adolescent mental health services and whether it is meeting the needs of the population.  That did not happen and 11 years on, one must question the commitment to the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, published research last year on the implementation of A Vision for Change in the adult mental health services ten years on.  The results were stark.  Among the findings were that 60% of beds were closed yet only 30% of the recommended community services were put in place, and there were no 24-hour crisis intervention services as recommended.<\/p> <p>  We are currently conducting a second phase of research in partnership with the RCSI on the specialist elements of A Vision for Change, inclusive of CAMHS.  Early indications suggest that 37% of the recommended multidisciplinary teams are operational as outlined in A Vision for Change, most of which do not have a full team, while 53% of the liaison services are in operation.<\/p><p>There are now 48 operational beds out of the 100 beds which were recommended.  This research will be concluded towards the end of the year.<\/p><p> The population of children nationally is expected to increase by 8,500 between 2016 and 2017, which is consistent with the percentage increase annually over the past decade.  This projection, coupled with the expansion of the free GP scheme, will create an additional demand on child and adolescent services.  I refer also the appalling situation of young homeless children who currently live in hotels, guest houses and short-term accommodation.  Not only does this increase the level of mental distress for those involved but transient situations also complicate the follow-up for these children as they are transferred from one CAMHS service to another.<\/p><p> According to the mental health division operational plan 2017, there are 74 multidisciplinary teams.  A Vision for Change recommended two teams per 100,000, which would equate to approximately 94 teams.  This is a shortfall of at least 20.  In the greater Dublin area alone, only 50% of the recommended multidisciplinary teams are operational.  Again, these are not full teams.  There are four day hospitals nationally.  A Vision for Change recommended one for every 300,000.  This equates to 15 day hospitals, meaning we have a shortfall of 11.  There should be 100 beds nationally but there are only 48 operating currently due to staff shortages, particularly that relating to nurses.  There are 20 beds in Cork but the unit only has the capacity for a maximum admission of 11 children.  As the speaker before me mentioned, this is down to shortages of consultant and nursing staff.  St. Joseph's unit in Fairview has 12 beds, of which only six are operational due to both nursing and medical staff shortages.  The promised Limerick unit never materialised.  The 20-bed unit in Galway appears to be fully operational.  In the past month, the new purpose-built 22-bed unit in Linn Dara, which only opened 18 months ago, has closed 11, or 50%, of its beds due to nursing shortages.  The unit has only 50% of the nursing resources required and the 11 beds were closed despite the fact that 20 children were awaiting admission.  The consultant psychiatrist in the Wexford service is on leave and there is, therefore, no consultant cover in that area.<\/p><p> We know all too well that the net result of these bed closures and the under-provision in child and adolescent services is to further increase the unacceptable admission of children to adult mental health units.  We witnessed a stark example of this just last month with the admission of a 16 year old to the adult mental health unit in Waterford.  Adding to the trauma already experienced, this child had to spend the night sitting on a chair.  As recently as last night, a 17 year old was admitted to a chair in Kilkenny adult mental health unit.  Just over a week ago, another 17 year old in Kilkenny was admitted and remains on the unit.  Both Waterford and Kilkenny are operating above capacity with the result that children are being admitted to chairs.  To say 11 years after the publication of A Vision for Change that this is unacceptable is an understatement.  CAMHS are in crisis and, as outlined, the provision of services is deteriorating rather than improving.  There were 74 operational beds two years ago but 26 fewer beds are operational now.<\/p><p> Children and parents are being let down by the non-implementation of the policy and the lack of commitment or urgency in addressing the crisis yet we have known for 11 years what needs to be done to address the crisis.  As a matter of urgency, the 100 beds recommended must be provided and staffed in order to provide quality therapeutic care and prevent further admissions of children to adult units.  The number of community mental health teams must be increased as recommended and they need to be fully staffed and expanded to provide out-of-hours, home-based services.  The criteria for clinical nurse specialists is too stringent and must be adapted in the short-term to facilitate an increase in applicants.  There are approximately 20 unfilled clinical nurse specialist posts nationally, mostly due to insufficient applicants as the criteria is too strict.  The recommended 15 day hospitals must be provided.  The full implementation of these measures will only take place through a substantial increase in the budget for mental health services, which currently stands at 6.4% of the health budget.<\/p><p> Bizarrely and probably only in Ireland, we have witnessed a situation where, despite the growth in the demand for mental health services across the board, there has been a steady reduction in the mental health budget as a percentage of the overall health budget.  According to A Vision for Change, the budget was 13% of the health budget in 1984, 10% of the health budget in 1994 and 7.1% of the health budget in 2004.  The commitment to mental health services has diminished in each decade but the demand has never been greater.  It is little wonder that the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, admitted in the D&aacute;il on 23 May last that mental health services have been neglected for over 30 years and were, as he put it, the Cinderella of many HSE Votes and Department of Health Votes.  Looking at the mental health budget, it is sadly hard to avoid concluding that A Vision for Change was used as a cost saving measure on the backs of those with mental health issues.<\/p><p> Too often, we have seen the closure of beds with a paltry investment in community services.  We struggle to provide vital services while trying to manage a severe shortage of psychiatric nurses, largely because our highly-skilled and committed nurses are being forced to leave the Irish health system for better pay, terms and conditions in the private sector, the UK, Australia and Canada, to name but a few of the market contenders.  Who can blame them when there is a consistent failure to address pay and conditions in a realistic manner?  That is the only realistic solution to stop the haemorrhage of our nurses to other countries and encourage those who are abroad to return.  Something similar can be said about the medical profession also.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to outline briefly the extent of the ongoing crisis in child and adolescent mental health services which we know is impacting severely on parents and children.  I assure the committee that the PNA is determined to see the issues in child and adolescent services addressed before they deteriorate even further.  We would welcome the committee's support in achieving the provision of a properly-resourced and staffed CAMHS which meets the needs of children, families and communities nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hughes and welcome Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#GG00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":807,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its very kind invitation and I acknowledge publicly the outstanding work of Senator Freeman.  It is important that an issue like mental health has a champion.  I am here to express my personal support for the work she is doing, not only in convening this session but also in respect of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill, which is very worthwhile.  I had the opportunity overnight to examine it forensically and I have a few suggestions which I might share with the Senator privately rather than to detain the committee.  It will make a very real difference.<\/p> <p>  I have often said that the measure of any democracy is the manner in which the needs of the most vulnerable are considered and met.  There is no more vulnerable group than children with mental health needs.  I have consistently raised, as Mr. Hughes referred to it, the Cinderella response to mental health issues.  I have just finished what has been acknowledged as the largest worldwide audit of the exercise by a police force of its emergency child protection powers.  I have looked at over 500,000 fields of PULSE data.  One of the key messages emanating from my review of thousands of cases is that, linked to the substance and alcohol abuse one finds in many of them, mental health issues underpin much of the abuse.<\/p><p>Across many of those cases there is substance and alcohol abuse.  Linked with that there are mental health issues underpinning much abuse.  What we have, as we heard from many witnesses this afternoon, is a lack of cohesion between services.  The key finding from my report is that agencies operating under the umbrella of protecting vulnerable citizens need to work together seamlessly to protect children.  We have poor inter-agency communication and co-operation across all agencies.  My report shines a light on this.  It is a unique window onto what happens when parents fail children and also when the State fails children.  The State fails children when its agencies fail to co-operate to provide a service.  My colleagues from the ISPCC referred to the need for a 24-hour service for families.  Families operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  They do not operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Our services appear to focus on 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. provision, and that must change.<\/p><p> I also acknowledge the outstanding work undertaken by front-line workers such as nurses, hospital doctors and consultants.  Those professionals do their best at the coalface but we must ensure they have the proper infrastructure.  The system fails many children experiencing mental health difficulties.  The failure to recognise mental health issues at an early stage can have a profound impact on the family.  After thousands of hours of work I found that warning signs are sometimes ignored, referrals are not timely and appropriate and the consequences can be devastating and cost the State much more in the long term.  I listened to Peter Hughes and it struck me that we have had much vision but very little change.  We need implementation.  Senator Freeman will have heard me repeat on a number of occasions yesterday that we can have the best implementation plans in the world but unless they deliver for service providers, they are meaningless.  We have had hollow promises which have not delivered for vulnerable citizens.<\/p><p> I also share the views expressed by the Children's Rights Alliance.  I am delighted to be the founding patron of the alliance.  The report card is a useful exercise in benchmarking where we are performing on key child protection issues.  When a child is taken into the care of the State and is placed in a service, the State is saying it can do a better job.  When the State fails those children it is failing them a second time.  That can have devastating consequences.  We are saying the care they receive in a family setting is not good enough but we fail to provide a better service.  We have raised expectations only for those expectations to be dashed in the context of poor communication between agencies and the failure to deliver on services.<\/p><p> The representative of the ISPCC referred to preventative services.  I passionately share that view.  Working upstream prevents problems downstream.  If we seek to tackle these issues at a much earlier stage, it will relieve the pressures on mental health services at a later stage.  Over a long number of years, and having reviewed thousands of cases, I have found that we are very good at crisis intervention but preventative services rank very much second best towards when we must deal with the crisis.  We pump all of the finance into the crisis because it becomes a political issue.  However, dealing with the matter in the first instance would have a much better outcome for both families and children.<\/p><p> I also believe that the system is unable to cope with children with emotional or behavioural problems or mental health problems.  Again, the Children's Rights Alliance and the ISPCC referred to the fact that we end up exporting our problems to other jurisdictions, at a significant cost to the State.  We must now develop home grown solutions to problems for our children.  That must be done as a matter of urgency.  Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires the State to protect children from harm and ill-treatment.  It is a mandatory obligation to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and attention.<\/p><p> In terms of international best practice in this area, I believe we must take a rights-based approach.  We must consider the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its attention to four general principles.  The first is non-discrimination under Article 2 of the convention.  We are not treating children equally.  We have heard a powerful story from another organisation, BeLonG To, that does outstanding work for children in minority groups who do not get the type of service they need.<\/p><p> The next principle is in Article 3 of the convention, the best interests of the child.  I support the suggestion put forward by the Children's Rights Alliance in terms of defining \"best interests\" in the context of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill.  We must be able to benchmark what \"best interests\" means.  We should set down a number of principles that would assist the court in determining, if there is a failure on the part of the State, what best interests means for children with mental health issues.  I will be happy to share with Senator Freeman some suggestions as to how that might be realised.  In 2012, the people of Ireland voted that children would have a special status in our Constitution.  That must mean something.  The people of Ireland said that the best interests of the child should be at the core of our decision-making.  For that reason, I believe this is very good draft legislation.  It attempts to prohibit the placement of children in adult psychiatric facilities, save in exceptional circumstances where it is in the best interests of the child.  There is pragmatism in the proposal.  It will put pressure on the State to ensure that more is done in this area.  I believe this legislation will deliver and I urge Senators to engage with it in an enthusiastic manner.  The legislation ups the ante in ensuring that we outlaw this practice.  There are parallels.  Ten years ago, everybody said we could not outlaw the detention of children in St. Patrick's Institution but it has been outlawed.  It is not beyond the State to erase poor practices and practices that grievously breach its human rights standards.<\/p><p> The other standard is the right of every child to life, survival and development.  Every child should have a fair chance in life, including those children who end up in psychiatric units because we do not have the correct facilities.  I am no expert in mental health but why can we not have adolescent and child psychiatric facilities alongside each other?  I am conscious of the difficulties that this Bill might create.  I had an opportunity overnight to discuss it with a number of medical practitioners.  Some concerns were articulated around the fact that there could be a possibility of a child ending up in a hospital where the expertise is not available.  However, we must come up with solutions, and this Bill is hugely important in providing the impetus for dealing with this issue.<\/p><p> Most important is the voice of the child.  We heard powerful evidence this afternoon from BeLonG To on what it means for children.  Those statistics are shocking, as is the fact that children in an LGBT setting could be so vulnerable.  The State must react to this.  I have always argued that the poor practices of the present become the tribunals of the future.  For that reason, it is incumbent on the State to act in a speedy fashion.  There was also a reference this afternoon to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There is no need to wait for the ratification of the convention.  The Children's Rights Alliance referred to Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that every child has the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  By any standard, placing a child in an adult psychiatric facility does not equate with the highest attainable standard of health.<\/p><p>Very useful guidance is provided on Article 24 in general comment No. 15.  If members are in any doubt as to what that provision means, they should look at general comment No. 15.  I  would argue that the State, by allowing children to be placed in adult psychiatric facilities at present, is grievously breaching international law.  If we are concerned about our reputation internationally, we will move very quickly to address this huge injustice for children.  Another provision that is arguably breached is Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhumane or degrading treatment.  I defy anybody to say that placing a child in an adult psychiatric unit is not inhumane or degrading treatment.  The European Convention on Human Rights, which is binding on all State bodies, albeit it has been introduced at a sub-constitutional level, provides, under Article 8, that the best place for a child is within his or her family.  If we are taking the child out of the family into what I would describe as a sub-optimum environment, in other words an adult psychiatric unit, I argue that we are in breach of Article 8 and also Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is also arguably in breach of the Constitution under the new Article 42A.  There are two such provisions of the Constitution, namely, the new children's right provision and the personal rights provision in Article 40.  <\/p><p> I am conscious of the time constraints.  Pages 72 to 75 of my report document poignantly mental health issues arising for those children who require an emergency out-of-hours service.  It is quite striking that many of those children access the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, line.  I wish to publicly acknowledge how important the ISPCC's Childline is for children.  In the sample that I ended up examining, I was surprised to that so many of the children had accessed the Childline service.  The service does an outstanding job protecting very vulnerable children.<\/p><p> Children aged between 16 and 18 are in what I would characterise as the twilight zone.  Those are the children who most suffer because they are neither getting a child service nor an adult service.  We need to make sure that their rights are fully vindicated.<\/p><p> I would argue that childhood is for a limited period of time.  If we do not provide the right service at the right time to a child, it will have very significant consequences.  I remind those in this Chamber that childhood, once it is interrupted, cannot be restored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":810,"content":"<p>We have about an hour for questions.

In our deliberations we will take on board the groups that have highlighted particular risks.  Compared with the wider population, people who are LGBT suffer two times the level of self-harm, three times the level of attempted suicide and four times the level of severe or extremely severe stress, anxiety and depression.  Young people with intellectual disabilities experience a higher incidence of mental health difficulties and yet they are the ones who cannot access the system because they do not fit in either.  It is extraordinary.  Mr. Peter Hughes rightly reminded us that approximately 2,500 children will be living in emergency accommodation tonight.  What will their mental health be like tonight, what will it be in the future and will we have the tribunals that Dr. Shannon talked about?<\/p> <p>  The voice the child is critical.  It was great to have Ms Arianna Gallagher in here earlier.  The idea of an independent advocacy service is one that I fully support.  It was brought up by both the ISPCC and the Children's Rights Alliance.  We are getting the same messages this afternoon as we got from the mothers during the earlier session this morning.  Our children are falling through the cracks, of that there is no doubt, between Tusla, the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and in terms of disability where one can be either too young or too old if one is 17 or 18 years of age and, as we heard from Ms. Julie Helen's case studies, one's diagnosis can be either too mild or too severe or one can have autism or a dual diagnosis.  I would be interested to hear from Dr. Shannon what a good system looks like, where has he seen it in place and to where can we look for it?<\/p> <p>  I would ask Dr. Maria Migone if every child and adolescent mental health service is led by a psychiatrist and is that necessary?

We deal with these matters in terms of questions concerning mental health facilities at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which is ongoing.  In the context of mental health reform, the priority is approved centres.  Therefore, we have a dearth of child and adolescent mental health services because we have to go with the approved centres in the first instance because that is stipulated in legislation.  It was mentioned that legislation should be enacted to ensure that CAMHS funding is ring-fenced in its own right and cannot be touched or go back into the adult services.  I would our guests to expand on that.<\/p> <p>  Reform of the Mental Health Act, which Senator Freeman is trying to progress, should provide for a stand-alone child section.  That is worthy of inclusion and perhaps we are beginning the consideration of that here.  <\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Peter Hughes, my colleague from the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  He mentioned that almost 3,000 children in Dublin alone tonight with be without a bed.  They could represent the Magdalen laundries of the past and the tribunals of the future.  We need to cognisant of that and to act well.  <\/p> <p>  We need to realise that we do not have a single mother and baby bed for postpartum women, which is significant.  We have nothing in place to embrace a mother and baby at the start of the baby's life.  The public health nurse has a important role to play for mothers who need help at home.  In addition to only ticking the boxes for eye co-ordination, hearing, balance and so on, there also needs to be a box for mental well-being and emotional well-being.<\/p><p>We need to train our public health nurses in that.  I know there are psychiatric and intellectual disability nurses in our union but it would be interesting to approach them to see if we can change that in the school of nursing.<\/p><p> In respect of the Lucena Clinic I am a strong advocate of, and believer in, group therapy where it is possible and necessary.  I know the service gets individual referrals but has Mr. Hughes thought perhaps of the milder form of distress among teenage girls and boys and that there is perhaps an opportunity for some sort of regular group therapy at school, with a professional, to explore what is happening in the mind of a teenager?  We all went through it but growing up can be distressing.  It might be helpful to steady the group, give them a sense of themselves and a sense of empowerment so that no matter what they do, the outcomes will be good.  It will help them reach adulthood, to mature and maintain loving relationships and contentment with life.  Given that there is such a big demand on psychiatric nurses could the schools provide some sort of group therapy that is more cost-effective but also more emotionally effective?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#JJ01200","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Shannon to answer all our questions first because he has to leave at 4 p.m.  I have two questions: what are the short-term quick wins we can put into the report that would be cost-effective?

I have visited several centres and reviewed several models of inter-agency cooperation.  I emphasise throughout the audit report that notification is not communication.  There is a tendency among State agencies to feel that if they fill in a form and push it on the problem is solved.  There is also a lack of respect for the discrete professions.  One sometimes thinks it has greater insight than another.  A stand out example was a centre I visited in the Bronx, established to review child abuse where there was someone from the New York Police Department, NYPD, social services, a forensic paediatrician.  All of the professionals were working together trying to map a solution for the individual child.  What happens too often is that the focus is not on the child, it is on generic services.  The ISPCC made the point that the solution is all too often a package.  We need to build solutions around children rather than around available services.  There needs to be a fundamental review of how agencies cooperate with each other.  That is the international trend.  There is also an interesting approach in Manchester and London, the multi-agency model where agencies work together on site to find solutions.  We need fundamental reform.

Although we made an effort to say it was urgent and needs to be addressed and we hoped to engage further on it, there has been no urgency in addressing the issue.<\/p> <p>  The 11 beds in the Linn Dara services closed because they did not have enough nurses.  They had only 50% of what they should have had.  Most of the staff in Linn Dara are relatively newly qualified and they are going abroad.  Even within Ireland private services give them incentives and will pay a certain amount up front if the nurse will stay two years.  They go to the UK and Australia, where their education is supported, they get time off to do it, it is paid for and they have subsidised accommodation.  The NRS is building 20,000 units for staff accommodation because it knows this is a problem.  The high rents in Dublin were mentioned.  That needs to be addressed, whether through subsidised accommodation or a rent allowance.  Nobody is listening but we are losing the nurses year on year.  A graduate scheme was brought in to pay 85% of the staff nurse salary for the first two years to those people who qualified and then 90%.  The majority of them emigrated and it would be very difficult to get them back.  That was one of the biggest insults to any profession, not to pay the salary after people had done a four year honours degree.  Those people have left with a seriously bad taste in their mouths.  We need to keep the people we have here and to keep those who will be trained in the next few years.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Devine mentioned that there is no mother and baby bed in the country.  When I started training as a psychiatric nurse and for several years after that, there were several mother and baby beds.  Twenty-five years on, we seem to be stepping backwards instead of forwards.  Two years ago there were 74 operational beds.  We are now down to 48.  One always imagines that services will gradually improve rather than deteriorate.

We heard about the preventative piece and more and more is being pushed into CAMHS either because people are waiting or because of a lack of other services - for instance, autism services in this country are very poor.  These are group of young people who are very vulnerable to mental health difficulties.  We often end up seeing them in very crisis-bound states and they are very difficult to treat because of their difficulties.  Without the care underneath that there are more coming through to us.  There are many young people using our services who have autism and that is similarly the case with intellectual disability.

The Children's Mental Health Coalition has produced a report on child and adolescent mental health supports spanning from primary care to tertiary would look like.  We can provide that to the committee.  If we had to chose one thing that would make a big difference it would be building up the primary care mental health services.  Many of the difficulties that arise for child and adolescent mental health services are because we had utterly neglected the primary care mental health services.  One of the problems with A Vision for Change is that it never specified what primary care mental health should look like, nor did the 2001 primary care strategy.  In that vacuum, it has been completely overlooked - over what is almost 20 years since the primary care strategy was published.  We think that would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  On things that might offer quick wins, improvements to the co-ordination of services to children and adolescents and young people who also have an addiction problem would be helpful.  We often hear a view in mental health services that someone needs to deal with his or her addiction before they can access mental health treatment.  That is not realistic in children's behaviours.  It would be helpful if we could adopt an approach of no wrong door, where mental health and addiction services could work together and no child would be turned away or told that it was not appropriate for him or her to get help just because he or she has an addiction.<\/p> <p>  Senator Devine asked about the ring-fencing of funding.  That might have come from the ISPCC; I do not think it was from us.  Ironically, at the moment funding is not the biggest problem.  There are funds but it has not been possible to spend them.  The HSE's mental health division's operational plan shows that at the end of December, there was the equivalent of almost 1,500 vacant posts between development posts that had not been filled and posts that were being covered by agency staff and overtime.  It would be a first step if we could fill the posts to which there is already a commitment.  Of course, we would advocate that in the context of next year's budget the development funding required to keep the reforms on track should be allocated.<\/p> <p>  Senator Devine also asked about the Mental Health Act.  We have advocated that there should be a separate section in the Act for children, to reflect the best interests of the child.  There should be specific principles in a section of the Mental Health Act that are appropriate to children which would be distinct from the principles that are appropriate for those who fall under the Mental Health Act who are adults.  We have clearly said that 16 and 17 year olds not being able to consent to treatment is not in keeping with their human rights and should be rectified urgently.  Something needs to be done about the process for involuntary admission of children, where decisions are made that children have to be admitted to hospital, to make sure the voice of that child is heard in proceedings.<\/p><p>We are not sure that the court process is facilitating that at the moment.  That is our response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#LL01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Shari McDaid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDaid.

From my perspective and perhaps from that of BeLonG To as well, positive coping strategies should be instilled among young people from a very early age.  This does not really happen across the board for young people and it could really benefit young people, for example in education - I think that is a natural place where some of that work can happen.  That is really important from our perspective because of what we have been seeing within our service.  Pieta House came in and is providing a service with us at the moment.  When it first opened up, we thought that the service would be oversubscribed from a very early point, but unfortunately, young people from the LGBTI community have such a low expectation for their mental health that they thought that it is normal to self-harm and okay to think about suicide.  It was not until our youth workers and other staff members started talking to young people and saying that that was why the service was there for them that people started coming into the service much more frequently, to the point now that the staff member from Pieta House in our service is kept very busy.<\/p> <p>  The issues of minorities relate to that.  It is not just LGBT young people that need to discover more positive coping strategies, such as help-seeking or solution-focused strategies around mental health.  It is also related to - as Inclusion Ireland has said - those with disabilities, young Travellers, asylum seekers and refugees.  There is a much larger range of individuals than just those I have mentioned.  There really needs to be a focus on those minorities that are more likely to experience higher levels of morbidity around mental health, because of the stark statistics that are there, as have been indicated by myself and others here today as well.  There should be a focus there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I will follow on from much of what Mr. Duffy has said.  Inclusion Ireland has stressed and Senator Colette Kelleher has reflected back to us the importance of highlighting people with intellectual disability in this regard.  I mentioned a figure of 25%.  That is a HSE figure.  We know that at least one in two people with an intellectual disability has no contact with health services at all.  They are in the community.  They include members of the Traveller community.  We know that Travellers are five times more likely to have either an intellectual or a learning disability.  We know that 40% of young people under the age of 16 on custodial remand have a learning disability.  We know that about 40% of people who were homeless have a disability.  These people are not necessarily in contact with health services.  They are in the community.  We need to think a little bit - and I do not know whether it is beyond the bounds of the report - about why.  We have people who are resource deficient and socially isolated who have intellectual disability and are experiencing mental health difficulties.  There are other things that we can do that are beyond the treatment we can give.  Early intervention is absolutely an option, but what can we put in place structurally to prevent people from becoming socially isolated?  There is much research, including the likes of the longitudinal study on aging.  The intellectual disability supplement to that said that people with intellectual disability are twice as likely to be socially isolated as anybody else is.  That level of isolation and resource deficiency has a huge role to play in people's mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#MM00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Do Ms Julie Ahern or Ms Saoirse Brady from the Children's Rights Alliance wish to answer a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#MM00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>It is very hard to say what one thing would make a difference.

Maybe the child does not need to go to CAMHS, but rather to a different service.  It is important that a child can be directed to the help he or she needs at an early stage.<\/p> <p>  At the end of last year, the Children's Rights Alliance produced a \"Know Your Rights\" booklet with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and we ran a training session with more than 100 different service providers on mental health itself.

There were also front-line staff from St. Patrick's Mental Health Services, which helped to fund that training programme.  We travelled to Galway, Cork and Dublin.

It would sometimes prevent the need for other things, along with early intervention.  Sometimes, there is a view that 24-hour services cost much money.  It is not about that for us.  If one looks at the North, it has an out-of-hours 24-hour social work service, and part of that social work service has a huge amount of mental health professionals within it.

At the top of my wishlist would be the Mental Health Act having a separate section on children.  There would not only be a separate section on children, but some level of cohesion between all of the different pieces of legislation, so when a child comes before the District Court, that child may very well have mental health issues, and we lack a bridge between these discrete areas.  We seem to think there is just the mental health issue, that will be dealt with separately.  What I found quite striking about the audit report is that many children were made subject to the Mental Health Act in the context of a child care issue arising.  We need a broader vision as to how to deal with both the child care dimension and also mental health issues that parents may very well have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#MM00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498726800,"counter":848,"content":"<p>One of the biggest things that will change things for young people is inter-agency working because so much else will flow from that.  We heard this morning from others, very strongly, about how their children were falling through the cracks.  They were falling between the stools at different stages along the way, and much of the time, unnecessary extra mental health difficulties followed on from that.  We heard from Ms Lauren Keogh, who told us about her daughter, Zara, who unnecessarily experienced anorexia because she was waiting for mental health services.<\/p><p>We heard from Lauren Keogh.  She told us about her daughter, Zara, who experienced anorexia unnecessarily because she was waiting for mental health services.  Similarly, many of the case studies I detailed in my opening remarks relate to self-harm and talking about suicide.  However, those issues started far earlier in the life of that child or young person.  If we had more inter-agency working and joined-up thinking, as we discussed this morning, our children and young people would be far better able to become self-advocates and peer advocates.  Everyone would be working together and our children and young people would know that they are important, that the system is in place for them and that they can speak up for themselves and for each other.  The ultimate goal in advocacy is to speak up for ourselves and for each other.  It is true that we are all sitting here as advocates for other people, but the ultimate aim is that people can speak up for themselves.  Many things will aid that and flow from that.  Accessible information will help people to be self-advocates and to look after their mental health.  That is what we should all be aiming for as citizens in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#MM00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Helen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Are there any final words on the members' side?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/PCJ2017062900002#NN00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses.
