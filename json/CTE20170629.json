Despite all the efforts by the Department and even the financial constraints put on the purchase of cigarettes more than 200 million packets were still sold in the country.  However, I refer to the fact that some 21 million packets are in illegal distribution.  Furthermore, we see the prevalence now of the illegal distribution of roll-up tobacco pouches.  It is a very serious problem.  The 6% reduction in the illegal sale of packets of cigarettes in the past seven years is welcome, but 21 million packets are in distribution.  That is a loss to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;170 million, which is significant, not only from the Revenue's point of view but also from the point of view of the Department of Health in terms of its pursuance to reduce smoking in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#B01400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>We will note that.

It was agreed to postpone this correspondence for consideration today.  This correspondence states:<\/p><blockquote>Many options to address the flooding in Cork have been considered by the Design Team and assessed by reference to a comprehensive suite of technical, social, environmental and economic criteria.  Arising from this detailed multi criteria analysis, a preferred option was identified and brought to exhibition.  The estimated cost of the proposed scheme is &euro;140 million based on 2017 construction costs including VAT.<br \/><br \/>As part of the statutory Exhibition process carried out between 12 December 2016 and 7 April 2017, over 1,000 submissions were received on the proposals.  The submissions are currently being considered before the scheme is advanced to formal Confirmation (i.e. Ministerial approval) stage. OPW is in discussions with Cork City Council on the main issues arising to identify potential changes to the Scheme as a result.  OPW is aware of alternative design ideas being put forward and all such proposals will be considered during this process.<\/blockquote><p>I propose that we ask the OPW to keep us informed of and up to date on each stage of this project as it progresses.  Deputy Catherine Murphy had requested this report, so I hope it is of some assistance to the people who raised the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#B01500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>There is big resistance to the particular solution proposed and the 1,000 submissions give some indication of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#C00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 624C, correspondence received from an individual on 19 June 2017.  This correspondence is addressed to the chief superintendent at the Bridewell Garda station and alleges treason by judges and contempt of the High Court by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.   It has been copied to us and we have not been asked to do anything.  We acknowledge that we have received it.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 625C, correspondence dated 20 June from an individual making an observation about the meeting on 20 June with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I propose we forward a copy of this to Dr. Richard Thorn, who is carrying out the review, subject to the correspondent's approval.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 627C, correspondence dated 22 June 2017 from the chairman of a company in the Czech Republic.  This correspondence alleges that NAMA failed in its duty to achieve the best achievable financial return for the State by dealing expeditiously with the Savarin loan portfolio owned by Welwyn in order to expedite the matter.  We received this complaint and wrote to NAMA, which has given us a detailed response, about it.  We sent it back to the company involved which is writing again to us.  We do not normally do this.  However, in order to be practical and expedite the matter on behalf of the correspondents, I propose that we refer this to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which is scheduled to meet representatives from NAMA on 13 July.  Those representatives are not scheduled to come before our committee for some time.  They will be before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in two weeks' time so we will ask the latter to follow up on this issue with them.  That is a practical way of moving matters on.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 629C and 635C are two items of correspondence from an individual - dated 23 June and 27 June, respectively - regarding the Courts Service spectrum growth fund.  Inquiries were previously made with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its response was forwarded to the individual, who was also advised that the matter will be discussed at the meeting on 13 July 2017 when the representatives from the Courts Service are due to attend.  We will be raising this issue publically and formally with the Courts Service on that date.  The individual has requested a meeting with the Chair and members of the committee in advance of the meeting on 13 July.  If such a meeting were to happen, it would, be definition, be informal in nature.  As we will be engaging with the Courts Service on 13 July, I propose that we raise the matter then.  I do not know if we will have an opportunity to meet the individual in the interim.  Perhaps members can do so in order that we might be fully up to date with the views of the people who are corresponding with us and thereby have a proper discussion on the matter at the public meeting with the Courts Service on 13 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>It would be quite useful to meet informally with this individual because there is quite a bit of information involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017062900002#C00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1498726800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I know that this person has been in contact with Deputy Catherine Murphy and several other members of the committee.

I am relieved we will not take Report Stage in advance of the recess because, in some ways, it is a little unusual that the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was undertaken by the health committee and not this committee.  We therefore find ourselves having to have a detailed discussion about a very important Bill on Committee Stage, so I ask for a little forbearance in dealing with some of these issues because they are important and we will, sadly, have to spend some time teasing them out on this Stage.<\/p><p>This group of amendments relates to the periodic payment order.  We raised on Second Stage the fact that if we do not link the periodic payment orders, PPOs, to the actual cost of health care, we run the very real risk of people who have been catastrophically injured by our health service not receiving the funds they need for their care through their final days.  The original recommendation regarding indexation of PPOs, which was unanimously endorsed by the judicial working group on medical negligence, was that an earnings and cost-related index would be introduced to act as a guide for the periodic payment orders.  Sadly, the Bill before us does not do this.  It gives us a harmonised index of consumer prices, as published by the Central Statistics Office, with no special provision for an index of care costs.  Therefore, what we see in the Bill is the exact opposite of what was unanimously recommended by the judicial working group, which is unfortunate.<\/p><p> The working group also pointed out that the Department of Finance, in its paper on periodic payment orders indexation, noted that an index based purely on either the CPI or the harmonised index of consumer prices would not directly take account of wages, and that this was critical in dealing with situations where people's after care was going to be factored on.  The paper noted that over the longer term, the index should give the best outcome for recipients.  That is what we are arguing for here.  With our amendment, we are trying to find a middle ground between the various recommendations.  The CSO's quarterly earnings survey would not take into account changes in the cost of medical devices or assistive technologies, medical treatment and so on and would not be enough to properly index PPOs in our opinion.  We are proposing that within a year of enactment of this section, the Minister would publish or cause to be published an index that tracks the following: earnings in the nursing and care sectors and such other sectors as appear to the Minister to be relevant to the indexation of PPOs; the cost of medical treatment in this jurisdiction; the cost of mechanical or other health aids and appliances in this jurisdiction; and such other costs as appear that Minister might think would be relevant.  That index shall be used along with the HICP to calculate the rate of PPOs.  The extra year has been provided for to allow things to bed in and give some idea of the types of fluctuation, if any, that might occur in the costs that are being measured. <\/p><p> I appreciate that the Bill does provide for a review of the use of the HICP after five years, and for the drawing up of a more relevant index at that time if the Minister so wishes.  The Bill as it currently stands, however, is too wide open in that regard.  There is no obligation for such a review to take place or for a change to take place following a review.  It is too big a risk.  Five years is way too long.  After the five years, the review could take a year or two years.  How long would it then take for the new index to be bedded in?  What would happen to the people who are subject to these orders in the meantime?  It is not an exaggeration to say we could be talking about eight years before a new index would be created.  That is not acceptable for the people whose categories we are dealing with.  In its current form, the Bill provides no guarantee that any new or better index would be created.  There is no obligation to provide it and the Minister might not even bother to do so.  It is too risky.  Our amendments will bring certainty to the situation.  Given the recommendations of the bodies that surveyed this already, that is particularly important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#A00800","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Wallace wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#B00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>We have worked together on these amendments.

I recognise that the amendments proposed by Deputies Daly and Wallace are intended to put in place a dedicated index for adjustment of periodic payments orders, as recommended by the High Court working group on medical negligence and periodic payments.  The intention is to enable periodic payments to be index-linked to the levels of earnings of nurses and care personnel and to changes in costs of medical treatment and assistive aids and appliances, as Deputy Daly has outlined.  That being said, I am not in a position accept the proposed amendments.  I will outline the reasons and we can discuss the matters further as we go along.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 5 and the consequential amendments arising from it seeks to place an obligation on the Minister to put in place a new index, based on changes in earnings of health care personnel and the cost of medical treatment and devices and to provide that this index should be used in conjunction with the HICP to determine the annual adjustments to periodic payments orders.  The first difficulty is that the development and establishment of statistics of the type suggested by the Deputies are outside the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The proposed index would, in all probability, take longer than 12 months to implement.<\/p> <p>  Second, the proposed amendments give no guidance as to the manner in which the new index would be applied to PPOs.  It is not clear whether the new index is intended to replace the HICP.  If the intention is that both indices will be used, it is not clear what weighting would be given to each index.<\/p> <p>  Third, an actuarial study of PPOs commissioned by the State Claims Agency concluded that, in respect of indexation of PPOs, an index in the form suggested by the working group on medical negligence and periodic payments could prove to be volatile given the small sample size available in Ireland.   The study suggested that, instead, a broader based index should be used to reduce volatility and provide certainty with regard to payments under a PPO to catastrophically injured persons.  The issue of indexation of PPOs and the actuarial study to which I have just referred were considered in detail by an interdepartmental working group on legislation on periodic payments orders, which was established to examine the technical aspects of introducing PPOs.  The working group concluded that an index based on the Irish harmonised index of consumer prices should be the initial index specified in the Bill.  <\/p> <p>  Fourth, a very important matter to note in respect of indexation of PPOs is that it is not always the case that a dedicated index would provide a higher annual adjustment than the HICP.  I note, for example, that in the UK the dedicated index used was the annual survey of hours and earnings, ASHE 6115.  While the UK retail price index was historically lower than the ASHE value, since 2008 the UK RPI has outperformed ASHE 6115 by a cumulative 13%.<\/p> <p>  I believe it is vital, in putting this legislation in place, that persons who are catastrophically injured should have certainty with respect to the manner in which annual adjustments to the PPO will be made.  Given the lack of detail provided in the amendments with regard to the practical operation of the proposed index, accepting these amendments would provide less rather than more certainty regarding the operation of PPOs.  For those important reasons, I cannot accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#B00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I do not accept what the Minister of State says.  What we are talking about is exactly what the judicial working group recommended.  It pointed out that the harmonised index of consumer prices as published by the CSO does not make any special provision for an index of care costs, which is the essential component in dividing any such periodic payments.  The most costly elements, which must be tracked most closely, are the wages and care costs.  I cite the Department of Finance's paper, which dealt with this issue and considered the potential of the quarterly earnings, hours and employment costs survey published by the CSO.  This measures hourly and weekly earnings of all employees in enterprises of over 50 employees and a sample of employees in smaller enterprises.  The paper by the Department of Finance stated that over the longer term, this index would give the best outcome for recipients.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept what the Minister of State is saying to the effect that what we have put forward is some airy-fairy, unsubstantiated thing that could not be calculated.

I remind the Minister of State that what we are trying to do here is deal with the care needs of people who have been catastrophically injured by our health service providers, by providing for the option of moving away from lump sum payments to payments made on a more sustained and better basis.

We are deferring to the superior input of the judicial working group and our Department of Finance mandarins.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is saying that it is beyond the capacity of the Minister for Justice and Equality to come up with a revised indexation scheme.

We need to get it on the Statute Book and working.  If these amendments were accepted, we would have to consider them further, which would delay the legislation more.  I am discussing the principle of the matter.  For instance, there are technical issues, in that two indices are mentioned in amendment No. 5 and one would be used \"along with\" the other, but it does not say how that would be done.  We would have to figure out the details of doing that because the amendment is vague.  If there are two indices, does one take precedence over the other?

What is being sought in this amendment is exactly what the judicial group asked for, namely, a balancing and factoring in of earnings and costs related to medical care.  The exact way in which to do that would be a reserved function for the Minister.  It is not beyond the Government's capabilities to do that.  These elements must be factored in.  Generally speaking, the cost of medical care and treatment has increased more than the consumer price index, CPI.  The Minister of State said that it could increase less than the CPI, but the experience over the past while has been to the contrary.  We need to factor in an index of care costs.  That is what I am asking the Government to do.  How it does that is its prerogative.  The legislation would call upon the Government to strive to take account of these costs.  Actuarial assistance would be provided to it in making that a reality.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept that \"five years\" is no time, as has been suggested.

The Bill states on page 11: \"The Minister shall, not less than 5 years after the commencement of this Part, carry out a review of the application of the index referred to ... in order to determine the suitability of that index\".  It is not \"after\" but \"not less than\".  I would not like to think there would be any long-fingering of this.  A review will be carried out.  At that stage we will have the historical information.  That is about right, not too long or too short, bearing in mind that it will take a while to create and implement the index the Deputy describes.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact the Deputy is anxious for this to be moved on, as we all are.  I am disappointed that it cannot be scheduled for next week.  That is out of our hands completely.  We are all on the same page.  We want this to happen as soon as possible and we want the best for patients.  We think the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, is the way to go.  Deputy Daly wants a separate index.  We are not clear as to how the two indices would interact.  There is talk of regulation and the Minister shall make a regulation, but the Minister of the day may decide to give weight to the HICP.  The amendment does not suggest one should take precedence over the other.  The amendments are unclear.  I suggest that in order to move this important legislation on, we park this for the moment and in a few years, when there is a review and we see how it is working, if it needs to be revisited I am sure whoever is here at that time will revisit and fix it.  There is a lot of goodwill around this to make it work.  I am not prepared to accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#D00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I remind the Minister of State that \"not less than 5 years\" means more than five years, which was my point.

It would not be out of its hands exclusively but alone.  It is important to say that in the original heads of the Bill it was held in this section that a patient safety incident was one in which a patient was harmed or there were reasonable grounds for believing that during the provision of a health service for a patient, he or she was placed at risk of injury or harm, or an incident in which but for timely intervention the patient would have been harmed.  The definition of &quot;patient safety incident&quot; is really important as it is patient safety incidents that will be the subject of the open disclosure parts of the Bill.  The original version of the heads of Bill has been changed such that the only incident that will qualify as a patient safety incident is one where the health service provider has reasonable grounds for believing the patient was at risk or that but for a timely intervention, he or she would have been put at risk.  That gives way too much power to the health service provider.  We know from global literature and, sadly, our own experience of the HSE that developing a culture of openness and transparency is difficult.  We know that it has been challenging for the HSE.  In that sense, allowing the decision to be solely in the hands of the health service provider goes against the grain of what we are trying to do with this legislation.<\/p><p>I accept fully that in many cases the health service provider is best placed to know whether somebody was put at risk.  That goes without saying, but our amendment would not change that and the health service provider might still be the party making that input.  There may be a small number of cases where the patient or a family member sees something happen and there will be reasonable grounds for suspecting the patient or a loved one was put at risk or something happened.  They should also have the right to have an incident included, if one likes.  That is all we are trying to do.  For example, a doctor or a nurse may fill an intravenous antibiotic bag with penicillin when the patient is allergic to it and the patient may stop it happening before the line goes in.  The health service provider may not see it as a patient safety incident, but it could have been and the patient should have the right to have it examined.  That is all we are saying.  It would happen in a small minority of cases where a patient or a family member might think the patient was put at risk or there was some evidence to that effect.<\/p><p>The amendment would mean power would not be solely in the hands of the service provider.  It would help health service providers to change the culture where there is a battening down of the hatches and everything is denied.  It would help to open disclosure without imposing an onerous burden.  The provision was included in the original heads of Bill and it is what we are trying to achieve with this group of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#E01400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Open disclosure builds trust and confidence, which must be very valuable commodities in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#E01500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>This is a very interesting discussion and I thank the Deputies for the amendments.  The definition included in the legislation follows the accepted World Health Organization's international classification of patient safety.  That definition takes into account actual adverse events where harm is caused to the patient.  We all agree on that point.  It also takes into account incidents in which harm could have been caused, or no-harm events, outcomes that did not reach the patient but which would have caused harm if they had, or \"near misses\".  It must be pointed out that in aligning our definition with that of the World Health Organization we allow the Irish health system to make international comparisons and participate in international surveillance and research on patient safety.<\/p><p>The legislation is intended to capture not only incidents where harm was caused to the patient, but also no-harm incidents and near misses.  Taking out the reference to \"in the opinion of the health service provider\" could leave things unclear.

Where harm has occurred, anyone can identify that and make it known.

Our amendments do not change that.  We are providing that these incidents will be covered by the open disclosure policy.  None of that changes if these amendments are accepted.  It is necessary to have reasonable grounds.  Obviously if something happens and harm has occurred, that is easily identified by anyone who is there.  One does not have to be a doctor to know that.  If harm had not occurred or it was a near miss, there must be reasonable grounds for that.  The only impact of our amendments is who decides the reasonable grounds or to whom that authority is given.<\/p> <p>  Following changes that came between the heads of the Bill and the Bill as published, the health service provider is the only one who can do that.  I fully accept that in probably 95% of the cases the health service provider will be the one.  However, taking out the sole use will affect the 5% of cases.  Sadly, it sometimes happens that the health service provider or the person who is at the coalface might tense up, try to deny liability and not record it.  In such cases the family or the individual might have the option of having it looked at under the open disclosure provision.  It does not take anything from the health service provider.  I think it is quite important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace is right in saying this will help hospitals and health service providers move away from the cultural problems they have about accepting errors.  It will encourage them to acknowledge errors in order that a system is put in place to ensure it does not happen again.  I am strongly attached to this group of amendments.

The legislation is unusual in seeking to place an obligation on a hospital - let us call it a hospital - following a patient safety incident to tell the patient about it without any consequences for litigation or liability on the part of the hospital.  It is unusual in that respect.  That is why the definition of \"patient safety incident\" is important.  The obligation is on the hospital to disclose it.<\/p> <p>  At present the paragraph states \"in respect of which the health services provider [the hospital] has reasonable grounds to believe placed the patient at risk of unintended or unanticipated injury\".  Deputy Daly proposes to change that to cover cases in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe the patient was placed at risk.  The question relates to whose belief we are talking about.  The verb \"believe\" is used.  It currently includes the phrase \"reasonable grounds to believe\".  I would have thought that since the hospital must make the disclosure, it would be unusual if there was an obligation on the hospital to disclose something and it did not believe or did not know what happened.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly gave the example of a member of the family knowing something.  If they saw something, they would bring it to the attention of the hospital.  If the hospital then becomes aware of it and believes it and if it does nothing about it, the family can sue it.  There could be a case where the hospital is not aware of grounds and yet the obligation is imposed on the hospital to disclose this.  The important thing is to whom the belief refers.  Given that it states \"reasonable grounds to believe\", it has to be an individual.

We are talking about unintended and unanticipated injury where patients are placed at risk.  We are not talking about an injury that actually happened, but a step beyond that where someone was placed at risk.  In the vast majority of cases the hospital would know that.

I know it is late and we have had a mad week but it is important.  These sections are about apologies and they also are linked in with the mandatory point of view.  It is clear from the definition of a patient safety incident in the Bill that we are talking about something that went wrong.  In some cases, something went wrong and the patient was hurt and in others, something went wrong and the patient was almost hurt.  The starting point is that something went wrong.  Despite that, the Bill provides that an apology for the wrong at an open disclosure meeting is entirely optional for the health service provider.  I find that mad.  The fact that an open disclosure meeting is happening at all is a clear acknowledgment that something went wrong.  It would not be happening if something had not gone wrong.  In that context, I do not understand why an apology would be optional.  If one bumps into someone in the street, or if one spills a person's pint, one says sorry.  If something goes wrong, to say sorry is natural.  We are trying to develop the natural human, cultural reaction.  Given that the Bill provides very strong protections for apologies, where just because someone says sorry that does not mean they will be sued as a result later on - that is very much in the Bill - why then would we make the apology optional?  The Bill states firmly that an apology is not an admission of liability and that it cannot be entered as evidence of liability in court.  Even were this group of amendments to be accepted, it would not change that.  An apology could not be admitted in court and it is not an admission of liability.  The amendments do not change that.  The apology is protected and I do not have a problem with that but we drafted our amendments to section 10 because apologies are incredibly important for patients and their families.  We know this from the people we have met.  An open disclosure should be about getting access to the full information but it also for them to say &quot;sorry, we did not mean for this to happen&quot;.  Quite often that could save the State a lot of money because people sometimes decide to take a legal action because they are fecked off because the health service providers would not admit they were wrong or they did not even say sorry.  Not apologising leaves us open to more hurt and angry patients and in that sense it goes against the grain of the Bill. <\/p><p>I know the Minister of State will tell me the health service provider will, of course, apologise and if that is the case, that is great.  Perhaps the Minister of State is not going to say that and will agree with me, which would be even better.  If he is going to say that such providers will do it anyway, my amendments do not alter that.  If such an apology is not made mandatory, it will not affect those providers that would do it anyway and consequently, it does not matter to them.  It is the providers that might hide behind the fact that they are not so obliged with which we are dealing.  Its absence undermines the confidence of the health service providers in the strong protections that are there.  The Bill is very strong.  Saying sorry does not mean that a provider will be sued in court or that they have admitted liability but it is a human, important thing.  It is good for the service and is good for patients and we should make it mandatory, in that the act of a provider having a meeting about an open disclosure is a statement that the provider is sorry that something happened.  It might be the case that it is saying that something happened and the consequences are very insignificant.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  That is completely in keeping with the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#G01500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Does any other member wish to speak on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#G01600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>In British law, are there provisions regarding patient safety incidents and voluntary disclosure akin to what we are introducing here?

Our goal is to create a safe space where there can and should be full disclosure of the facts surrounding a patient safety incident and the implications, if any, for the patient's care and treatment.  Let us put that out there, it is about a safe place.  The Ombudsman is clear that many people who have complained to his office say that what they are looking for is for the service provider to acknowledge that something went wrong and to receive a meaningful - I stress meaningful - apology.  People say that they want to be listened to and assured that lessons have been learned and that the same mistake will not happen again or that every effort will be made to ensure that.  While apologies can be mandatory, I believe that voluntary apologies are far better.  I have a number of reasons for thinking that.  Is it a real apology if it is forced?<\/p><p>An apology must be a considered expression of regret.  It has to come from the heart.  It involves building trust, human relationships and human interaction in situations where this is the appropriate thing to do, which depends on the individual circumstances.  The Ombudsman outlined that it is important that, when making an apology, the person making an apology understands the other's circumstances and what his or her wishes are in regard to what occurred.  That is a good principle.  One cannot put together a meaningful apology without understanding what a patient has experienced and how this impacted on his or her individual concerns and requirements.  Empathy is a large part of this.  The giving of an apology, as Deputy Clare Daly has rightly said, is a human experience for all involved, both doctor or service provider and the patient.  It should be borne in mind that it can take time to gather all the information and facts relating to a patient safety incident.  It is only once this has been done that a meaningful apology can be given.  Otherwise the apology will simply be a box-ticking exercise, which not what members want.<\/p><p> The recent HSE evaluation of open disclosure stressed the importance of making apologies with integrity and compassion, and of having the right people informed and prepared to make an apology in advance of an open disclosure meeting.  This Bill will, for the first time in legislation, define an apology in relation to an open disclosure of a patient safety incident as an expression of sympathy or regret.  Research indicates that not all patients want an apology but when they do, such an apology needs to be personalised, sincere and honest.  This approach is further underpinned by the HSE&rsquo;s policy on open disclosure and the Medical Council&rsquo;s new guide to professional conduct and ethics for doctors and other professional codes.<\/p><p> I am mindful of members' concerns on balancing the need to provide for a full understanding of the circumstances of a patient safety incident with the need for meaningful engagement of staff with patients.  It reminds me of two children, one of whom has done something to the other, and a parent comes along and tells the guilty child to apologise, which he or she does, but does not mean.  He or she had to apologise because it was mandatory.  It did not come from the heart.  In the next breath, the child tells his or her sibling that revenge is on the way.  There needs to be a voluntary, sincere expression of remorse.  If it is made mandatory, all of that is taken out from it and it loses what we are trying to build, which is a culture of respect, openness, empathy and feeling.  If a person feels he or she is being forced to give an apology because of legislation, it is missing the whole point.  I hope members will accept the reasons I have sincerely outlined as to why I have chosen not to accept their amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#G01800","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's portrayal of \"The Simpsons\" was excellent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#H00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>On the question on what happens in the United Kingdom, there is a duty of candour for services there.

In defamation cases, one of the remedies a person generally seeks and gets is an apology but there is nothing in the Defamation Act to say that a publisher is mandated and required to apologise; it is something one does if one wants to.  Members are trying to present this legislation as though its result will be harmonious and that doctors and medics will put their hands up.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that that will happen.  Insurance will have an impact on that.  Insurance companies will insist that doctors disclose in their policy renewals whether they have had any patient safety incidents, made any open disclosures or apologised under this legislation.<\/p> <p>  The reason I asked about the UK is that although there is a duty of candour, there is nothing as specific as this legislation.  There is a provision at section 10(1)(c)(ii) of the Bill stating that if one makes a disclosure or apology it will not \"invalidate or otherwise affect\" a contract of insurance.  I am concerned that many insurance providers will now stipulate that contracts of insurance will be governed by UK law rather than Irish law, which will mean that individuals will have to disclose whether they have been party to a patient safety incident or to an apology.<\/p> <p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Clare Daly regarding an apology, the amendment under consideration is amendment No. 17, which proposes to delete &ldquo;where&rdquo; an apology is made and substitute &ldquo;when&rdquo; an apology is made in section 10(1) and I am sure that subsequent ones seek to mandate it.  An apology has legal consequences.  Irrespective of what is set down in this legislation, an apology can have future legal consequences.  On balance, an apology should be voluntary and genuine.

I am conscious that as this legislation is developed, members cannot be ignorant of its background and the problems there have been in Ireland with health service providers.  The example given by the Minister of State of a parent reprimanding a child is a good one because a parent tells a child to apologise to his or her brother or whatever - and perhaps the first time an apology is begrudgingly given - to train the child that in polite adult society, people need to learn manners, empathy and decent human behaviour when interacting with others.  It has caused huge grief and hurt to citizens and probably cost the State a significant amount of money because some people have not received an apology they felt they were owed.  It will be difficult to foster the culture we want to have if one is coming from very low base and a culture of denial because people are afraid they will end up in trouble if they give an apology, which is not true and has no legal status whatsoever.  One would never have to train an adult as one would a child because an adult has learned the behaviour.  However, we have an infantile health system which has operated poorly and needs to be retrained.  In that sense, one has to tell it to apologise to its brother because our experience has been that this has not been done.  We have all met people who have been devastated by their experiences who just needed a kindly word.  I understand that members are trying to get to a situation where that would be voluntarily provided but I believe the legislation should say that is mandatory.  To revert to my earlier point, this legislation should reinforce the confidence of health service providers that they have nothing to fear from acknowledging what happened and putting their hands up.   The committee can move to a vote on this if needed but that is the thinking behind this provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#H00700","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Deputy Daly has made my case for me here because she has more or less indicated that a sincere, voluntary apology is much better than a forced one.

That is why I have a problem with this set of amendments.  All many people want is a sincere apology.  If a patient felt that a doctor or other person was only apologising to him or her because he or she had to, the patient might conclude that the apology was meaningless and decide to sue.   If people feel the apology is sincere and real, they may decide not to take things any further, conclude that a genuine mistake was made and go no further with the matter.<\/p><p>This is a philosophical argument in some ways but an important one.

It is only by training and re-educating someone that one gets a system of a sincere apology.<\/p> <p>  To put this in context, I am referring to an open disclosure meeting where it has been acknowledged that something has gone wrong.

This subject is a complex issue and in some ways philosophical.<\/p><p>Deputy Wallace and I tabled these amendments because we felt that section 10 required a lot of amendment.  Section 10 holds that neither the information provided nor an apology made during open disclosure will be admissible as evidence in court in regard to any action that arises from the patient safety incident that has been disclosed.  It also holds that the information provided, and an apology when it is made, will not be admissible as evidence in a professional malpractice or misconduct investigation, etc.<\/p><p>As I pointed out on Second Stage, that factual information at an open disclosure meeting could potentially be denied later by a health service provider in court is mental.  Such a situation is completely contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The Medical Injuries Alliance has pointed out that the scenario is abhorrent to the administration of justice.  I refer to a court being precluded from considering information necessary to establish the relevant facts before making a decision on a question of liability.  This is a huge issue and, therefore, this group of amendments is one of the key important groupings.<\/p><p>The proposal to prevent a patient from being able to rely on information provided during the open disclosure process will have the opposite effect and breed more distrust.  Let us say a patient is provided with clear and frank information on what caused an adverse incident but later the very same facts or version of events are denied by the service provider.  What will that scenario do for a patient's trust?  His or her trust will be shattered.  That is why my colleague and I made a distinction between an apology and information.  To deny factual information under open disclosure being used later on is completely wrong.  People gave evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health during pre-legislative scrutiny on this matter.  We are saying when litigation does occur, it should happen speedily.  If people are denied access to information they know exists or are prevented from using it, we will get into big costly proceedings.  The victims will have to pay their legal representatives to unearth the information through other processes.  The amendments call for the court to have the ability to evaluate all relevant factual evidence on foot of the incident in question.  This includes facts developed in open disclosure and any records for the purposes of making the disclosure.  That does not mean that the case will be lost or that the person's court proceedings will succeed.  The court must still evaluate the claim.  To deny information that exists as part of these proceedings would be completely wrong and that is why we tabled our group of amendments.  We have made a distinction between the information and an apology, which feeds into the earlier discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J00800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Wallace wish to add a comment to what has been said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J00900","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I will listen to the Minister of State first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J01000","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>As no other member has indicated a wish to speak, I call the Minister of State to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J01100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I am concerned that the Deputies do not understand the aim of the legislation and have missed the philosophical point, as Deputy Daly called it.  I understand there was extensive pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, as mentioned by Deputy Daly.  The matter has been examined.<\/p> <p>  This set of amendments relate to the protections given for open disclosure in relation to admissibility.  Part 4 provides for certain protections for information given to the patient at an open disclosure meeting, including that the information and written statement given to the patient are not admissible as evidence of fault or liability in a court in relation to the patient safety incident or a clinical negligence action that arises from the consequences of that patient safety incident.  I think we are in agreement.  That is the nub of the matter.  Deputies Daly and Wallace have proposed changes to this provision.  Again, my colleague, the Minister for Health, appreciates the reasons for their concerns.  I will expand further on the reasoning that led to the approach that has been taken here.<\/p> <p>  Open disclosure should be a genuine engagement between the patient and his or her doctor or health service provider.  It should not be hindered by other concerns and fears.  However, a persistent barrier to open disclosure, one which has been recognised in other jurisdictions and which has emerged from Irish research into this issue, is the perception of negative legal consequences arising from engaging in open disclosure.  The origins of the provision in Part 4 on non-admissibility as evidence of fault or liability lie in the recommendations made by the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in its report called Building a Culture of Patient Safety.  The commission was chaired by Professor Deirdre Madden.  It identified fear of litigation as a barrier to open disclosure.  It recommended that legislation should ensure that open disclosure, which is undertaken in compliance with national standards, cannot be used in litigation against the person making the disclosure.  Fear of litigation was also a consistent issue raised in the HSE's evaluation of the national open disclosure pilot scheme.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health was sympathetic to the view that buy-in is essential to open disclosure.  The culture in our health service can sometimes stand in the way of people making open disclosures and this fear is part of that culture.<\/p> <p>  The intention behind Part 4 is to initiate a culture shift by supporting an environment where the patient's information needs can be addressed positively and as soon as possible.  Patients will receive information applicable to the patient safety incident in an open disclosure made under Part 4.  Moreover, they will still have full access to their medical records which, in line with good professional practice, will contain all information relevant to their care and treatment and will continue to be admissible.  On balance, it is considered that the system of open disclosure provided for in the Bill offers the greatest likelihood that patients will receive the information they seek after an incident without the need to resort to the courts system simply to get a straight answer.<\/p><p>A consistent theme from patients is that they prefer to receive information and explanations and, where appropriate, an apology directly after an incident and not have to go down a legal route to get this information or apology.  Litigation may sometimes be inevitable, but it should never be the case that a patient or his or her family has to go to court simply to find out information on a patient safety incident.  Ultimately, open disclosure is a human process underpinned by honesty and respect.  The intention behind the legislative provisions to support open disclosure is to create a safe space in which honesty and respect can flourish and lessons can be learned by health service providers and health practitioners and acted on to improve the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#J01200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I have one question.

It states the disclosure or apology shall not, notwithstanding any other enactment or rule of law, be admissible as evidence of fault or liability of the hospital or the doctor.  It does not state the apology shall not be admissible but that it will not be admissible as evidence of fault or liability.  I would have believed somebody taking a case on behalf of an individual who was apologised to by a doctor could produce that evidence at a hearing and state he or she was not relying on it as evidence of fault for liability but to ask the doctor whether he had apologised to the client after the operation.  That will obviously be a powerful piece of evidence in front of a judge.  If a hospital or a doctor apologises, or if there is disclosure, it will come out, but it cannot be relied on by the court as evidence of fault or wrongdoing.  It is, however, relevant in terms of the general factual matrix of the case.  The concerns of Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace will not be as problematic for a person taking a case as interpreted on a first reading.

What we are proposing would not change any of that in that apologies are indemnified legally and no admission of liability or nothing we are doing would change that in that it could not be used against somebody.  What the Bill does do, however, is provide that information gathered through an open disclosure is prohibited from being utilised as evidence in later court proceedings, but that goes against the grain entirely.  Denying in court a statement or evidence given in an open disclosure meeting will cause a huge problem.  Consider the circumstances if the policy works properly and we all get to where we are trying to go, which would entail health service providers changing a deeply ingrained cultural problem in the service.  Let us be honest about this problem.  There has been a voluntary open disclosure mechanism in place since 2013 and it has not really changed anything.  That is where our amendments are coming from.  There has to be a means of forcing open disclosure.  To say something produced in an open disclosure may not be relied on later by somebody in a court case is completely wrong.  Where there is something in a file stating a certain incident occurred and the person concerned is not happy with the open disclosure process, he or she may decide to proceed to litigation later.  The Bill should be about reducing the volume of litigation.  Where the legislation would make knowledge disclosed of a certain incident inadmissible, one would have to employ really costly medical experts to obtain information proving the occurrence of what one knows occurred.  There would be much more costly and lengthy litigation at the later stage.  Information is never excluded from these processes.  On the point I made earlier, it is still up to the courts to decide whether the action succeeds based on the information made available.  We are just talking about the potential to hide information from the courts.<\/p><p>We do understand the Bill and that it is being put forward as a benefit for patients.  That is what we would all like to see happen, but the way in which the Bill is framed is very much about preventing litigation and the fear of litigation which have been part of HSE culture in any case.  The implication is that openness with information, apologies and all the rest will lead to litigation and more payouts whereas it should be the opposite.  The evidence suggests it can be the opposite, which is what we want.  We are about encouraging openness and reducing litigation, not the opposite.<\/p><p>There was a good quote from the British Government when it brought forward its duty-of-candour regulation of 2014:<\/p><blockquote>One of the most commonly cited barriers to providers being candid is the fear that being candid and providing more upfront information about patient incidences can lead to a risk of increased litigation, and that offering an apology might be interpreted as an admission of liability.  On the other hand, it has also been suggested that being candid can actually reduce litigation costs, as often the main motivation for bringing about a medical negligence claim is to seek more information about mistakes in their care, or due to a perceived failure of the provider to apologise.  Overall the evidence on the likelihood of litigation is unclear.<\/blockquote> <p>Based on this, what we are trying to do is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#K00600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>On Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's points which were well made, the case notes or details of an incident will obviously be in the medical records.

It will be on the record  Future care needs will also be on the record.<\/p><p> We are on parallel tracks.  On one track we are trying to encourage, as the Deputy said, open disclosure and, where appropriate, the free apology and so on.  The medical practitioner will meet the patient and say he or she is making an open disclosure, this is what happened, these are the consequences, this is what needs to be done for the patient's medical care and away we go.  The legal process and all the medical records are on the other track.  We are trying to keep the tracks parallel but separate.  We want to ensure that whatever happens between the patient and the medical provider in making the disclosure, there will not be a chilling effect or impediment to full disclosure of all the information the patient needs or to any question the patient asks being answered and to a sincere apology being given.  It is about building up the relationship between the patient and the medical provider.  The concern is the medical providers might think they have to be careful about what they say and believe they cannot say something because it will be used in court against them or they cannot write something down in an open disclosure because it will end up in court, which would impede the other track we want to keep as open as possible.<\/p><p> The intention of the open disclosure track is to inform patients about what happened as early as possible in the process.  If patients then seeks the medical records, the information will be there and if they want to take the legal route, that can happen as well.  They may not want to do that and they may decide a mistake was made, an incident occurred but they have received a sincere apology and they need to get his fixed now by working with their doctor, who is sorry about this.  This is where we are coming from.  We are seeking a change of culture.  We do not want medical providers looking over their shoulders at an open disclosure meeting and wondering whether they should have their solicitor sitting beside them to advise them on what they should or should not say because it could end up in court.

Amendment No. 24 is the most important.  This relates to the discussion we have just had and, therefore, I will not repeat the points raised.  I will, however, strengthen some of them.  The Bill proposes a voluntary open disclosure system.  It would be remiss of me not to point that there has been a voluntary open disclosure policy in our hospitals since 2013 and all the evidence and anecdotes point to the fact that it has not done much good.  The UK system of a mandatory duty of candour is much better.  When the Bill was before the health committee, it was stated mandatory open disclosure could make the reporting of near misses less likely, to which the Minister of State referred earlier, and that was teased out.  The jury is out on that and the evidence does not necessarily support that.<\/p><p>Second, open disclosure of serious incidents is too important in the context of patient safety for disclosure by staff and health service providers to be left on a voluntary footing.  This has to be viewed in the context of the ingrained culture in the health service to deny and cover up.<\/p><p>There are too many examples of this culture.  The response of the health service to the hepatitis C scandal, the deaths of babies in Portlaoise hospital and cases of maternal deaths and catastrophic injuries has been to admit nothing.  This approach is ingrained in the Health Service Executive and will not change if we say, \"Listen lads, do not worry about it now.\"  We have to tackle this culture head on.<\/p><p> Failure to introduce mandatory disclosure will result in honest health care providers that make disclosures being penalised because other providers do not disclose.  This is a catch-22 scenario.  I have been contacted, as I am sure have other Deputies, by people who have experienced serious medical negligence, particularly around births.  Notwithstanding the voluntary open disclosure policy in place and despite having repeated meetings with the relevant health service provider, they were not told everything they needed to know.  They had to take cases to court to obtain the information they needed, which is precisely what we are trying to avoid in this legislation.  The Bill came about because of the policy of voluntary disclosure.<\/p><p> To give an example, one couple who contacted me had to pay &euro;10,000 for expert reports to get answers about what happened to their child.  They also had to pay for specialised health care for their child for the three years it took for the case to come to court.  Voluntary open disclosure will not address any of these cases because it is already in place.  Mandatory open disclosure and the measures provided for in our amendments, including the protection provided in cases where apologies are made, would go a long way towards addressing this issue.  Amendment No. 24 is of particular importance to us.  <\/p><p> A second group of amendments provides that the disclosure will take place as soon as practicable after the incident.  As currently drafted, the Bill leaves it to the health service provider to make a disclosure at a time it considers to be appropriate.  A more speedy reply should be mandated.  Obviously, it would not be appropriate for a service provider to have a meeting when the person is still ill or sick.  The provision that the hospital will make a statement when it is appropriate to do so, having regard to the health of a patient, goes without saying.  The term \"as soon as is practicable\" covers this but the current wording is too open-ended.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#L02100","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State explain the reason open disclosure will not be mandatory?

The definition in section 8 refers to a patient having been caused an \"unintended or unanticipated injury, or harm\".  One would have thought the patient should be told of such an event.

The Minister for Health fully appreciates the reasons some Deputies believe open disclosure should be mandatory.  Deputy Daly indicated there was some contact earlier today on the issue.  Considerable deliberation of the respective advantages of a mandatory and voluntary open disclosure framework took place before we came to a view that a voluntary approach offered the best way forward.  This judgment, which is one informed by the Commission on Patient Safety and international evidence, is that this legislation will be successful only if there is a marked culture shift - I return to this issue of a culture shift - within our health services and that the best way of facilitating that change lies with fostering a voluntary approach to open disclosure.  Deputies will agree that if we want to reach a point where voluntary disclosure takes place.<\/p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Joint Committee on Health also considered this issue in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the open disclosure legislative proposals.  The joint committee was sympathetic to the views expressed by stakeholders that cultural buy-in to open disclosure is necessary to its success and was wary of introducing a mandatory burden on front-line workers which could hinder the desired outcomes we all want to see emerge.  Internationally, a blame culture has been shown to stifle the learning that a good patient safety culture requires.  We return again to the philosophy of culture.  Open disclosure is a human experience for all involved, both the doctor and the patient.  As I have stated repeatedly, it should be a meaningful engagement between the doctor and the patient, not a tick-box exercise. <\/p><p>The committee recommended that the success of voluntary open disclosure should be assessed in the future.  If it appears the voluntary system is not having a satisfactory impact on increasing rates and quality of disclosure, the possibility of mandatory open disclosure could be then considered.  The Minister for Health has given a commitment to do this.  It is of note in that regard that recent inspections of hospitals by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, have identified a growing awareness of open disclosure across the health system.  Open disclosure is already beginning to take place. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 36 provides for a statement of what further inquiries into a patient safety incident the provider believes are appropriate and which of these it will undertake.  The Minister for Health considered this amendment and sought legal advice.  The advice given is that the current provision already covers such further inquiries the health services body believes are appropriate and which it will undertake.  Therefore, the proposed amendment appears to be unnecessary. <\/p><p>I assure Deputies that the open disclosure provisions are one part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents.  The Minister for Health has recently approved new standards on the conduct of reviews of patient safety incidents which expand on the existing national standards for safer better health care.  The new standards were developed by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission and will be published shortly<i>.  <\/i>This set of standards, along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and the provisions on open disclosure we are discussing, will provide a comprehensive patient centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.  This may address the issue raised by Deputy O'Callaghan. <\/p><p>The Minister for Health has directed the recently established national patient safety office to prioritise the early progression of these important patient safety initiatives.<\/p><p>I have endeavoured to set out the carefully considered pros and cons of mandatory versus voluntary open disclosure.  For the reasons I have outlined I hope Deputies will understand that I cannot accept their amendments.<\/p><p>We all agree that our objective is to achieve a shift in culture.  Let us be courageous and seek to achieve voluntary open disclosure, which international evidence shows is the best outcome.  We want to encourage this model, rather than mandatory disclosure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#M00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Following its pre-legislative discussion of the Bill, the Joint Committee in Health issued a report showing that the evidence to show voluntary disclosure is preferable to mandatory disclosure is drawn from one study published in 2000.

Given where we are starting, mandatory reporting is absolutely the best way.  There is no definitive evidence to say that voluntary reporting will work.  Take the example I gave earlier of the parents with the catastrophically injured baby.  That operated at the time when we had this voluntary open disclosure policy in our hospitals.  The parents went to three meetings with the health care provider.  Despite that, they found that basic and crucial information about what had happened was withheld from them, and they only got it when they went to court.  The reason they had to go to court was that there was no obligation under the present system for the health care provider to provide that.  That is what we are trying to deal with.<\/p> <p>  One can think about the scenario outlined by Deputy O'Callaghan where there is a clinical team in an operating room, a nurse sees something untoward such as a near miss and wants to report it, and the doctors tell the nurse that it did not happen or try to bully her into silence.  That one is mandated and has a legal obligation to disclose evidence of a near miss gives protection to employees who want to go in that direction.

For patient safety, there should not be an option about making a disclosure about negligence or something that has occurred to a person within the health service.  To make that optional is hypocritical in the extreme.  The whole approach to medical ethics is to ensure there is openness, and this would put that in a forthright way in the statute, which is important.  To make an optional aspect to this, which is what the legislation does by saying a health service provider may make an open disclosure on patient safety incidents, is contradictory in itself.  There should be more of a positive obligation on the health service provider and on the clinical team to disclose openly and properly whatever the incident was or is.  We should do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#N00300","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>In the absence of any other Deputies indicating a wish to speak, I ask the Minister of State to make a further reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#N00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>We are back down to two sides.  We all want to end up in the same place.  There is no dispute or disagreement.  The Minister is committed to evaluating the approach that is proposed.  He suggests that we need to allow it to bed down and give it a chance to work.  We all agree that voluntary open disclosure, if it works, will be the best outcome.  We propose to start with the best outcome, which is voluntary open disclosure.  The current open disclosure situation was referred to, but there is no protection for staff at present if someone makes a voluntary open disclosure.  If someone says he or she did something, there is no protection.  One could argue that is one of the reasons it is not happening to the extent it should.  The Bill sets a clear standard for open disclosure, so it is not just a matter of mandatory disclosure, but there is a whole package here and it is all linked together.  It provides for a written statement to patients, which is not now current practice.  That is also part of it.<\/p> <p>  I would like Deputies to look at the Bill in the round and to take in the cultural shift we want to get here.  If anything mandatory is brought in, it goes against the thrust of this Bill.  As it happens, open disclosure is HSE policy anyway, but we want to improve it and encourage it because we want more of it.  The medical ethics code, as I understand it, obliges disclosure too.  This whole Bill is a package.  It is not just one thing.  By having voluntary open disclosure, we are not forcing people to do anything.  People want to do it because it is the right thing to do.  They are protected in doing it as well, and we are building up the relationship between patients, service providers and doctors.  We are building trust there and that is important.  If one thinks of it in the round and if we can get to voluntary open disclosure as a practice, as we are beginning to see happen anyway, and I think people want to go there, it will be a win-win for everyone.  It would be better than if we made it mandatory and forced people to do things which should be voluntary.  I think we agree that, ideally, they should be voluntary, and if we put in place the necessary protections for people in order that they feel safe in having the candid and open conversations they need to have with their patients, it is a win-win.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is committed to evaluating this if it does not work and looking at it again.  He asks that we give this a chance because we believe, given the evidence, that this is the best approach.  Let us encourage it, give it a chance, put it in place and evaluate it as it goes on.  If it does not work to the extent we hope it will, we will move back from there.  The Health Information and Patient Safety Bill mandates reporting of serious incidents.  That is on the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017062900002#N00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1498744800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>On the last point, which we can come back to later, where is the line drawn on what is serious and what is not?  Maybe there is one I do not know about.  I understand the argument the Minister of State is making and where he is coming from.  I do not think it is a difference of philosophy between what we are arguing and what he is arguing.  One of the biggest differences is the animal we are dealing with.  It reminds me a little of the police.  When the Patten report was done in Northern Ireland, which looked at the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, the conclusion was that one could forget about changing how that force operated unless one got rid of the hierarchy, so that is what happened.  Members of the RUC were paid off to go, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, was formed.  It is not perfect, but it is much better than the RUC was.  I am not in Northern Ireland often since I live in Wexford.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is an incredibly dysfunctional organisation where I come from and I could not exaggerate enough how many complaints I get about the attitude of the people in authority in the section of that organisation in my area.  It is horrific and we are looking at the animal we are dealing with, and the Minister of State is looking at a more perfect situation.

Whether one is a doctor or a builder, people can make mistakes.  Part of the reason they do not own up to them, apologise and say they made a mistake, which is the right thing to do, is because they feel they are immediately going to be condemned by the world at large.

That is another day's work for the other committee, possibly.<\/p> <p>  It is not just the HSE we are talking about here; it is the local general practitioner and other health service professionals who might be involved.  It is wider than just the HSE.  There are an awful lot of very good people working in the HSE.  Individually, one or two of them might make the type of mistakes we are discussing.  The whole thrust of this Bill is to protect, encourage and support them in disclosing those mistakes and apologising, where appropriate.  That is where we are going.  If it does not work, we can change it.  If we can change the whole culture that Deputy O'Callaghan outlined so well, then that is what we should aim to do.  We should aim to change the culture, get away from the blame game and get away from a situation in which people cannot sleep at night because they made mistakes, are worried sick about their patients and are not in a position to own up because they are afraid of the consequences.  The patient in such cases may need information and gets angrier and angrier because something has gone wrong.  We want to move away from all that.  We want to reach a position whereby a person can make an open disclosure, the patient gets all the information - if the mistake is quite serious, the relationship might not be the same and might fracture - but, in any event, the patient will have the information he or she requires and will have an apology if that is appropriate and is accepted.  It may not be accepted.  We also want this culture to feed back to the next patient and the patient after that.  We want this practice to feed back right through the system.  I say to colleagues that it is worthwhile being courageous and trying to make this work and supporting it to make it work.  I do not think we are making a mistake.  If it does not work after a period, it can be revisited - and the Minister for Health is determined and has committed to do that - but let us give it a chance, be optimistic about it, support and encourage it and be positive towards it.  If we can do that and if it works, it is a win-win for everyone.  If it does not work, we can change it.  However, it is worth having a go.  Let us be courageous and positive.
