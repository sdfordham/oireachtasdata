It is not necessary for every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have specialist knowledge of every area of policing.  The system does not work in that way.  In the case of advanced driving skills, not all members are required to drive on a daily basis or to have the capacity to respond to emergency response calls in a high-speed vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for training lies with the Garda College and the divisional continuing professional development schools under the overall responsibility of the executive director for human resources and people development.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that following a review of its driver training programmes in 2009, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na introduced a five level suite of competency based driving, CBD, courses, with each level specifically catering for the required knowledge base, skill set and operational requirements of members undergoing the relevant training.

It is important to note concerns raised by the Garda Representative Association that more than half of all front-line garda&iacute; are not qualified to drive with flashing blue lights and cannot respond to emergency call-outs.  The fact that no training course is provided for pursuit driving, other than the training provided in the emergency response unit, was highlighted in October 2014 when a woman died tragically after being struck by a vehicle being pursued by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The lack of training was also highlighted by the Regency Hotel shootings in 2016 when it emerged that the driver of one of the first patrol cars to respond was not qualified to drive either at speed or with his siren or blue lights on.

I and other Deputies have asked this question of the Department numerous times but for some reason it will not give an answer, other than to provide the partial answer given previously, namely, that 2,700 garda&iacute; have completed CBD level 2 training since 2009.

This is a strategic response to the management of\u00a0prioritised prolific offenders.  The evidence-based, intelligence-led\u00a0objectives of J-ARC target the\u00a025% of recidivists responsible for 75% of crime; manage identified\u00a0prolific offenders in order to reduce crime; and enhance public safety by strengthening the co-ordination and integration of policy, practice and research.

Access to these services remains a critical feature for offenders in addressing their offending behaviour.  A greater emphasis is now being placed on pre-release planning, on putting supports in place and on making links to services in the community for offenders who leave custody.  On a recent visit to a joint agency response to crime centre, J-ARC, outside Waterford city, we saw the manner in which the service is keyed in through other services in the community, for example, in the sponsoring of employment initiatives.  There is no doubt, and I invite Deputy O'Callaghan to agree with me, that the best possible course of action for young offenders of a persistent nature, once they have discharged their debt to society and are released from prison, is the provision of a job.

We must put forward some form of deterrent approach to the issue, as well as the admirable solutions the Minister has identified.  We need to see whether we change the sentencing process.  If an individual is involved in a series of burglaries that have been committed over a period of time, and where it looks as though there will be no change in that individual's behaviour, we need to look at whether stronger sentencing is required for that person.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to recognise that the primary purpose of burglary is to try to increase the wealth of the burglar.  We need to think about imposing fines and sanctions that can be properly levied on individuals who have been convicted of these offences.  There is more to this than simply trying to remedy the individual and in trying to put him or her back on the path to a proper life.

The bureau has responsibility for the forensic examination of all seized computer media, international liaison regarding cyber matters and the investigation of cybercrime.  Cases examined include all crime types including banking and financial crime matters in particular, as well as the examination of equipment and media to assess images in the context of offences relating to child pornography and exploitation.<\/p><p>I am informed that as of 30 April, the latest date for which figures are currently available, the number of personnel attached to the bureau was 33, including one detective superintendent, one detective inspector, six detective sergeants, 21 detective garda&iacute;, one higher executive officer, one executive officer and two clerical officers.  Approximately 120 replacement and additional personnel have been assigned to the specialist units that have formed the special crime operation since 2017.

For my own part, I can genuinely say that on the doorsteps and in meeting with people in the streets people have been very courteous and very fair irrespective of the positions they hold.  It is also true to say that many people out there are still conflicted.  Many people have had, and are having, difficulties making up their minds on this particular issue.  They have articulated this openly to us when we have met them.  That is not surprising given the issue involved, which is complex, sensitive and deeply personal for many people.  Our cross-party Oireachtas joint committee dealt with the issue thoroughly following on from the deliberations of the Citizens' Assembly.  The recommendations of the committee have now been largely reflected by the Minister in the proposed heads of a Bill which he has published.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state some key facts unequivocally in respect of that legislation.  Before I do, it is important to say that if one reads all of the evidence given to the committee, all of the obstetricians who spoke to it were adamant and very clear that where a baby in the womb was viable, they would always the deliver the baby safely, no matter what the circumstances.  That is reflected in heads 4 and 11 of the proposed legislation published by the Minister.  In addition, it is very clear that the proposed legislation will not allow termination on the grounds of disability, which has been claimed at times.  The Taoiseach can also confirm that late-term abortions are prohibited in the proposed legislation, with some exceptions in respect of fatal foetal abnormality and care in a genuine medical emergency.  The fundamental point I am making is that the proposed legislation which would come before this House if there was a \"Yes\" vote in no way represents abortion on demand nor is it comparable to the legislative regime in the UK.  That needs to be said.<\/p>  <p>  Over 125,000 people, or approximately that figure, have registered on the supplementary register.  Many of them are young people.  When I was on Charlemont Bridge with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan last week, they cycled past us in their droves.  What is interesting is that many were from all over Ireland and, in many cases, will need to get back to vote on Friday.

It says that terminations will not occur on the grounds of health or risk to the life of the mother if the child can survive outside of the womb.  In such cases, doctors will perform an early delivery and give that child all the neonatal support our paediatricians can offer.  Once the baby in the womb reaches the point of viability, that is what will be done.  Late-term abortions are prohibited and are only permitted in two very rare circumstances.  One is in the case of a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality as a result of which the child will not survive for long outside of the womb.  The second refers to those very rare emergency situations in which doctors have to act and act quickly.  Written into that emergency provision in head 5 is a double immediacy test.  The doctor needs to be able to act immediately and a termination must be immediately necessary.  Those are very rare circumstances and something similar is indeed already provided for in the 2013 legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300012#K01800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527072900,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.

The Department of Health estimates that every day three women and girls consume these abortion pills.  It is a story that has featured but has not been openly expressed in the public domain in the course of this campaign, not least because the consumption of the pills carries with it a potential criminal sanction of 14 years' imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  This morning I had the pleasure of meeting Ms Elaine Bedford, who is from Killester in Dublin.  She has now stepped into the public light to tell her story and that of her daughter, Kate.  Kate was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of seven.  As she got older, she suffered from polycystic ovaries and was prone to infection.  From the age of 11, when she hit puberty, she was always warned against unplanned pregnancy because of her diabetes.  In late 2016, Kate became very ill.  Her mother tells me that she spent three days and nights in intensive care at Beaumont Hospital.  She recovered from that.  The following year, she fell pregnant.  It was not a planned pregnancy.  At that stage, Kate was 25 years of age.  She was frightened.  She felt cornered and snookered and believed she had very few, if any, options.  She decided on abortion pills.  Elaine recounted today, in the most graphic detail, the experience of her daughter consuming these pills at home alone.  She said Kate took the tablets at home, was in agony and was bleeding.  Kate seemed to be coming in and out of consciousness and Elaine could not lift the telephone to tell the doctor because Kate was terrified of that.  Elaine said this hell continued for three days, with pain and bleeding.  Kate's boyfriend and her mother took shifts to look after her.  Elaine told me she will never forget the fear and panic in her daughter's eyes.  She said that no mother should ever have to see that fear in her child's face.<\/p>  <p>  Kate is not alone, as we all know.  Women take these pills alone, scared and in silence.  They do so knowing that the eighth amendment prevents them from gaining access to the medical care they need.  The result is women bleeding in their beds unable to seek help, daughters pleading with their mothers not to call the doctor out of fear, and loved ones watching on wondering how bad the situation might get.  Nobody should ever be left in that position.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me.  I hope everybody in the D&aacute;il agrees with me on this point.  I ask the Taoiseach to speak to Elaine, Kate and the women and girls who will consume abortion pills today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300013#L01300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1527073500,"counter":135,"content":"<p>We estimate that three women today will order abortion pills online.  Three women today will receive them in the post and three women today will take them.  No matter what the result is on Friday, or rather, on Saturday when we count the votes, that will continue.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald is correct that these pills did not exist in 1983 but they are around for a number of years now, or are more readily available because of the Internet.  Certainly, if people did not know about them they certainly do now after the debate we have had for the past few weeks.  The number of women who decide to end their pregnancies by taking an abortion pill will certainly rise in the years ahead.  That is inevitable, no matter what the result on Friday.  Therefore, it is my view and I believe the view of most people in this House, that it would be better if it were done safely.  What we are proposing in the draft scheme of the legislation and what will become possible if the eighth amendment is removed from our Constitution is the putting in place of a doctor-led system whereby women can obtain the pills from their doctor, not from a website.  They would be able to go to their doctor and the doctor could talk to them about other options, which a website does not do.  Options could be continuing the pregnancy or adoption.  The doctor could offer the woman counselling and, of course, there would be a 72-hour period during which women could reflect on her decision.  If they decide to go ahead, it can be done safely.  It is dangerous to take the pills if one is too far along but one needs a doctor to check how far along one is.  It is dangerous to take the pills if the pregnancy is ectopic because they will not work.  It is dangerous to take these pills if one has a bleeding disorder.  How does a woman know if she does not go to see her doctor?  What we want to do is put in place a new system that is much safer than the one we have now, that allows people to discuss alternatives and that is compassionate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the availability of the abortion pill, there has been another change since 1983.  Pregnancies are now increasingly complex.  Women are becoming pregnant much older than in the past.  Owing to IVF, pregnancies are much more complex.  Women with diabetes, severe epilepsy and neurological disorders must be borne in mind in this regard, and women with cystic fibrosis, for example, who might not have lived to reach the point where they could have children now can have children because of the improvements in health care.  Therefore, there are much more complex pregnancies than in the past.  Professor Mary Higgins speaks about this so well.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, the eighth amendment ties the hands of doctors.  Doctors can intervene to end a pregnancy only if there is a risk to the life of the mother, not a risk to health.  To me, a risk to life is a very low bar when it comes to what we offer Irish women facing complex pregnancies.  If we have a \"Yes\" vote on Friday, we can change from a risk to life to a serious risk to the health of the mother.  That will allow doctors to sit down with the patient, weigh up the options and offer a termination if there is a serious risk to her health.  Some mothers might decide to take that risk but others might not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300013#L01400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527073500,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The child does not matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300013#L01500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1527073500,"counter":137,"content":"<p>That is really what we need to change in the period ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300013#L01600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527073500,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Kate will turn 27 in October.

Will he agree with me that this is one of the most important votes in decades in this country?  It is obviously about abortion but it also about the status of women and the type of society we want.  In the past two months, we have got a glimpse of what the \"No\" campaign think of women.  They are spreading lies and half truths and whipping up fear.  In fact, spreading out and out misogyny is their stock-in-trade.  They meet each morning in the \"No\" campaign headquarters, rub their chins and wonder if there is anything to be said to put on another misogynistic poster.  How about one suggesting that women will flock to have abortions once it is made legal?  How about another suggesting that women will go through a physically painful procedure as their regular form of contraception?  Even though we know late abortions happen in rare and tragic circumstances, let us suggest that women will hang on for six months of pregnancy, which is obviously a cakewalk, then suddenly decide they want an abortion on demand.<\/p>  <p>  The message behind these type of posters is thinly veiled misogyny.  Instead of acknowledging that women are intelligent and equal beings who are highly responsible, as well as being the nurturers and carers of children, sick people and old people, they want to demonise women and present us as a threat.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that the question needs to be posed to voters about the type of Ireland they want?  Do they want one advocated by the \"Yes\" side where women are listened to and not silenced and forced abroad or should the nation be reminded of what a \"No\" vote would mean?  As well as saying \"No\" to the right of a woman to have a choice, the leaders of the \"No\" campaign have said \"No\" to contraception.  They have said \"No\" to sex education.  They said \"No\" to same-sex marriage three years ago. They have said \"No\" to divorce, to equal employment, to married women being in the public service, to working mothers, to LGBT+ rights and to gender recognition.  I do not have time to go on.

As regards my constituency colleague, Deputy Coppinger, I want to particularly recognise her early role in putting this matter on the political agenda and raising it in this House, perhaps at a time when many of us would have preferred not to deal with it.  It is only right, now that this question is being put to the people, to acknowledge the early role of Deputy Coppinger, Deputy Clare Daly and others in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the women of Ireland today, there are approximately 60,000 births here every year, which means that at this moment in time there must be about 40,000 women in Ireland who are pregnant.

I do not believe for a second that one of the 40,000 women who are pregnant today is walking around waiting to decide on whether she will continue that pregnancy based on the decision we make on Friday or Saturday.  I cannot imagine any of those 40,000 women saying that if there is a \"Yes\" vote she will have an abortion and if there is a \"No\" vote she will not.  That is not how it works.  Women who feel they need to end their pregnancies will do so anyway but they do so in a dangerous way, whether it is by importing the abortion pill online or, not in a dangerous way but in a higher-risk way, travelling overseas to end their pregnancies, often much later in their pregnancies than they would if they were able to access those services here in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the type of Ireland we want, I believe a \"Yes\" vote says that we want to have a more compassionate and caring Ireland and one that helps women in particular in a time of crisis.  I believe it says that we accept the reality of abortion that already exists in Ireland and that we will manage it and regulate it here.  However, I want the people who are worried about this decision, and there are many people who are worried about it and who will vote \"No\" in clear conscience, to know that if there is a \"Yes\" vote this weekend, Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote.

The pills are very safe.  There is medical supervision in that there is a doctor-led service.  It should be acknowledged that they are doctors who stepped in when doctors in Ireland would not.

I think we all agree that it would be safer if they were legal and available here in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There are two aspects to this conversation that perhaps have not got the recognition or notice they deserve.  First, abortion rates in Ireland are falling.  The number of women who travel overseas to end their pregnancies giving an Irish address has actually been falling in the past number of years.  That is a good thing.  It is something to be welcomed.  Teenage pregnancies in Ireland are at their lowest since the 1950s.  We do need to ask ourselves why that is.  It is because of funding provided to groups like the Rape Crisis Centres and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  It is because of sex education in our schools, the wider availability of contraception and the availability of the morning-after pill.  These are changes and reforms that have happened in the past ten or 20 years that have reduced the number of crisis pregnancies, abortions and teenage pregnancies.  There is a certain irony in the fact that those who are most opposed to the change we are proposing - those who are so convinced that a \"No\" vote is the right thing to do - are very often the same people who opposed the morning-after pill, contraception and sex education - all the things that have actually made abortion less common in the past number of years.  One thing I do want to say to people because I think it is one thing on which everyone agrees regardless of whether they are on the \"Yes\" or \"No\" side is that we should continue in our efforts to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies in the first place regardless of the result at the weekend.  This will mean delivering on our commitment and implementing the recommendations made by the all-party committee to make contraception more available and to improve sex education in our schools so that we can continue to see a fall in the number of crisis pregnancies in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300015#N00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527074700,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I am also voting &quot;Yes&quot; and calling for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote on Friday but I want to raise another health matter of public importance.  The Taoiseach set up the National Rare Diseases Office when he was Minister for Health in 2015.  By definition, rare diseases are rare but the office estimates that something like 300,000 Irish people will develop a rare disease at some stage in their lives.  Recurrent complaints to us concern the lack of clinical supports and the tortuously slow process for the approval of orphan drugs for these diseases.  A case in point is the failure since 2009 to approve the drug Kuvan, or sapropterin dihydrochloride, under the process for national pricing and reimbursement.  Kuvan was developed to assist citizens with the rare metabolic condition phenylketonuria, PKU, where patients have difficulty processing the amino acid phenylalanine and must live on very restricted low-protein diets.  Kuvan helps many of those affected to live more normal lives.  PKU was first identified in the 1930s, although the widespread heel prick test screening did not start until 1960s.  Failure to give treatment to a child after the first 48 hours results in serious cognitive impairment and often severe brain damage.<\/p><p>In 2009, the European Medicines Agency and 20 countries approved the use of Kuvan.  The Minister for Health told me that at that time, insufficient evidence was submitted by Merck Serono, the manufacturers.  It passed on the market authorisation to BioMarin in 2016.  BioMarin submitted a new health technology assessment for sapropterin to the HSE.  Nine months ago, I asked the Minister for the results of the assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  My constituents and I were very disappointed to find that Kuvan was not recommended for reimbursement last September.  It was said to be not cost-effective, although even a 100% uptake has been estimated to cost only around &euro;2.5 million per year <i>per capita<\/i>cost.  From his past work, the Taoiseach may note that this figure is relatively small.  In several D&aacute;il replies, the Minister has told me that the assessment process is ongoing and that the rare diseases medical products technology review committee is engaged with prescribers, specialist centres and the patient representative group to try to bring forward clear reimbursement guidelines that would be expected to target sapropterin to the patient cohort for which it may be a cost-effective intervention.  I appreciate the Minister's diligent responses relating to Kuvan over the past two years but after nearly ten years of assessment and as one of the countries most affected by this condition, is it not time to approve it?  As the Taoiseach may be aware, one in 4,500 babies is born with PKU in Ireland.  This is double the European average.  I think only Italy and Turkey are somewhere near us.  It is said to result from one of our Celtic genes.  In 2015, the Minister told me that there were something like 350 or so referrals and 20 new PKU patients per year in the metabolic disorders unit at Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  It is estimated that around 750 patients with PKU are receiving hospital treatment.  Representatives from the PKU Association of Ireland, the European association and other patients and relatives have been in regular contact so there is a very strong request that this drug would be approved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300015#N00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1527074700,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that we have a rare disease strategy.  I think it was published by the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, a few years ago.  One of the recommendations in that was to establish the National Rare Diseases Office, which I had the pleasure of opening during my time as Minister for Health.  If one takes rare diseases on their own, they are rare but when one adds them up together, quite a lot of people have one.  They include diseases like PKU, which the Deputy mentioned, haemophilia, cystic fibrosis and others.  When one adds up all of the people who have a rare disease, it comes up to a couple of hundred thousand people.  It does not seem so rare when one does that.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of any new medicine, including Kuvan, a couple of things must be assessed.  First, its effectiveness must be assessed.  Does it actually do what the manufacturers say it does in terms of modifying disease and improving quality of life and life expectancy?  Second, is the price being put forward by the manufacturer fair because even the richest countries are budget-limited and if we pay too much for something, there is an opportunity cost relating to the other things we cannot do as a result?  Another factor is whether alternative treatments are available that might be as effective or most cost-effective.  I do not think there is in this case.  I believe it is an orphan drug.  The assessment is done by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics in St. James's Hospital.  It carries out a detailed assessment of the medicine and makes a recommendation to the HSE's national drugs committee, which makes the final decision.  It is not and should not be a decision that is made by politicians for lots of reasons we all understand.  It is always the case that if the manufacturer has new information and data, it can submit that and it will be examined again.  I understand that when it comes to Kuvan, that is currently being done and that the application is currently being reassessed.

As I said, it is ten years since the European Medicines Agency approved it for market authorisation.  The health systems in most of our EU colleague countries have supported it.  The <i>Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases<\/i>, of which the Taoiseach will be aware, published the complete European guidelines on PKU diagnosis and treatment last year.  The journal says that diet plus medicine is the best control of the condition.<\/p><p>On the wider issue of orphan drugs, including Kuvan, does the Government foresee making any changes to the quality of adjusted life measurements in the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics assessments?  I have put that question to the Minister several times because it seems to be the key point when one starts talking about cost-effectiveness.  Are officials in the Department of Health and the HSE working on a fairer way to assess the efficiency of treatments for rare diseases?  The Taoiseach mentioned the national rare disease plan from 2014 to 2018.  Are we preparing a new plan from 2019 onwards?  I know that when the Minister set up the National Rare Diseases Office, it started with five part-time staff.

However, the pharmaceutical industry takes advantage of the situation.  When a number of medicines are available for a particular condition, pharmaceutical companies cannot overcharge for them.  However, a sole producer of the only medicine can charge whatever it likes.

It would have to be done over a phased period.  The opportunity arises to do that now.<\/p>  <p>  We need to allow Dr. Scally to do his work in this regard.  Patients who seek the best cancer care in the world go to places like Sloan Kettering, the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins in America.  Doctors seeking the best training in the world go to American hospitals.  They use American labs.  We should not just assume somehow that American labs are inferior to Irish ones unless we have data to show that.<\/p>  <p>  While I do not know about any contracts back in 2008, when it comes to the current contract, the American lab that is being used currently is not cheaper than the Irish labs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300016#O01000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527075300,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I wish to ask about the Bill being debated last night that fell in disarray.

I will explain why it is 14 years.  The eighth amendment states that the right to life of the unborn, even at one week's gestation, is equal to the right to life of a pregnant woman.  Therefore, the penalty has to be the same.  The penalty for having an abortion has to be equal to the penalty for killing a pregnant woman, which is not infanticide because, of course, infants do not get pregnant.  The penalty has to be at the level of homicide or manslaughter.  The penalty in that regard is, by the way, up to 14 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300018#Q01400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527076500,"counter":219,"content":"<p>It is stated on page 48 of the programme for Government that social welfare payments at post offices will continue to be encouraged.

They show that there are 86,000 families on the housing list.  It is, however, much larger.  We were also told that there were 36,000 people on housing assistance payments, HAP, schemes and 22,000 on rental accommodation, RAS, schemes.  In reality, that means we have 144,000 households on the housing list.<\/p>  <p>  Given the rental spiral happening and the extraordinary difficulty in many parts of the country of getting private landlords and the private sector to deliver HAPs tenancies - in many cases they are pulling out of those tenancies - is there any recognition that HAPs is just an accident waiting to happen?  The reliance that the Government is putting on it in Rebuilding Ireland is an accident waiting to happen.  As a supplement to that, even if it was delivered, does the Taoiseach have any estimate of how much it would cost?  I refer to the target of outsourcing to the private sector about 83,000 of the planned 133,000 social housing units.  I do not believe that they can be delivered under HAPS and RAS.  However, even if they were, is there any estimate of how much that would cost on an ongoing basis?  Dr. Rory Hearne and Dr. Mary Murphy have estimated that it would cost us &euro;23 billion over 30 years.

On housing statistics, I asked the Taoiseach last week to give an assurance that 100% comparability would be maintained between current and previous homelessness statistics.

The first is managing our public finances prudently, having got into a situation where the budget is balanced and running surpluses on occasion, and paying down the national debt.  <\/p>  <p>  The second principle is full employment and we will reach our targets in that regard that quite soon.  We are expecting that figures in June will indicate that more people in Ireland are at work than ever before.  We also want to make sure that employment is quality employment that pays well, gives people a degree of security, is family friendly and provides pensions.  Auto-enrolment is a part of that plan.<\/p>  <p>  The third principle is raising living standards.  Living standards in Ireland are rising, deprivation and poverty are falling and income inequality is narrowing, which we know from the CSO statistics.  <\/p>  <p>  The fourth principle is investment in infrastructure, housing and healthcare, with a focus on transport.  Next year there will be a 25% increase in our infrastructure budget compared with this year.  We have set out how we will spend &euro;116 billion on public infrastructure over ten years.<\/p>  <p>  The fifth principle is the reform of public services.  We have now reversed the cuts in terms of spending.  Education and health spending are at an all-time high.  We now need to make sure that those additional, record resources actually result in good outcomes and good results for taxpayers, students and patients.  <\/p>  <p>  The sixth principle is the idea of Global Ireland and doubling our global footprint.  We will produce a detailed plan on that in the next couple of weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  Everyone acknowledges that we have a housing shortage in Ireland, and we are all aware of how that happened.  There was a seven-year period during which the Government could not afford to build social housing, the banks could not finance the construction of housing and the construction sector was on its knees.  Virtually no houses were built in the country during that time and we now have a deficit of approximately 250,000 units, in terms of additional houses and apartments that need to be built.  We added 7,000 houses to the social housing stock in a number of different ways, including purchases from developers, direct builds by councils and direct builds by approved housing bodies.  That is the biggest increase in our social housing stock for many years.  Having added 7,000 houses to our social housing stock next year, we plan to increase that to 10,000 or 11,000 a year, which the amount of social housing we need.  We have to build up to that number; they cannot all be built at once.  <\/p>  <p>  The conversation around housing should not revolve around social housing entirely.  We need to bear in mind that the vast majority of people do not qualify for and do not want social housing but rather want to buy their own homes and to save for that.  However, there is a need to provide homes for that purpose which are affordable.  In my constituency house building is really taking off again.  As 18,000 new homes commenced construction in the past year, we are a little bit short of what is required to get to equilibrium, which is approximately 25,000.  We believe we will get to that number next year and it will rise again to 35,000 the year after.  The plan is working but it is working slowly, which is an inevitability, unfortunately.  Housing construction cannot be ramped up as quickly as we would like, given that it reached such a nadir as a consequence of the financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a very active debate on homelessness statistics.  Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Eoin &Oacute; Broin are debating the issue all the time.  I am not particularly interested in getting involved in that debate.  Both figures, 9,000 or 10,000 people, in emergency accommodation represent too many people; there are many more than there used to be and I am not going to pretend otherwise.

It misses the point, quite frankly.  We have asked the CSO to do some work on tracking accurately the number of new homes being built, because that is unclear at the moment.  Some people base their figures on ESB connections, which is fairly accurate because it includes new homes and homes that have been off the grid for two years, which is as good as a new home.  However, as it can also include things such as outhouses on farms, it is not a perfect statistic, even though it is a good one.  Some people use BER certifications, which is also not perfect because one-off housing regularly does not require BER.  We have asked the CSO to come up with a reliable set of figures it can stand over when it comes to new home building and we expect it to report on that in the next few months.  As for homelessness, we have not asked the CSO to do that but it is a possibility that we could ask that the current figures be suspended and to ask the CSO to produce something more accurate that everyone can stand over.  I do not believe anyone disputes statistics produced by the CSO.  Statistics from Departments may be disputed, and people rightly dispute those that come from interest groups such as NGOs and others, but nobody disputes the figures from the CSO.

Does he think that it might be binned or shredded and that it might never been seen or does he have particular insights, having been a denizen of the Seanad over many long decades?  Is he perhaps out to settle scores?  We all heard about a recent episode in the canteen which seemed to be quite colourful and heated in nature, involving a dispute with former allies.  Perhaps he has it in for some of the former or current Members of the Seanad.  Can the Taoiseach enlighten us on the change in procedures?  Does he feel it is helpful that Ministers can now nominate themselves or be nominated to this kind of committee?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300020#S01000","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1527077700,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach addressed the Seanad earlier this year on the topic of Seanad reform and suggested that Senators from nationalist and unionist communities in the North should be elected.

He was elected with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael, and will bring a different perspective to that House.

It has taken far too long to set up this committee.  It is rather bizarre that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, decided to sit on the committee.  Some believe it was his last-ditch effort to stop Senator McDowell.  I do not know what that is all about, but I think it is unbecoming of him.  He needs to focus on his job.  He should do something about the second runway in Dublin Airport, the most critical issue in his remit.  Meanwhile, he is on every committee, nipping into other ministerial portfolios than his own.<\/p>  <p>  On the reform issue, I put it to the Taoiseach that at the commencement of this D&aacute;il we outlined a series of ambitious reforms for this House.  I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on the supports that we are giving the Oireachtas in implementing those reforms.  The Parliamentary Budget Office is up and running, but I recall that there was about a year's delay in approving the head of that office, with questions around the level within the public service they were to be accorded and whether they were to be at assistant secretary or deputy secretary general level.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform initially insisted on a principal officer grade for that post.  The same concerns apply with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser.  It should be an independent office of note in regard to the quality of the people recruited and the level to which they are recruited.  <\/p>  <p>  D&aacute;il and Seanad reform will need resources.  I ask the Taoiseach to convene a meeting of the party leaders to reflect on the progress we have made since the commencement of this D&aacute;il.  For example, there was an offer of assistance in the drafting of Opposition legislation in order to ensure that the final measures passed by the House are of a higher quality.  The Taoiseach has justified the Government's blocking of legislation from the Opposition on the grounds that he felt it to be poorly drafted.  That would not be an issue if there was more comprehensive assistance available as these offices develop and are strengthened.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government also promises to evolve better methods of sharing information from Departments with Deputies.  In reality, the sharing of information has become much worse.  Briefings which were once common have now nearly stopped.  Information is now mainly shared via planted stories in newspapers, rather than any accountable forum.  Can the Taoiseach outline the proposals he is bringing forward to implement the commitment to being more open in sharing information?  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I note that the Taoiseach recently lectured Ministers about leaking Cabinet information.  In a spectacular U-turn from his practices as a Minister, he has decided this is not to be tolerated.  Can he say what steps he is taking to find and punish the leakers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300021#T00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1527078300,"counter":251,"content":"<p>In regard to the size of the committee, I note that it has a maximum membership of 26 but it only has 22 people nominated to it.  It does seem like a lot, and it is a lot, but it is actually not much greater than the number of people sitting around the Cabinet table.  It may not be as huge as it seems to people, but it is a large number.  The reason for that is twofold.  First, every group had to have at least one representative, including the Civil Engagement group, the Independent Alliance and the Social Democrat-Green group.  We did not think it was appropriate to leave out any group.  Once that was done, there also had to be proportionality.  Very big groups like Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in should have more members than very small groups.  We then get to the figure of 20-something, whether we like it or not.<\/p>  <p>  It is not unprecedented.  The all-party Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, the all-party Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and the all-party Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution had similar numbers of members and produced good outcomes in a reasonable time period, so I do not think we should underestimate the capacity of people nominated to that committee to deliver the goods.  The Independent Alliance has one member, and that member is indeed the Minister, Deputy Ross.  As all members of the Independent Alliance are Ministers, I imagine they had no alternative but to appoint a Minister to represent them on that committee.  It is an unusual situation for all members of a group to be Ministers, but that is the situation at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Seanad reform, I very much agree with the proposal to have people in the Seanad who represent the diaspora and Irish citizens overseas.  That is done to an extent with Senator Billy Lawless, who has been appointed as a Taoiseach's nominee to the Seanad.  However, as they have in France, for example, I would like to see people elected from international constituencies, maybe North America, Europe and so on, representing our citizens overseas.  I also very much want to see the voice of Northern Ireland represented in our Seanad.  When the Free State Seanad was established, part of its original role was to represent unionist voices.  Half of the members of the first Free State Seanad were indeed unionist voices, particularly Southern unionists.  I definitely think that our Seanad would add to our Parliament if we had more people from Northern Ireland sitting in it.  We have two now, or possibly three; I refer to the recently elected Senator Ian Marshall. However, I think we could have more.  That would definitely add to our Parliament, and that is something I very much favour.  <\/p>  <p>  The Constitution makes all this very complicated, by the way.  People may not be aware of this, but the Constitution requires that Seanad elections are carried out by postal vote.  A postal vote involving perhaps a 1 million votes in Northern Ireland is not an easy operation.  A postal vote involving millions of votes from all over the world - Irish people are now all over the world - is going to be logistically complicated and very expensive.  Perhaps it is not even a good idea, but it would require a constitutional change to avoid it.  It is also going to require that we develop a whole new register of electors.  Not only would we need to register people in Northern Ireland and people all over the world, but our Constitution requires that people elect to vote on a particular panel.  Changing that would require a constitutional amendment.  It is not good enough that people are registered to vote; they will have to register to vote and opt to be an elector on a certain panel, and I think that is going to be very confusing for people.  The panels that exist were invented in 1930s.  They derive from a papal encyclical, the name of which I forget, and they probably do not reflect the way modern society breaks down.<\/p>  <p>  This is not going to be a simple reform, for those reasons among others.  However, the remit of the committee is not to come up with a new set of proposals.  The remit of the committee is to implement the Manning report.  This is an implementation group, and I expect that it will help to produce the legislation which we will  then put through this House and the other House, allowing the next Seanad or the Seanad after it to be elected according to these new rules.  Its terms of reference enable it to come up with alternatives if the committee finds that some of the aspects of the Manning report are impractical.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of resources, the Houses are obviously run by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I imagine the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a role in approving.  I am not sure how that works, but the Department perhaps has a role in approving particular posts and so on.  Perhaps the solution to that is just to give the Oireachtas more autonomy within its own budget to decide at what grade people should be hired.  That practice does exist.  It is called delegated sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300021#T00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527078300,"counter":252,"content":"<p>It took a year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300021#T00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1527078300,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Perhaps for next year's budget, we could just give the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission its budget, and give it delegated sanction-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300021#T00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527078300,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Could we agree to meet on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300021#T00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1527078300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>-----to decide whether to have fewer people at a higher grade or more people at a lower grade as it sees fit.

There are a large number of Ministers of State now.  The Taoiseach expanded the number of Ministers of State hugely, almost to Bertie Ahern proportions at the last count.  A large number of them now have special advisers, due in part to those who are also attending Government.  It is the highest ever in the history of the State.  We have four now who do not have advisers, so why do some Ministers of State get advisers and others do not?  For instance, the Ministers of State, Deputies Jim Daly, D'Arcy, McEntee, Moran and Halligan, all have advisers, so that would be a cost of roughly half a million euro a year to taxpayers.

He might also outline if the role of the Minister, Deputy Ross, extends to the Rural Alliance and others because it is very noticeable from time to time in different votes that there are surprising outcomes in terms of support levels.

I hope he will join me in expressing alarm and exasperation at the revelations contained in recent correspondence from the State Pathologist in the North of Ireland to the lawyers representing the family of Aidan McAnespie, who was shot dead by a British soldier on 21 February 1988 as he was making his way to his local GAA club grounds at Aughnacloy on the Tyrone-Monaghan border.  The letter from Dr. J.R. Lyness advises that while the State Pathologist's office has retained seven paraffin tissue blocks containing wax-embedded tissue from some of the major organs of Aidan's body, the section of the ribcage that contained the exit bullet wound had been disposed of.  Dr. Lyness states that this disposal was carried out in the years following the post mortem examination but that the State Pathologist's office does not hold any records on the disposal of retained tissue from that time.  The ribcage section was removed from Aidan's chest cage, adjacent to the breastbone.  This ribcage section measured 5 in. by 3 in. and was removed, I understand, at the time of the autopsy carried out by the then deputy State Pathologist in the North, Dr. Carson.  When Professor Harbison carried out the second autopsy on Aidan's exhumed remains in this jurisdiction, he discovered that this critical section of Aidan's ribcage had been removed.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many calls and alleged calls, historically and more recently, to have Aidan's full remains restored to his family, but to no avail.  Professor Harbison was unable to make a definitive judgment on the trajectory of the bullet that took Aidan's life.  Will the T&aacute;naiste undertake to raise this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, in correspondence and directly when next they meet?  Will he request that she establish when Aidan McAnespie's removed ribcage section was disposed of?  That no records were allegedly kept is bizarre in itself and is not credible.  Will the T&aacute;naiste request that the Secretary of State establish who carried out the disposal and under whose direction it was done?  Will he request that she establish in what way the disposal was carried out?  Will he request that she establish if the disposed of remains can be retrieved?  Will he ask that she secure copies of all relevant documentation, including photographic records of said ribcage section and any other relevant material that the State Pathologist's office in Belfast holds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300024#BB00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1527079800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The shooting of Aidan McAnespie in Aughnacloy near a checkpoint just over 30 years ago, in February 1988, was a tragedy for his family and friends.  I extend my sympathy to them.  I met the family in March to hear their views and concerns and I subsequently directed my officials to raise the matter with the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Given the great public disquiet on both sides of the Border following the shooting, the Government requested that an inquiry be carried out.  The then deputy garda commissioner, Mr. Eugene Crowley, was appointed to conduct the inquiry.  Deputy Commissioner Crowley's report was submitted to the then Minister for Justice on 8 April 1988.  A summary of the report's conclusions and a copy of the report relating to the post mortem carried out by Professor Harbison were provided previously to the McAnespie family.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has provided further copies of these documents to the family&rsquo;s representatives and is currently examining what options might be available to further assist the family.  I have told the family that the Government will stay in contact with them as this progresses.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the media coverage of the report to which the Deputy refers.  This is undoubtedly another extremely difficult time for the family, who have been campaigning for the return of Mr. McAnespie's remains in full.  I am sure all Deputies can agree with me that this painful Information must be made all the more distressing by the long time the family have had to wait for it.<\/p>  <p>  Dealing with the legacy of the Troubles is complex and a challenging task for everyone.  The Government remains fully committed to the framework of measures in the Stormont House Agreement as a means to seek to address the needs of the many victims and survivors and their families and to allow society to move forward from the legacy of the Troubles.<\/p>  <p>  Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long already for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland for dealing with legacy issues relating to the Troubles.  In this context, I welcomed the launch earlier this month of the UK's public consultation on its draft legislation to implement the legacy aspects of the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p><p>These institutions will provide a comprehensive way of addressing the painful legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, in order that victims and survivors can have their legitimate needs and expectations met.<\/p> <p> I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced and I continue to raise this issue with the Secretary of State.

That is unclear from the letter from Dr. Lyness, which, more than 30 years after Aidan's murder at Aughnacloy at the Tyrone-Monaghan border has come as an absolute shock to his family, who have always hoped that that release would inform one of the key and critical issues relating to Aidan's murder.<\/p>  <p>  I have itemised several things that I have asked for the Minister to pursue with the Secretary of State in respect of the State Pathologist's office in the North of Ireland and I also ask the Minister to ask her to include any other possible holders of relevant documentation.

When an investigation happens on the basis of guarantees around confidentiality, it has a standing that makes dealing with this issue difficult.  I have explained that to the McAnespie family and I think they understand where we are coming from.  We want to try to be helpful but we do not want to try to build pressure on people who gave evidence on the basis of confidentiality, even all these years later.  I will wait to hear what the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, thinks may or may not be possible and we have undertaken to communicate with the family on this.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that I cannot compel the State Pathologist in Northern Ireland to provide information one way or the other but I can certainly raise concerns with the Secretary of State.  I understand why the Deputy is asking the questions that he has asked.

It relates to the inconsistency whereby school bus drivers who reach the age of 70 years are no longer able to transport children to and from schools, although these same bus drivers may transport children from the same school on a school tour to the furthest distance possible, for instance, driving school children on a school tour from Carlow to Donegal and back on the same day.  There is no logical reason why the same bus driver may not transport children to and from schools on a route that they probably know better than anyone.<\/p>  <p>  It is a contradiction that the school bus driver who knows the area is not in a position to do that.  It is ageist that the day he or she turns 70 years, the driver must immediately forfeit that route due to his or her age.  Currently, we are encouraging able-bodied people to work longer.  We have an ageing population and we will have to work longer.  There is a contradiction where someone who is capable, knows the area and the students best and most likely is in a position to look after those children better than anyone else may not do so. <\/p>  <p>  I accept and appreciate that getting children to and from school is a very important chore and that when people are older, there is a requirement for periodic medical certification to ensure they are capable.  It is discrimination, however, against people who have reached 70 years.  The Minister of State has given the same response to several Deputies.  I ask him to consider a situation whereby when a driver reaches 70 years, he or she must undergo a medical test on an annual basis, in order that such drivers will be certified capable of driving the children they know best on the school bus on the routes they know best.  It is not too much to ask where we have people who are able.  The local school bus route, particularly in rural Ireland, suits a person who is retired who knows the area.  Annual testing and certification would allow such people to continue doing the jobs they are capable of doing.  This is discrimination which needs to be addressed.  Enabling older people to get out in the community is good for their health and mental well-being, particularly when they are arguably better than anyone else to look after children on those routes.  <\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister review the situation in order that the exclusion of those aged 70 years and over is not set in stone and that there is flexibility for a driver to be able to continue to drive a school bus in a safe manner, once he or she has passed a medical test?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300025#CC00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1527080400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I will begin by giving an outline of the extent of the school transport service.<\/p>  <p>  School transport is a significant service.  At present, more than 116,000 children, including more than 12,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported by approximately 4,500 vehicles each day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country, covering over 100 million km annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.  <\/p><p> As the Deputy is aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department.  It has advised that the minimum age for school bus drivers is 23 years and that candidates must have at least two years' driving experience.  In response to the expressed wishes of many school bus drivers - including those employed by Bus &Eacute;ireann and drivers for private school bus contractors - who wanted to remain in their positions upon reaching retirement age at 66 years, and following the advice of the medical department of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the company decided to alter the compulsory retirement age for school bus drivers who provide services under the school transport scheme in order to enable experienced personnel to remain in their positions for a maximum of four more years if desired.  School bus drivers who opt to remain on after reaching 66 years of age may do so up to the age of 70, if they are satisfied to do so, subject to an annual medical review and once they continue to hold the requisite driving licence.  That is the position as it stands.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has further advised that the opinion of its chief medical officer is that, given the demanding and safety-critical nature of school bus driving, 70 is an appropriate age at which to retire from such employment.<\/p> <p> I accept and understand that because they are living longer, people want to work longer.  That is the case in many types of employment.  However, we have a huge responsibility when dealing with the general public, particularly children.  As far as I know, at present it is not within my remit to make alterations in this regard.  The compulsory retirement age is based on the opinion of the chief medical officer.  This scheme is directed by Bus &Eacute;ireann under the auspices of my Department.  As the Deputy has suggested, there may be other drivers - and I am not saying there are not, there probably are - who are driving cars.  There may also be other bus drivers driving private school transport.  Such drivers do not operate under this scheme, however.  I receive advice and, as Minister of State with responsibility for the 116,000 children who are transported all around the country every year, I am sometimes obliged to take the advice of the chief medical officer.  Right now, that is the advice he has given me.  I have no problem going back to the chief medical officer and asking him again to give me the substantial medical reasons as to why he reached that decision and to tell me when he reached that decision.  I may be wrong, but I believe it was in 2001.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300025#CC00500","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527081000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I very much appreciate that the school bus service is a very important and integral part of rural Ireland.  We know that there have been issues around it in recent years and I thank the Minister of State for his engagement in that regard and for bringing the issues to a reasonable conclusion.  With regard to the substantive issue, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I appreciate how demanding and responsible the job is.  Over a number of years, we have seen some fatalities with regard to school buses.  It is important that my child, the Minister of State's child or anybody else's child gets to his or her destination safe and sound and gets home in the evening in the very same way once the school day is over.<\/p>  <p>  The substantive issue with regard to the point I made is that we have an aging population.  There are now people who are capable of working longer and who want to do so.  They should be given the opportunity to work longer and should not be discriminated against.  I met a couple of bus drivers in my area in Carlow in recent weeks.  One individual had been driving buses all his life.  Previously, he had been a lorry driver for C&oacute;mhlucht Si&uacute;icre &Eacute;ireann.  He is very used to driving around the country.  He has been discriminated against.  He drives for a local bus company and has taken kids on their school tour from a rural part of Carlow to Cork for the day.  That is approximately 240 miles to 250 miles.  At the same time, he is not allowed to bring the school kids on the school route, which would only be about 15 miles or 20 miles, on a daily basis.  I would appreciate it if, as he suggested, the Minister of State went back to the chief medical officer and asked him the criteria and rationale behind what he has suggested.

I accept that.  When somebody is driving and has responsibility for the general public - particularly for schoolchildren and so on - the Department, Bus &Eacute;ireann and I, as Minister of State, have a critical responsibility to review all medical evidence available and to be careful in every decision we make.  There are criteria laid down for all drivers.  I will not go through them today because it they not relevant to this particular question.  However, the medical officer said that, given the demanding and safety-critical nature of the job, he deemed 70 an appropriate age.  However, as I have told the Deputy, I will go back to the medical officer and ask him the criteria which were laid down and when the decision was made.  I have no problem doing that.  Now that I think of it, I was correct.  That decision was made in 2001.  Perhaps it needs to be looked at.  I cannot say that in my capacity as Minister of State, however.

The basic issue relates to an individual in my constituency who is in receipt of &euro;229 in family income supplement, which is a substantial enough payment in its own right.  It recognises the particular circumstances of my constituent.  He has a wife.  He is working, she is a full-time homemaker and they have seven children.  In recognition of the need to meet their weekly outgoings, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection deems it necessary to pay them the family income supplement, which is very welcome.  It is a very good and fair scheme and is reflective of the need in which families find themselves and of the support they need.  Long may it continue.<\/p>  <p>  The eldest child of that same family is sitting his leaving certificate this year and will be going to third level next year.  He applied for a third-level grant and failed to get it on the basis that the family's income exceeds the threshold.  This is an anomaly and it must be corrected.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection deems it necessary to pay this family income support in order to meet its basic requirements.  This is a family that will pay its mortgage, its household tax, its property tax and VAT on everything it buys.  These people are contributing to society in every way.  They are now trying to educate their family.  They have started with their eldest son but cannot get a grant for higher education.  This is an anomaly which must be corrected.<\/p>  <p>  I am not asking the Minister of State to come back with a review and an overhaul of the system.  We can talk about such things at all times.  Education grants are always to be reviewed.  However, in these particular circumstances - and I would imagine that there are not too many people in this situation as we speak - if a family is in receipt of the family income supplement, there should be an automatic entitlement to a Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant.  I ask the Minister of State to rectify this matter by ministerial order or any other method that might be required.  I ask that she does not put the family or the student under any further stress.  To use a common term, this is a no-brainer.  It is something which should be dealt with and needs to be dealt with.

I acknowledge he raised it earlier today with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, on the Order of Business.  As the Deputy knows, under the terms of the student grant scheme, assistance is awarded to students who meet the conditions on funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  The assessment of means under the student grant scheme is based on gross income from all sources.  Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion that might arise from different spending decisions.  The means test arrangements of the student grant scheme are applied nationally.  In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service payments excluded.<\/p>  <p>  The income limits for grant eligibility are increased relative to the number of students in a family applying for a grant.  Also, in recognition of the additional cost to parents where more than one person is attending college, an increment for each additional relevant person can be applied to the income thresholds at the rates outlined in the student grant scheme documentation.  The maximum increment that can be applied for each additional family member attending college at the same time is &euro;4,830.  In this way, the student grant scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.<\/p>  <p>  The eligibility of an applicant or the level of the grant awarded may be reassessed by Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year.  The applicant should, in the first instance, contact SUSI and notify it of the change in circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the family income supplement provides an income support for employees on low earnings with families.  The family income supplement was recently renamed and it is now known as the working family payment, WFP.  Under the student grant scheme, the WFP is treated as an income disregard in the means assessment process.  It is also included as an eligible payment for the special rate of maintenance grant.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the fact that the working family payment is paid to a family as opposed to an individual, a change was made to the 2016 SUSI grant scheme to recognise the presence of a payment even in cases where it is paid to a person whose income is not assessed as part of the means assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  I do not really want to talk about the family in question but the highest income limit for a family of the size the Deputy is talking about is &euro;59,595.

I will continue to pursue this matter.  The working family payment is basically a recognition by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that, education aside, the family needs extra money in order to meet minimum living standards.  As a State, we are saying the family in question does not qualify for support to educate its child.  It simply does not stack up.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the application process and guidelines.  We can have another debate on the very low grant rates and the fact that, for any working family, trying to get support to educate its children is next to impossible but what is occurring beggars belief considering that the State itself recognises it has to intervene and pay a working family payment to a family so it will reach a basic standard of living.  The last line of the Minister of State's reply is that the applicant will not qualify for grant support.  I must, therefore, go back to the working family and tell the husband and wife, who have seven children, that the State will help them to reach the minimum standard of living but will not help them to educate their child.

I appreciate it very much.<\/p><p>A top consultant turned whistleblower at University Hospital Kerry has told the newspaper <i>Kerry's Eye<\/i>that the lives of public patients are now at serious risk because of vital scans being delayed.  Consultant radiologist Dr. Martin Schranz has said public patients with potentially life-threatening illnesses are facing serious health risks because of delays in assigning them a patient number that will allow them to have a scan at the hospital.  He said that when a patient is referred to the hospital for a scan, he or she has to be assigned a number by the clerical staff in the hospital before he or she can be scanned.  He said he knows of five patients whose treatments have been delayed in the past five years.<\/p><p>The latest case was in the past five months and involved a cancer patient who was awaiting a scan so he could be operated on in Cork.  By the time he had the scan, which was weeks later because he was waiting for the number, he formed a complication, which may or may not have existed beforehand.  That is where the delay has occurred.  Dr. Schranz said a GP can ring and say he is worried about a patient and that he has only one option, that is, to send the patient to the emergency department.  The consultant says he cannot scan the patient because he does not have a number.  It could take a couple of weeks or up to three months.  He said one never knows when one can get that number.  If the patients pay, they get the number the same day but those who cannot afford it do not get the scan.  One does not know who is serious and who is not.<\/p><p>The consultant claims GPs are worried enough to ring him but that his back is against the wall.  What can he say to the patient?  Does he say he cannot scan the patient unless he or she pays, or does he apologise and say he or she must go to the emergency department and wait six or seven hours just to get the scan?  Dr. Schranz says this has been going on since the manual system at the hospital was digitalised four years ago.  It can take months to get a number, if one gets a number at all, but the average waiting time is about four weeks.<\/p><p>It is a simple matter but it means patients who could have cancer, appendicitis or another urgent or semi-urgent condition are not scanned for weeks or months.  Dr. Schranz filled up incident forms that the hospital should take seriously and investigate but he has heard nothing back.  He says the delays are seriously impeding him from doing his job.  That is not right for patients and it is not right for general practitioners, GPs, who are very frustrated.  Dr. Schranz said that a colleague of his in the emergency department cannot understand why their department is being bogged down with these patients.  Most of these matters turn out to be normal but potentially they could result in life or death situations.<\/p> <p> I will put three questions first to the Minister of State.  First, has he or the Department ever been made aware of the issues raised by Dr. Schranz at University Hospital Kerry, UHK?  If so, when were they made aware and what action was taken?  Second, does the Minister of State accept the claims made by Dr. Schranz and the concerns raised about the delays regarding scans at University Hospital Kerry?  Third, is he aware that UHK, through its public relations, PR, consultants, Heneghan PR, categorically stated in writing that the hospital does not accept what Dr. Martin Schranz is stating and has no knowledge of the incidents he alleges?  I have a number of other questions that I will ask after the Minister of State has replied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300027#EE00600","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527082200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael Healy-Rae for raising the issue of timely access to services at University Hospital Kerry and for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the position.  I am taking the matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, who apologises that he could not be here.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister acknowledges that, in general, waiting times are often unacceptably long and he is conscious of the burden that places on patients and their families.  However, it is important to note that in regard to the prioritisation used when scheduling patients for appointments, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has adopted a national waiting list management policy, which sets out the processes hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.  This policy was developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.<\/p>  <p>  I understand Deputy Healy-Rae has specific concerns about delays in the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry.  It is important to note that all staff in our hospitals are aware of the strict protocols relating to patient safety incidents.  All safety incidents, both clinical and non-clinical, must be notified through the process outlined in the HSE&rsquo;s safety incident management policy.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Minister for Health has been advised by the HSE that the hospital has not received any safety incident forms relating to ultrasound scan delays in University Hospital Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been further advised that management in UHK has been working with radiologists in the hospital to develop a pathway to assign patients for scans in a manner that is consistent with HSE protocols relating to fair and equitable access to treatment for public and private patients based on patient acuity.  A transparent, fair and equitable pathway has also been developed for GP referrals for ultrasound scans which are non-urgent and routine, and for urgent cases which are dealt with through the emergency department or acute medical assessment unit, AMU, if required.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, following a recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare, the Minister has established an independent review group, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system. The group has been asked to conclude its work and report to the Minister in September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the radiology department in University Hospital Kerry, I wish to conclude by reassuring the Deputy that the HSE has confirmed that the management at the hospital has not received any safety incident forms relating to ultrasound scan delays and that it is satisfied that patients are assigned for scans in a manner consistent with HSE protocols on fair and equitable access to treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300028#FF00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1527082200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Can the Minister of State explain why the hospital or the HSE have denied all knowledge of the issues raised by Dr. Schranz when correspondence seen by <i>Kerry's Eye<\/i>newspaper clearly shows that the hospital management was made aware of them in writing on numerous occasions as far back as August 2015?  Can he assure hundreds of public patients, including cancer patients, that the scan delays issue raised by Dr. Schranz has not resulted in missed diagnosis or delayed treatment that has adversely affected an existing diagnosis?  Can he assure patients that their health and welfare is not compromised because of the issues raised by Dr. Schranz?

I do not want to see our hospital in Tralee, in County Kerry, downgraded and left to be nothing more than a glorified community hospital.  I do not want that.  The people of Kerry deserve better.

Our agenda is that we do not oppose the introduction of the penalty points system, provided the system is fair and balanced.  That is not the position as it was in the 2014, the 2016 or the 2018 statutory instrument.<\/p><p>The system that is being introduced must protect the rights of the individuals and respect and incorporate the previous judgments of the court.  I will deal with those later if I have time.<br\/><br\/>This is the Government's third attempt.  Previous attempts have failed.  I will not necessarily refer to the Supreme Court unless I do so in my reply later on.  Time has been wasted.  We are told that the clock has almost stopped and that we will have difficulties with Europe.  What has been happening since 2014?  While the Minister might say there has been consultation and engagement, there has been little or no consultation or engagement.  Indeed, we have always been available to meet and have raised this by way of oral and written questions and correspondence between the Minister and I.  We are here today because there has been no engagement with me or very little engagement with the sector except in the margins of meetings held in the past.  <br\/><br\/>I will zone in on six fundamental points.  Section 5 refers to the determination panel while section 11 refers to the appeals officer.  The statutory instrument states that the determination panel and the appeals officer if such is the case would determine on the balance of probabilities.  We do not accept this principle of a lesser burden of proof.  It is grossly unfair to the individual to lower the burden of proof.  We will be proposing a statutory instrument we have prepared under which, in both instances, the case must be proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt in line with common law principles.  Anything less is not in keeping with our common law system.  We speak about an administrative system as opposed to the judicial system to which we are accustomed.  <br\/><br\/>Fishermen and fishing vessel owners should have the right to appeal to the High Court after this is dealt with by the determination panel and the appeals officer.  The current position open to them under the statutory instrument is grossly inadequate.  Basically, appeals can only be made on a point of law as per the Government or Minister's statutory instrument.  A full right of appeal must be available to the individual.  This is the most basic point of our common law in line with the UK and Malta.  We talk about an administrative system as opposed to a judicial system to which we are accustomed.  The current process, as outlined in the statutory instrument, is inadequate in respect of the rights of the individuals.  <br\/><br\/>Another substantial point concerns the role of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, as outlined in the statutory instrument.  It overlaps on different occasions between a detection function, which is the authority's statutory role, and one where it adjudicates, which is not its role.  We are most concerned that this statutory instrument, as presented, does not put clear water between defining the independence of the determination panel and the appeals office beyond reasonable doubt.  To put it in simple language, the proposed structure under this statutory instrument would be similar to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na detecting an infringement, being allowed to select the judges to adjudicate on the case and finally handing down the eventual judgment.  These are three parts that should and must remain independent but are clearly not.  The SFPA has three roles and a domineering role in the process directly and indirectly.  I must admit that in the Minister's correspondence to me on 17 May, he referred to the administrative role of the SFPA but upon examining SI No. 89\/2018, the role defined by this legislation for the SFPA is far more than administrative.  I refer the Minister to section 5(10)(<i>a<\/i>), section 5(10)(<i>b<\/i>)(ii) and section 5(10)(<i>b<\/i>)(ii) under which the SFPA has the authority to remove a member of the determination panel from office.  This is hardly an administrative function by any stretch of the imagination.  <br\/><br\/>I will now refer to the issue of penalty points.  The Department eventually admitted that we have serious issues surrounding the multiplication of penalty points when sales of tonnage occurs in more than one part.  If someone decides to sell their vessel or is decommissioning it, the vessel has a capacity of 100 tonnes and the owner has three penalty points, if one breaks down selling the tonnage of 20 tonnes each to five different individuals, every one of those individuals carries those three penalty points or whatever number of penalty points are attached to it.  This multiplier effect is still there despite what the Minister has said.  Points can only be applied to capacity once and there should be no multiplier within the EU directive.  Penalty points should be deleted when the case is taken to the High Court and is successful.  I reference the point I made earlier whereby an individual must have the right to appeal to the High Court.  <br\/><br\/>The timescales outlined in the statutory instrument are completely unrealistic in terms of fishermen's work schedules.  We must realise that fishermen are at sea.  They could be in the Porcupine Bank, off the north west of Scotland or west of four degrees east, where, fortunately, until now, they could fish mackerel.  Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to debate Brexit.  They could be there but how many days are they given?  They are given ten days to appeal to the determination panel for an oral hearing.  This does not make sense.  The period of ten days allowed for making written submissions to the Department is not acceptable.  These timeframes are completely unrealistic in the context of the lifestyles of our fishermen at sea.  We are proposing that both of these timescales are extended to 30 days.  <br\/><br\/>Under section 12(6), someone only gets five days to provide additional information.  This should be changed to 20 days.  Many fishermen are at sea during fishing season as opposed to doing paperwork in offices.  We are of the belief that when requested by an individual, an oral hearing should be granted to them.  <br\/><br\/>This matter cannot forced on fishermen or the fishing sector.  I am not here representing the large vessels, as has been said by Government and Government representatives.  This pertains to all vessels, small and large, if there is an infringement.  To peddle the story that we are only interested in the larger boats is very unfair.  The Government has circumvented me and talked to others about it.  The Chief Whip, Deputy McHugh, is from Donegal.  He is a Deputy when he is in Donegal and Chief Whip when he is in Donegal.  Those of us in Donegal are telling him that we cannot understand why the Minister is doing this.  It does not make sense.  It is a case of speaking with forked tongues but that is nothing new for the Minister of State.  I am disappointed he is not here today in his capacity as a Deputy from Donegal to defend the rights of these individuals but, of course, that is the way some of these people operate.  Worse still, blaming officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for this, and the Government is not really that anxious to do it, is wrong.  If we are really serious about something, the Minister carries the can.  If we support the Government, we will support it and not speak with forked tongues.  <br\/><br\/>However much they might know about fisheries, a spokesman for the Government is reported to have said in a newspaper today that we did not engage.  We have engaged and we have consulted.  We have a statutory instrument ready to hand over and circulate that I believe will accord with the Supreme Court ruling.  I have worked closely with all of these in respect of this.  We have that draft statutory instrument ready.  When I look at the Supreme Court ruling, and the Minister might refer to paragraphs 47, 51 and 52 of the Supreme Court ruling when he responds, it shows very clearly that the last statutory instrument did not comply and I am quite satisfied that this one will not comply either.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister but I can tell him that he has a party on this side of the House that fully supports the principle of this but it must be fair, equitable and balanced.  We are ready to engage with the Minister after this statutory instrument is rescinded.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300028#FF00700","speaker":"1289","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527083400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Gallagher's work on this issue.  I know he has been liaising consistently with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister to try to find a more satisfactory outcome that meets the needs of all concerned.  We need to take on board the needs of the fishing sector.  We need to avoid the possibility of it being struck down in the courts again.  The Department's track record in introducing a penalty-points regime has been poor.  Given that on two occasions attempted statutory instruments were struck down following appeals to the Supreme Court reflects very poorly on the management of the issue heretofore.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Gallagher outlined, we recognise the need to introduce a penalty-points system but it needs to be fair and proportionate.  Too often the fishing sector has been in adversarial mode with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister, which must change.  We need to have proper consultation and engagement, involving, if possible, a partnership approach with the stakeholders involved.  Deputy Gallagher has been very much to the fore in trying to achieve an outcome that addresses the concerns while complying with the regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The key points that remain to be addressed relate to the burden of proof.  The current approach in the statutory instrument deals with the balance of probability rather than having to prove beyond doubt, which is normally the case where a criminal sanction is being pursued.  The role of the SFPA permeates the statutory instrument at all stages, which was the basis on which the Supreme Court struck down the previous statutory instruments.<\/p>  <p>  The multiplication of points and tonnage is logical.  If five penalty points are associated with a certain level of tonnage and that tonnage is sold in three lots, the full five points should apply to each of the three lots, rather than being applied proportionately with the level of tonnage involved.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to address the issue of the timeline involved in appeals and the right to an oral hearing.  It is time for the Minister to engage further with Opposition parties and Deputy Gallagher, as fisheries spokesperson for our party, to try to find an outcome that will be acceptable to all while meeting the needs and obligations of the State.  In order to do that, the Minister should withdraw this statutory instrument and take on board the concerns expressed, make the amendments suggested by Fianna F&aacute;il and issue a statutory instrument that better meets the needs of the sector while ensuring we are compliant with our obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300030#HH00100","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1527083400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I also congratulate Deputy Gallagher on introducing this motion.  If we, as a Parliament, did not scrutinise this statutory instrument, the third statutory instrument in a series, we would be accused of being grossly derelict in our duties.  However, when we did so, all we got were briefings from the Department that my party was endangering the country's future and would bring all sorts of fines down upon us.  How much was spent on fighting cases in the Supreme Court over the previous two statutory instruments that were struck down which led us to this situation?  How much time was spent trying to get to this statutory instrument, which should have been spent on engagement with Deputy Gallagher and the industry in an attempt to resolve the situation before it came to this?<\/p>  <p>  We have until Tuesday for the Minister to lay out some sort of pathway to resolve this, taking into account the very fair issues outlined by Deputy Gallagher regarding the burden of proof, the rights of appeal, penalty points capacity and some sort of realistic appeals timeframe, bearing in mind the people we are dealing with, the pressure on their time and the fact that this is not a desk job.  Being a fisherman is the furthest from a desk job imaginable.  Their ability to respond to appeals or to charges needs to be factored in.<\/p>  <p>  Some reports have indicated that the Attorney General, who is quite in the news at the moment, expressed some concerns about this new penalty-points regime at the end of March.  Given that he has already referred to one item of legislation going through this House as a \"dog's dinner\", I am not quite sure what term he would use for this.  Maybe there should be some sort of liaison with his concerns brought to the Opposition's attention so that we could all find a collective arrangement to deal with those concerns.<\/p>  <p>  While it is good that the Minister, Deputy Creed, is taking responsibility for marine issues and is bringing them to the Cabinet table, he needs backup.  He has justifiably spent a huge amount of time travelling abroad establishing new markets for beef and fish.  However, issues such as this are being left to the last minute in this kind of manner.  Consideration should be given to having a Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, as Deputy Gallagher had some time ago, in order that these issues do not arise at the last minute.<\/p>  <p>  Many of our smaller fishing communities feel completely alienated from the work of this House and the European Union.  They feel they have paid the price of Ireland's membership of the European Union since we acceded to the European Economic Community in 1973.  We need to use our collective imagination as representatives, and as policymakers and use the new opportunities that are there in terms of Brexit but also in terms of other issues, such our response to climate change and tourism, to respond to that alienation and to tell our small fishing communities that they have a viable future and that we respect their right to play a part in this Republic.  That sense of alienation is getting deeper.  Many of these communities are dying on their feet.  The way this issue has been handled is adding to the sense that marine issues are not a priority, not just for the Government but for the central government system full stop.  If we deal with this collectively as an Oireachtas and deal with it in a progressive way working together, we can start addressing these issues and lay some sort of pathway to addressing that alienation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300030#HH00200","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1527083400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Gallagher and the other Deputies concerned for providing me with the opportunity to update the House on certain matters relating to the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2018, SI 89 of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Nine years ago, following a European Court of Auditors review on the enforcement of fisheries law, it was agreed by Ministers at EU level that a minority of vessels were not respecting the rules and were, through reckless overfishing, endangering the long-term sustainability of fish stocks on which all fishermen rely.  After much debate, the 2009 EU control regulation was agreed by the Council of Ministers.  The deadline for its introduction in member states was 1 January 2012, more than six years ago. <\/p>  <p>  The control regulation provided for a points system for serious infringements targeted primarily at the licence and therefore the licenceholder.  The primary purpose was to try to ensure a level playing field for those fishermen who were respecting the rules.  The new EU points system is designed to complement and not replace national sanctions and ensure a level playing field across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  This regulation requires effective and dissuasive sanctions complemented by a points system for serious infringements.  Serious infringements are activities that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks.  They include landing illegal \"black\" fish, not accurately declaring what was caught, falsification of records, concealing, tampering with or disposal of evidence and obstructing officials carrying out an investigation.  Crucially, this EU points system is applicable to all fishing vessels that fish in the Irish 200-mile zone, both Irish and foreign.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland introduced the EU points system for licenceholders in 2014, by way of secondary legislation, SI 3 of 2014.  It operated for a period but, as the Deputies have pointed out, it was challenged successfully in two cases by licenceholders who had been assigned points for serious infringements.<\/p><p>The High Court judgments were appealed to the Supreme Court, which examined the provisions of the 2014 statutory instrument.  One of the key issues was that points should only be assigned following conviction in the courts.  The Supreme Court judgment of Justice O'Donnell states, &quot;In my view it is clear that such a system of points allocation [that is, the stand-alone system] is permissible under European Regulations.&quot;  The Supreme Court judgment found that it is permissible to have a stand-alone points system pursuant to a statutory instrument so as to enable timely and effective implementation of the EU points system for sea fishing boat licence holders.  The Supreme Court stated:<\/p><blockquote>The possibility of points being allocated to a licence and remaining on that licence even after transfer, is likely to add to the dissuasive effect of the regime for enforcement of fishing rules.  The possibility of points being allocated even before criminal proceedings are completed, or even though the outcome of the criminal proceedings may be an acquittal, is not a reason to conclude that the stand alone system is incompatible with the European Regulations since that outcome will, if anything, increase the possibility of enforcement of the rules, and in dissuading operators and licence holders from permitting breach of them. A stand alone system of points allocation certainly does not weaken enforcement. It can also be truly said to be complementary to the existing enforcement regime since it enhances enforcement and therefore compliance. In my view it is clear that such a system of points allocation is permissible under the European Regulations.<\/blockquote><p>The Supreme Court found that the 2014 statutory instrument procedures were not adequate.  That statutory instrument set up, in effect, a single decision-making process with the onus of disproof on the licence holder and did not comply with fair procedures.  This is addressed in the current statutory instrument we are discussing.  It reverses the onus on the licence holder contained in the 2014 statutory instrument and places the burden of proof on the control authorities.  It provides for the separation of the detection of a serious infringement by the control authorities and the determination by an independent determination panel of whether, on the balance of probabilities, a serious infringement has occurred.  The determination panel now comprises three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General.  The licence holder may request an oral hearing of the case.  The SFPA provides a purely supportive administrative role, appointing the Attorney General's nominated professionals and providing all reasonable facilities and services to the panel.  These practical services do not cut across the independence of the determination panel.<br\/><br\/>This 2018 statutory instrument provides for an independent appeals officer to review the decision of the determination panel and he or she may, at his or her discretion, decide to conduct an oral hearing.  The accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy will lead to the suspension of a sea-fishing boat licence for periods from two months to one year.  In extreme cases, persistent serial and serious fisheries infringements could lead to the permanent withdrawal of a licence.<br\/><br\/>Deputies will be aware that, on 17 May 2018, the European Commission issued a letter of formal notice against Ireland for non-compliance with the required EU points system for licence holders of sea-fishing boats and a separate system for skippers of vessels.  It has given Ireland two months to submit observations before deciding if it will proceed to pursue the infringement with the European Court.<br\/><br\/>There are also serious financial implications with regard to the EU co-funding of Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF operational programme.  The EU is committed to contributing &euro;37.2 million towards the &euro;44.5 million cost of EMFF control investments.  This EU contribution represents 83.6% of these costs.  The Commission is withholding payment of these moneys and is moving to formally suspend payment.  To date, a &euro;2.7 million claim has been withheld and a further &euro;4 million claim is about to be suspended.  Ultimately, Ireland will lose the entire &euro;37 million unless we fully comply with these legal requirements.  This is the stark reality of what may happen should this House vote to annul SI 89 of 2018.<br\/><br\/>The points system is necessary as an effective measure against the minority - foreign or Irish - who break the rules.  It is necessary to protect the vast majority of our law-abiding industry and preserve the fish stocks for all fishermen and for future generations.  That is a good enough reason to support this statutory instrument; the danger of jeopardising almost &euro;40 million in EU funding by playing to the gallery is another.  The majority of fishermen in this country want to see points applied to those who commit serious infringements, jeopardising the future for everyone.  A vote to annul this statutory instrument would be a vote for that small minority of serious offenders who want to act with impunity.  I urge the House to protect the future of our fishing industry and to reject the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300030#HH00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527084000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300031#JJ00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1527084000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The issue, which has been around for some time, concerns penalty points for fishermen.  It is important to state that it is appropriate that penalty points would be applied to fishermen who are in breach of the rules.  Everyone agrees with that and we need to see it happen.  We want to see a statutory instrument which can bring that into effect in a way that is measured and that works for everyone involved in the industry, including fishermen.<\/p><p>The document which has been produced contains many parts that we take issue with.  In the first few pages, one of the first things we come across is the issue of proof and the fact that this will be based on the &quot;balance of probabilities&quot;.  This is one of the fundamental issues for most people.  We deal all the time with individuals who are in some way slightly on the wrong side of regulations.  Many fear that, at times, they could be treated badly if they have a past record and may have breached a rule such that each time they start over, it could be held against them and they might not be treated as fairly as if it was their first time to be outside a regulation.  Many people would have an issue with that and it is where the problem with the balance of probability arises.  The balance of probability is a very loose way of looking at this and it needs to be re-examined.<\/p><p>There is also the question of the independence of the determination panel because it is so closely linked to the SFPA which is a problem for some.  Ultimately, the decision as to whether there is a serious breach is going to be in the report that comes from the SFPA and that report comes to the determination panel, which is made up of three members who are appointed by the SFPA.  There are questions to be asked and it is only fair that the Minister uses this opportunity to clarify the situation.<\/p><p>Another issue that alarms me concerns the oral hearings.  The document, on page 6, states, &quot;The Determination Panel, having regard to the interest of justice, may decide at its discretion, whether or not to conduct an oral hearing for the purposes of the determination.&quot;  Many of us deal with the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and sections where there are meetings and a requirement to go before determination panels to sort out issues.  In all cases, there is an automatic right to have an oral hearing and the fishermen can go in to make their case.  It would be more than appropriate that this is looked at again to ensure they can make their case and that the oral hearing is acceded to in all cases.<\/p><p>Deputy Gallagher referred to the timeframe of ten working days.  To make a request for a hearing within ten days is too tight a timeframe and I believe it needs to be broadened out considerably in the interests of fair play for everybody involved.<\/p><p>Other issues that jump straight out include the period relating to appeals.  The period allowed to make an appeal under the regulation, at 20 working days, is too short.  There needs to be a recognition that we are dealing with fishermen who are out at sea much of the time and we need to find a way of dealing with these issues.<\/p><p>There is also the question of criminal proceedings and what role the courts might have, an issue to which we refer directly in our amendment.  There is a feeling, from the fisherman's point of view, that if all else fails, they can go to the court, have a proper hearing and put their case, particularly if they cannot put it anywhere else.  If they are refused an oral hearing, however, and the determination panel and the appeals office find against them, where have they to go?  They have nowhere to go.<\/p><p>That is the issue.  They need to know that in the interests of fair play, they can go to court, put their case and have it heard.  At least they then will feel there is a sense of fair play.  At present, the fishermen to whom I have spoken, and they are all around the country, are of the same view, that is, that the odds are stacked against them.  If we wanted to do this fairly we would make sure to represent the fisherman first.  We understand there is an obligation under EU regulations but the first port of call is to ensure the fisherman is looked after in all of these cases.<br\/><br\/>The only place we see anything about this is where it states that criminal proceedings are not valid.  It states &quot;points assigned to a holder of an Irish licence remain assigned regardless of any criminal proceedings pending, or the outcome of any such proceedings, in respect of the serious infringement concerned.&quot;  This is a draconian way of dealing with an industry that is on its knees and needs help.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to rectify that by withdrawing the statutory instrument and it is in the interests of fair play that he find a solution that works for everyone.<br\/><br\/>The statutory instrument also states that an appeal may be made to the appeals office not later than 20 working days from the day of notification of the proposal by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to assign the points to the fisherman.  Again, 20 days is too short a timeframe in which to get it done and this provision needs to be looked at again.  It states the appeals officer may decide, at his or her discretion, whether to conduct an oral hearing.  Again, there needs to be a sense of fair play here.  All people are looking for is the sense that common justice will apply.  It goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>The Appeals Officer shall confirm that the points shall be assigned to the holder of the licence where on the balance of probabilities, he or she considers that the alleged serious infringement in respect of which it is proposed to assign points&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(<i>a<\/i>) did occur,<\/blockquote><p>and occurred according to the regulations.<br\/><br\/>The fishers who are doing their best and who want to and who are playing by the rules fear that if they make a mistake, they will be dragged over the coals and made an example of.  That is not fair.  I do not know who wrote the statutory instruments or where they came from but it seems what we have now is a copy-and-paste job, with a few little changes, from what was rejected by the Supreme Court.  That is the issue.  We need to come up with something that looks after the people out at sea who are trying to get their livelihood from this industry, which is under pressure so much of the time.<br\/><br\/>The statutory instrument also states a person may appeal to the High Court on a point of law only.  If it is not only on a point of law it is only on the process.  People need to be able to go to court on the overall problem they have encountered and to have their full case heard and they need to know they will get fair play.  If that is not going to happen, the statutory instrument is not up to what we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300031#JJ00400","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527084600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l don Teachta Gallagher as an r&uacute;n seo a chur os comhair an T&iacute; tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na agus t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil deis agam p&iacute;osa beag caint a dh&eacute;anamh ar shon mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; faoin r&uacute;n seo a bhaineann leis an gc&oacute;ras point&iacute; pion&oacute;is ar iascaireachta a chur i bhfeidhm ag an Rialtas.

In March 2016, I was proud to table a motion in this House on a statutory instrument signed by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney.  He was attempting to impose a penalty points system at that time but it was struck out.  It was the very same statutory instrument, seeking to reintroduce a points-based system, which the High Court had found to be unconstitutional as it operated under the assumption of guilt.  It says a lot about the mentality of the Government and the Department, and of the way they see fishermen, that they brought forward a statutory instrument in this way and which our courts found did not meet the criteria in the Constitution.  In ainneoin breith na c&uacute;irte, t&aacute; p&aacute;irt&iacute; an Aire chun an reachta&iacute;ocht seo a sh&iacute;ni&uacute; ar aon n&oacute;s.  Mar sin sh&aacute;raigh s&eacute; cearta&iacute; iascair&iacute; agus na c&uacute;irteanna fosta agus bh&iacute; t&uacute;s &aacute;ite tugtha ar polasa&iacute; an Rialtais thar achan nith eile.

They are the key test for all of this.  The system must respect the individual rights of fishermen and must not unfairly impact on their livelihoods and those of fishing crews.  It must be a regime which allows for natural justice to occur and to be seen to occur and must, therefore, allow for recourse to the justice system.  That is the test my party has to a system that is to be introduced or is before us, such as the one we are debating this evening.  This statutory instrument, unfortunately, fails these tests and that is why it needs to be rescinded.<\/p>  <p>  It is beyond comprehension that any proposed regime would not allow redress in courts in circumstances where a complainant is not satisfied with the sanction imposed under the regulations.  Deputy Martin Kenny spoke at length on the restrictions on one's ability to take a case to the High Court, such as the provision that it must be on a point of law.  It is my party's view that such a provision is needed to give effect to the ruling of the Supreme Court on this matter and to deliver a system which is fair to all who are subject to it.<\/p>  <p>  I am in a privileged position to represent the constituency and the people of Donegal, in which there are many fishing communities.  I know only too well the challenges and the hardship that many of those involved in the fishing industry face daily.  The idea that a Government would seek to introduce a penalty points system that is not only unjust but is punitive and discriminates against fishermen is not surprising, given its track record on the matter, but it is nevertheless shameful and unforgivable.  Mar sin, tugann Sinn F&eacute;in &aacute;r dtaca&iacute;ocht don r&uacute;n seo at&aacute; os comhair an T&iacute; inniu agus molaimid go ligfidh gach Teachta D&aacute;la don r&uacute;n seo rith tr&iacute;d an Teach fosta.  For too long our fishing communities have been let down by successive Governments.  Indeed, they have been abandoned and criminalised by the powers that be.  I ask all Deputies to show that Members of this House hear their concerns, support them and support their right to pursue their livelihoods without fear or favour.  That is why we need to rescind this statutory instrument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300032#KK00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1527084600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity, on behalf of the Labour Party, to contribute to this debate, which centres on the implementation of SI 89 of 2018, the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations, which appears to supersede SI 125 of 2016 which was signed into law on 1 March 2016 by the predecessor of the current Minister.  There has been a significant amount of debate on this issue and the Minister has put forward his views on putting in place a system that derives from the Common Fisheries Policy and the application of an EU regulation from eight or nine years ago.<\/p><p>I find it astounding that we have reached this impasse now.  At the last hour we are putting in place a penalty points system that appears to be permitted under the EU regulations.  The critical issue lies with the format in which it is going to be implemented in this country.  There are a number of issues, but it is important to implement this.  There should be a points system where people transgress, and there have to penalties to take cognisance of the nature of the transgressions.  <br\/><br\/>Central to the application of any such system has to be a right of access to the courts if a person feels aggrieved by the imposition of a penalty.  The Minister said we can have that on a point of law.  That is his &quot;out&quot; in respect of the application.  I did not realise this was coming up today.  There is huge amount in it.  I looked at the statutory instrument, which the Minister, Deputy Creed, sent to us, in the past hour.  I think balance of probabilities will be hard.  There will be a determination body with three members.  The Minister assures us that they will be selected independently, but the SFPA will be involved in the selection and can get rid of them if it is unhappy with them.<br\/><br\/>If we are going to have a system, it will have to be robustly independent.  It has to not just appear to be independent, but has to be seen to be independent.  Perception becomes reality.  If people feel aggrieved by that, they will rebel against it.  It is very hard to see, in this context, how a quasi-judicial tribunal, which the determination body of three independent legal assessors will be, can work.  These are given constitutional recognition under Article 37 of the Constitution.  Normally, they work on the balance of probabilities.  That is intended here but in respect of this, where reasonable doubt is intended to be the criminal standard to apply, it will be very difficult to set it up.Therefore, it would be better to give people right of access to the courts straight away.  <br\/><br\/>I can see where the Minister is coming from.  There is going to be a determination body, then a right of appeal and eventually time will run out.  The three years will be gone because it is from the date of the detection of the offence that the penalty is applied, not the date of a successful prosecution.  That is an issue.  I cannot see how a tribunal can be set up in that way.  It is not going to be easy.  I refer to points of natural justice - <i>nemo judex in sua causa <\/i>and all of those things.  Anywhere there is a criminal penalty or sanction involved, people are entitled to those protections.  They are laid down constitutionally in our laws and we cannot deviate from them irrespective of whether we find that administratively simpler or whatever.  We have to maintain those.  <br\/><br\/>I am confused about this.  This would be a quasi-judicial administrative body going to operate to a criminal standard.  I concur with Deputy Gallagher's observation that all bodies contained in the statutory instrument must be robustly independent.  There should be no crossover in respect of roles or inputs.  There should be none of that.  He made reference to the SFPA having the power to choose or remove the determination officers.  No such power should be vested in the SFPA.  We have to move away from that.  On the time for appeals, there are 30 days for a social welfare appeal.  That is for people who are arrested at home at an identifiable address.  I am not an expert on fishermen - other than the boats on Lough Ennell or Owel, which is different from fishing the high seas - but some of these people are working from various addresses or working at sea and may not come back for several days or nights.  The five days, therefore, would be gone. <br\/><br\/>There are a number of points that can be addressed easily by the Minister.  As one of my Labour Party colleagues said, I am eager to ascertain the nature of Deputy Gallagher's rationale for rejecting this.  It is historic.  Statutory instruments have been subject to a virtual nod and wink policy in this House.  I have spoken on this on a number of occasions and said that it is not appropriate that statutory instruments be used.  I refer particularly to where significant issues of policy implementation are being addressed by a secondary legislation route.  They should be subject to scrutiny by debate.  It is hard to envisage putting in place an administrative framework for the imposition of a criminal sanction by virtue of a stand alone quasi-judicial body and perhaps it would be safer to have access to the District Court secured.  <br\/><br\/>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher has done us a service.  Forgetting the nature of what is going on here, but there are significant elements of legal implications and impositions in statutory instruments.  They have been whooshed through with nods and placed in libraries and all over the place.  It is a bad practice and it should not be done.  They have been subject to court interventions on numerous occasions.  I can see why; I know the background to this with the 2009 regulation.  It facilitated the implementation of a points system.We seem to have been dilatory in getting this in place.  I know about the Supreme Court judgment in December where the State was found against on a number of issues of a technical nature.  It permitted the State to implement a stand alone system.  It appears to be of an administrative nature rather than separate to a persecution through the courts and such a system could be facilitated by the statutory instrument system.<br\/><br\/>I will not argue with Mr. Justice Donal O'Donnell.  He is a leading Supreme Court judge and probably one of our finest jurists.  He indicated that it should operate efficiently and appropriately.  The veil of constitutionally guaranteed legal protections which one has would have to envelop any system put in place.  An oral hearing in respect of an appeal is an absolute prerequisite if we are to have a system.  This is very important.  We have it in agriculture where we are setting up a new system and debating it even now.  It is very important in the interests of the wider fisheries industry also.  Money will be withheld and we will have EU infringement proceedings from the Commission.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister, Deputy Creed, Deputy Gallagher, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and any other interested parties should get together immediately and reach an amicable compromise in respect of what needs to be done.  Any more delay will see Ireland subject to daily fines once the EU Commission moves to the formal infringement proceedings, as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, said.  Once that happens, money and scarce resources will be wasted.  Ireland must comply fully with its obligations under EU law.  We have had proceedings in 2014, 2016 and now in 2018.  Let us put our heads together and resolve this once and for all.  I support that move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300032#KK00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527085200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Thomas Pringle, who is sharing his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300033#LL00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1527085200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Wallace.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher for bringing forward this motion, which is vitally important.  The motion calls for the rescinding of Sl 89 of 2018, which sets up a penalty points system within the fishing Industry.  The previous scheme had been challenged through the courts and found to be wanting and this is the replacement.  I wonder why we cannot get this right, and it points to very serious problems within the Minister's Department. <\/p>  <p>  One of the things I find very disingenuous about the Government's reaction to this motion is the pretence that things are urgent and time is of the essence in setting up the penalty points system.  The Government has had years to do this properly.  In fact, the Minister, in his response to a question from me about this last November, stated that it has been going on since 2009.  We are eight years down the road now and we are being told that this is a matter of urgency.  A couple of hundred million is dependant on it being done now and we cannot rescind the statutory instrument.  As I said, it has been around since 2009 and this has been going on since then.  I think Fianna F&aacute;il was in Government in 2009 and failed to deal with this also.<\/p><p>Granted it was cancelled by the courts and perhaps that could not have been foreseen, although I have my doubts about that.  The original scheme was struck down by the courts because it did not contain fair procedures capable of being written into the system from the very start.<\/p> <p> This always seems to happen with fishing, which is interesting.  I might be wrong, but it seems to me that there is no other aspect of the Government work that relies on the courts to sort it out.  Indeed, the parent Department that fisheries is under can now work without the courts at all and I wonder when that will permeate through to that Department.  The Minister will say that that is because all fishermen are confrontational but I do not believe they are any more confrontational than farmers.  When this issue is sorted out, perhaps there is work for the Minister to do in terms of figuring out why the courts are such an integral part of our fishing industry.  <\/p> <p> This is the third attempt we have made to deal with the penalty point system.  One wonders why it takes three attempts to deal with a system that is largely laid out in European legislation.  There are many things wrong with this system.  How is it that an application for an appeal is allowed up to 20 working days but an application for an oral hearing of an appeal has to be made within ten working days of that date?  Surely 20 working days would not be too long or cumbersome for the State but it would make a huge difference for a skipper or boat owner.  Different dates will lead to difficulties; there are five, ten and 20-day limits within the statutory obligations.  <\/p> <p> In cases of the transfer of the entitlements to fish, the points will be assigned on each part of the transfer, which is crazy.  For example, if four points have been assigned to a vessel and it is then sold and the tonnage is split between a number of vessels the four points will apply to each part of the transfer.  It is simply amazing, really, that the Department would allow this to happen.  Surely the Department knows how vessels are sold and tonnage is split up, or indeed the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.   Yesterday the Department said that it had nothing to do with enforcement or criminal applications within the procedure.  The SFPA obviously has sole responsibility, so it should know all about it.  In the case of criminal proceedings, it is possible for it to be found a couple of years later that nothing happened but yet a boat would still have penalty points for it.  It does not make any sense.  The Minister has pushed this through without consulting with Members of this House or the D&aacute;il committee.  I have been raising this issue for a number of years at the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the first I heard of it was when it was put on the agenda.  The Minister has not consulted with anyone about this.  <\/p> <p> I really wonder whether the Department actually wants to make a system that works and is acceptable to everyone or whether it wants to have everything its own way.  I believe that is at the root of the problem.  Time is running out.  That is not the problem of fishermen or the owners of vessels; it is clear that it is the responsibility of the Department.  There is a matter of justice involved in this process, which is not at dispute.  All anyone wants is a system that allows for a fair hearing and I do not see any proposals from the Minister that includes that.  <\/p> <p> The Minister should take the points system back to the drawing board and design a system that will work for fishing communities to ensure that we have a system that is fair to everyone.  If he cannot do that without losing out on funding from the EU, the only person to blame is himself, as well as his Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300033#LL00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527085800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The substance of the new statutory instrument does not give one confidence it would survive another High Court challenge with respect to the fairness of proceedings.  The Minister, instead of introducing primary legislation or substantially altering the statutory instrument, has acted in haste and is using the threat of fines and withdrawal of funds from the EU as a stick after the fact in forcing this through.  This is not to criticise the penalty points system in itself; it is a necessary system which is important in terms of the enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy and, critically, to restore and maintain fish stocks above levels capable of supporting maximum sustainable yield.<\/p>  <p>  Things get murky at this point.  The debate here is not really getting to the crux of the matter.  Fish stocks are plummeting and overfishing is a reality in Ireland.  Fish quotas are in place because there is a limited number of fish in our waters.  We cannot increase the fish quotas until the fish stocks increase.  The fish stocks cannot increase until we tackle the real issues facing fish stocks.  We need effective legislation to tackle fishing operators who overfish.  That means taking on major industrial polluters who warm the waters around our island and further afield.  It means taking on the agricultural industry over eutrophication and water extraction on our rivers.  It means shutting down all coastal salmon farms that spread sea lice and forget to report salmon escapes.  It means doing something to tackle the domestic use of harmful cleaning detergents, to tackle sewage discharge and anything that contributes to global warming.  <\/p>  <p>  Sadly, the Government is largely responsible for much of the overfishing.  During the December 2017 negotiations on total allowable catch, TAC, for commercial fish stocks, where comparable scientific advice was available, 57 TACs were set above advice, amounting to over 206,000 tonnes of excess TAC.  This is continuing the trend of permitting overfishing in EU waters, with Atlantic TACs set 9% above scientific advice on average.  The Irish Government secured a TAC 18% in excess of available scientific advice, impeding the transition to sustainable fisheries in the EU and endangering the future of jobs in this industry. <\/p>  <p>  According to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the level of non-compliance with regulations within the Irish fishing fleet is consistently low and most of the people in the industry want to work within the law.  On the other hand, the infringement rate in Ireland is so low in comparison to other EU countries &ndash; nearly ten times lower in some cases - that one wonders if Irish fishermen the most law abiding in Europe or if they are getting a free ride.  Whatever about the inadequacy of the statutory instrument, most of the infringements are for pretty straightforward offences.  The most recent report from the SFPA cited 23 incidents arising from inspections that led to 42 infringements being investigated.  These were mostly to do with inadequate log book record keeping.  Giving the inspection officials from the SFPA the benefit of the doubt for a minute and presuming they know what they are doing, if one gets penalty points on ones licence and one does not want to be struck out, the obvious thing to do is to obey the regulations.  The Minister had secured the quotas that will ensure that there will be no livelihood in the industry in years to come due to overfishing.  Why should one not keep doing Government-mandated overfishing, keep one's head down and wait for the points to expire? <\/p>  <p>  A few powerful players in the industry have found a mechanism to get the penalty points system thrown out again and again, and the Department is not responding to the issue in a way that does not put the whole points system at risk, and is acting in a rushed and irresponsible under the pressure of fines and withdrawal of funding from the EU.  At the same time, it is difficult for people to have much faith in the spirit of the Common Fisheries Policy regulations when the Government is securing quotas that endangers the whole industry in the long term. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300034#MM00200","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of German Delegation","time":1527085800,"counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300034#MM00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1527085800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Members of the House extend a very warm welcome to the members of the committee on public petitions of the Bundestag.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300034#MM00350","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2018: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1527085800,"counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300034#MM00375"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527085800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher on Wednesday, 23 May 2018:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527085800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:<\/p><p>(Deputy Martin Kenny)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1527085800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to talk on this very important matter.

It is wrong to think that small infringements by these people will be dealt with via a statutory instrument.

These were once mighty ports with mighty fishing vessels coming out of them, all the way down to Unionhall and Kinsale.  That has withered away, bit by bit, because successive Governments have not stood by the fishermen.<\/p>  <p>  I have no problem making it known that I am totally against the recently published statutory instrument, which was set to introduce a penalty points system for fishing infringements.  This proposed points system is completely unfair to fishermen.  Not only can points be allocated to the fisherman's licence, they can be imposed on the fishing vessel itself.  Why should fishermen suffer for the actions of others?  Have our fishermen not suffered enough?  They have suffered at the hands of a previous Government in 2007, when a drift-net ban was put in place.  It was promised at the time that this would be reviewed after seven years.  It is now 2018 and nothing has been done about it.  In short, fishermen need more support from our Government.  The drift net ban needs to be reviewed immediately if fishing and coastal communities are to survive.<\/p>  <p>  Two High Court judges and the Supreme Court struck down the previous penalty point statutory system introduced by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, in a case brought before the courts by two Castletownbere fishermen.  It is quite extraordinary that despite that fact, the current Minister, Deputy Creed, has decided to try to enforce European Union penalty points legislation by means of another statutory instrument without proper debate in this House and without a proper consultation with the industry.  I am extremely happy that the two Castletownbere fishermen ensured that the previous statutory instrument was struck down by the Supreme Court.  I am reflecting the anger within the fishing community up and down our coastline.  The fishermen had to go to the courts and expend enormous amounts of hard-earned money.  The Minister and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, were wholly dismissive of the concerns of fishermen when they first decided to introduce penalty points.  Unfortunately, despite the kicking the Minister and the SFPA received from the courts when the previous legislation was struck down, it appears that this Minister is hell-bent on reintroducing the legal concept of administrative sanctions while repeating mistakes made with the previous legislation.<\/p>  <p>  For the ill-informed, I wish to make clear that this statutory instrument repeats mistakes made in the previous one.  This Minister insists on attempting to repeat the imposition of concepts of punishment that are wholly novel in an Irish context.  The result of the introduction of these regulations and this form of punishment is that fishermen will once again suffer from a double exposure to crime and punishment.  They can and will be prosecuted before our criminal courts by a closed administration system organised and run by people nominated and staffed by the Minister or the State.  We need to support the hard-working fishermen of this country.  I understand that some form of control system needs to be implemented, such as maybe a yellow card system.  There should be proper deliberation, giving everyone the opportunity to speak about the system and the problems with it.<\/p>  <p>  We need to stop pandering to Europe.  That is all we are doing - pandering to Europe the whole time.  With any issue, whether it is agriculture or fisheries, we pander to Europe and lie down for it.  We need to consult with the men of the sea who have been chased out of our own waters for years with little or no support.  Brexit is going to prove to be another nightmare for Irish fishermen.  I call on the Minster to stop compounding the difficulty with further severe punishments and to stand by our fishermen. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300035#NN00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1527086400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>At the outset, I compliment and acknowledge the great work of Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, not only with regard to this motion, but over the years when he has always been to the forefront of this and related issues.  My job today is to speak up for small fishermen who have been blackguarded not just by this Government, but by successive Governments over the years.  When I think of fishermen, I am thinking of the people I was elected to represent.  They are in Dingle today.  They are fishing out of Tahilla Cove in Sneem.  They are in Castletownbere.  They are people I speak to on a daily basis in Cromane, dealing with the trouble they have in trying to make a living.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of the day all everybody is looking for is a thing called fair play.  Unfortunately, over the years, small fishermen have been blackguarded.  They have been let down, not just by the Minister, but by his predecessors of all political persuasions.  There is nothing wrong with a small fisherman trying to make a living.  Indeed, they are treated like criminals.  I see what happens in the dead of night when these people are out at sea.  They are just doing their work in bad weather and all types of weather.  Their vessels are boarded and they are treated like criminals.  Again, that is wrong.  At the end of the day, they are Irish people, Irish fishermen trying to make a living.<\/p>  <p>  Europe has dictated to us for long enough.  We sold out an awful lot when we gave away an awful lot of our territorial waters.  I have seen this first hand and I have raised it over the last several weeks.  I have dealt with the Minister and his office with regard to particular details.  I want to thank him for the work he has done on many of the problems concerning fishermen about which I have approached him personally.  It would be unfair of me not to acknowledge that and I do so.  I am thankful for the Minister's help.<\/p>  <p>  However, he knows that what I am trying to highlight is the inadequacies in the system, whether they affect the fishermen at sea or the small people working with pots who are trying to make a living and who are being blackguarded, not just on a weekly basis but on a daily basis.  They should be treated in the same way as the small farmer, in that they should be allowed to make their living.  I call on the Minister at this late hour.  Anytime he makes a decision such as this order concerning penalty points, I ask him always to remember that there are small fishermen out there who want to pass on their tradition.  They want their business, which is a small business, to continue with family members.  Unless they get assistance from the Minister, his Department and future Governments, they will not be able to survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300035#NN00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1527086400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>It is funny how things do not change here.  Sometimes things go in cycles.  I remember that in the early part of the last decade, in 2003 and 2004, the whole issue of fisheries management was centre-stage.  I remember the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Noel Dempsey, had a bit of a struggle in his own party.  There was a very heated contest around the introduction of new regulatory measures.  At the time, I very much supported him in introducing the sort of sea fisheries protection authority which we are now discussing.  I remember at the time sitting on a committee when the manager from one of the banks in Killybegs came begging us for help.  He realised he had made a mistake.  He had lent &euro;400 million to the fleet there.  A photograph of the fleet would show that any one of the vessels would catch more or less the entire Irish quota.  The maths did not add up.  The &euro;400 million would not be paid back by what would be caught within the quota.  The fishermen at the time said they were sick and tired of the illegality.  They were sick and tired of catching four or five times the quota and operating through different forms of subterfuge.  They said it was time to clean up their act.<\/p>  <p>  Here we are 14 years later and we are still not cleaning up our act.  I stand with the Minister on this issue.  I think it would be a real tragedy for this D&aacute;il to vote down a proper regulation of our fisheries, a proper penalty points system, and I say that for the sake of the fishermen.  In the long run, if we continue to allow fishing to exceed quotas and to ignore the environmental prerogative to protect our fish stocks, there will be no fishing industry.  It is in the industry's interest for us to have a sustainable, properly regulated and properly policed system so that fair play can apply and the fishermen and women who adhere to the rules know that they are not being undermined by a system which allows someone who is willing to bend the rules to get away with it.  It beggars belief that 15 years on we still do not seem to recognise the basic principle that protecting our environment equals protecting our rural communities in the long run.  That is why I support the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  People say that the Minister has not heeded the Supreme Court judgments.  I find that hard to believe.  I am not a lawyer.  I trust the Supreme Court to make the decision, but I have confidence that the Department has taken them into account in resetting these regulations.<\/p><p>I heard what the Minister of State said - I accept her word on it - to the effect  that we have adjusted to take account of the Supreme Court recommendations.  If there is a sound legal argument against that, I am sure someone will take a case and let the matter be decided by the courts.  It is not for the D&aacute;il to become a quasi-Supreme Court.<\/p> <p> When I heard the various arguments, none convinced me that the institutions we have set up cannot be trusted or that we could not possibly have anything that is in any way influenced by the statutory organisations we have put in place to try to provide such protection.  I despair of the sentiment that we do not trust our own system.  When I hear the wholesale demeaning of the European Union regulations, I would say that I am critical of the European Union in that it has not been strong enough on fisheries protection over the past 40 to 50 years.  We sold out when we entered the Union.  We sold out our fishermen to benefit our farmers.  I would love to get a hell of a lot back.  I am glad that the sort of debate we should be having here took place in the Seanad earlier.  There is a real interest among Members of the Upper House in establishing the type of marine protected areas that would protect our natural world from all the international vessels fishing in our waters.  Most of the vessels fishing off our coast are from other jurisdictions.  We would protect our fisheries stocks for the future if we went the route to which I refer.  I wish we would look at that as an urgent issue for debate in the D&aacute;il.  We cannot blithely ignore the European Union regulations.  I accept the Minister of State's argument that we will lose &euro;37 million.  If we sign up to the motion, we will throw away money with the fines.  There are also other significant implications for us.<\/p> <p> We also need to stop being the country that is top of the league in terms of environmental infringement.  At some point, that will cost us.  The rest of Europe will catch up with this country and say that we can no longer play fast and loose with environmental regulations, which is what we are proposing to do.  I support the Government in this approach, not because it is a great champion of the environment but because we have to hold the line on this issue and stand up for putting in place a penalty points system, not weakening, debasing and undermining the Common Fisheries Policy.  We should then seek, from a position of strength, to go further and set up marine protected areas in which fishing stocks would be protected and move away from the system whereby a small number of very large vessels seem to dominate Irish industry interests and are able to obtain a huge chunk of the quota.  I would much prefer to see a more labour-intensive system where we support smaller inshore fleets and more sensitive, sustainable fishery methods.  There are a whole range of things we need to do on this.  The recently introduced proposal on the restriction of the number of large vessels operating within the 6-mile limit, stopping the catching of sprat - the feedstock for larger fish - starting a move towards the creation of significant marine protected areas, accepting the wisdom of E.O. Wilson, the great biologist, to the effect that we should set aside half of our natural world for conservation, because it is in dire trouble.  In that context, the extinction of species, particularly in our marine environment, is a real threat we have to address.  That is what we should be debating, not looking for further delay, prevarication, excuses and avoiding taking responsibility for looking after our fishing stocks and, by dint of that, our fishing industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300035#NN00400","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527087000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The fishing industry has enough on its decks in trying to compete and survive - not to mention the Brexit debacle centring around fishing grounds - without having to deal with what we describe as a flawed statutory instrument that will cause further worry and fear.  I have observed developments in this country over many years.  We seem to have an obsession with using the stick first rather than the carrot when it comes to EU regulations.  We all know how essential this industry is.  It gives employment to over 11,000 people, full-time and part-time, and, as Bord Bia has indicated, is responsible for &euro;645 million in seafood exports.<\/p>  <p>  This is the third attempt to introduce penalties, with a huge mount of time already spent in the courts.  In my view and in that of many others in Fianna F&aacute;il, that time could have been spent providing funding and finding common ground.  Deputy Gallagher has flagged this issue, and not just in recent times.  He has raised it at meetings of our parliamentary party and in fishing communities.  I commend him on his diligence in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine does not blame us for stalling.  If this discussion had taken place with the interested parties - I encourage him to find time to have that discussion with them - the issue could have been resolved quite quickly.

As previous speakers indicated, however, rules are about fairness and proportionality coupled with rights and entitlements.  They should be at the core of the penalty system.  We have a problem with the wording relating to the appeals process and, as Deputy Gallagher stated, we are seeking a workable solution.  All we request is that the statutory instrument be withdrawn and an amended version be brought forward to ensure that proper transparency and fairness will be there for all concerned.  As matters stand, the statutory instrument undermines the rights of fishermen and vessel owners in all of our coastal communities.

However, aside from and as well as this picturesque, ideal vision, it must be remembered that this industry was worth &euro;645 million in exports in 2017.  We all agree that regulations need to be in place and that infringements must be addressed.  Therefore, a penalty points system is necessary.  As my colleagues have already pointed out, however, such a system needs to be fair and respectful of fishermen's rights.  As matters stand, under this statutory instrument, the fisherman or licence holder will be guilty until proven innocent.  A burden of proof based on the balance of probabilities is totally inadequate.  How can a system such as this be conclusive?<\/p>  <p>  The proposed penalty points system makes no sense.  Logic would suggest that points would arrive on the basis of a haul in its entirety.  However, here we have a system whereby if a haul was to be sold in separate lots, penalty points would affix to each lot.  This is unfair in the extreme.  I know that many fishermen have expressed concern on the independence of the SFPA.  It appears that this is justified in some cases.  For example, I am advised that there were approximately 1,400 Spanish landings at Castletownbere and that the vessels involved were not exposed to a fraction of scrutiny that was levelled at Irish vessels making landings in the same harbour.  By all accounts, the difference is glaringly obvious.  Surely consistency is of paramount importance in order to be in compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy.  Aside from this, the statutory instrument provides that the SFPA will assign penalty points.  Then the authority will assign a three-person determination panel to assess whether an infringement has occurred.  This panel will decide whether an oral hearing may be conducted.  I cannot see any impartiality here.  If it exists, perhaps the Minister will point it out to me.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the appeals process, which also creates huge problems.<\/p><p>Ten days are allowed to request an oral hearing or to forward a written submission.  In general, an appeals process would allow a window of up to 30 days, and this is even more important in circumstances where fishermen are regularly at sea.

However, we must be fair to an industry that contributes significantly to our economy and the people who work extremely hard and in extremely dangerous conditions to make a living.  By and large, they are law-abiding and they have the interests of their industry and fishing stocks in their heart.<\/p>  <p>  As has been pointed out, this has been challenged twice before through the courts and it has failed.

As the Government representative I am challenged by a wall of different views and it is entirely inadequate to get across the complexity of the message involved at the heart of this in the very little time afforded to the Government in Private Members' time.  That is not any reflection on Deputy Gallagher, and I appreciate his long-standing concern on this issue.  We have had long-standing engagement on it.  What we are about to do and reflect upon is extraordinary and significant.  I will put it in financial terms.<\/p>  <p>  There is &euro;37 million of funding available to us under the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which is immediately in the firing line.  There is over &euro;200 million available in the MFF that supports the fishing industry in many ways, including processing, improved gear selection etc.  That could be further jeopardised.  We should also bear in mind that back in the early 2000s, the French were slapped with a fine for non-compliance with fishery regulations of &euro;50 million every six months.  We are about to embark on something that has enormous financial significance and the Government's opportunity to respond to this initiative amounts to two ten-minute slots in a debate.  This is the only opportunity available to Deputy Gallagher but now is an opportune time to reflect on the gravity of what we are considering.<\/p>  <p>  Another point being made loosely is what would happen if only the Government acted \"legally\".  I ask Members to think about that.  It has also been a criticism that we have been here since 2014 and there was a statutory instrument in 2016.  The point was made by Deputy Pearse Doherty but that statutory instrument stands approved by this House.  It is something we must reflect upon in the context of a vote that may take place next week.  The argument was made that this Government is being reckless in the context of the Supreme Court ruling.  It was right and proper that we waited on the High Court adjudication and the appeal to the Supreme Court before acting on a 2018 statutory instrument, and that is exactly what we did.  That ruling did not come until December 2017.  We have not hung around or prevaricated.  We moved appropriately after a Supreme Court adjudication, which made two very distinct and important findings.<\/p>  <p>  It indicated it is appropriate to proceed by way of administrative sanction through a statutory instrument.  For the first time, it was confirmation that we can have administrative sanctions by way of a statutory instrument.  On narrower grounds it found against the State and therefore the 2014 statutory instrument fell on the basis of the burden of proof.  The 2018 statutory instrument has totally responded to the High Court ruling and the burden of proof has been changed entirely.  Many Members have called it unfair, with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony saying somebody is guilty until proven innocent, but that is not the case.  Many Deputies who spoke have not read the statutory instrument in detail, and it has much detail addressing each and every finding in the Supreme Court ruling.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gallagher made a number of points, apart from his protestations that he is in favour of administrative sanctions, as he should be.  This regulation was negotiated and approved by a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.  It is prescriptive and there is no wriggle room.  It is what we are implementing by way of statutory instrument.  Deputy Gallagher indicated he is in favour of a points system but objected to the level of proof being \"balance of probability\".  The Supreme Court stated quite clearly that we can have an administrative sanction regime - a European points system - but the burden of proof for such administrative sanction is the balance of probability.  It is not \"beyond reasonable doubt\", which is the criminal sanction.  Deputy Gallagher must make up his mind as to whether he wants to abide by the Supreme Court ruling or a hybrid system unknown to anybody with on one hand a balance of probability and, if we do not like that, an option of beyond reasonable doubt.  The Supreme Court ruling in December 2017 clearly stated we can have a balance of probability administrative sanction regime.<\/p>  <p>  Access to courts is provided for on a point of law.  What else would one want access to the courts for other than on a point of law?<\/p><p>I very much take the point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I think his point was subsequent to that of Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, but Deputy Murphy O'Mahony again brought into question the integrity of a State agency.  Would we attack the Garda in this House like we feel free and willing to attack the SFPA and to impugn its integrity and its commitment to doing its job right and proper?  I do not think we would.  We certainly would not do so with the Garda and we should not do so with the SFPA.<\/p> <p> A point was made about the sale of vessels and how that is being dealt with in the statutory instrument.  I wish to quote from the EU regulation that was negotiated by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It states, \"The points assigned shall be transferred to any future holder of the fishing licence for the fishing vessel concerned where the vessel is sold, transferred or otherwise changes ownership after the date of the infringement.\"  The criticism in this regard of the statutory instrument appears to me to be that we did not leave a loophole such that one could shift the tonnage or in some way diminish the impact of the sanction of points because one could shift tonnage in a way that minimised the impact of the conviction.  The regulation is effective in this regard, and it is right that it should be so.  This has been spun, of course, as an attack on the whole fishing industry, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Who fears a points regime?  The fishing industry?  Only those who break the law fear such a regime.<\/p> <p> To take up the point Deputy Danny Healy-Rae made, this is not about minor fishing infringements; this is a regulation that is specifically designed for serious offences.  It is not about the generality of the fishing industry, which, by and large, is law-abiding.  However, those who commit serious offences deserve the full sanction of the law and I do not think anyone disputes that.  However, to judge from the contributions, one would think we want to create a fog and to have a system of administrative sanctions but administrative sanctions on a \"beyond reasonable doubt\" evidential standard.  That hybrid does not exist, Deputy Gallagher.  We need to be realistic and fair about what we are talking about.  If this were only about timelines and oral hearings, I am sure we could fix this very quickly.  However, there appear to be much more fundamental issues at stake here about whether we accept the findings of the Supreme Court.  That is, I think, what is at issue.  I slightly digress, but Deputy Calleary, as a legal person, must have smirked in some respect about the issues surrounding the Supreme Court ruling and the hybrid evidential standard being advanced.  However, he did talk about the inshore fishing industry, and we currently have under way a consultation for the inshore sector.  I look forward to the support of those who spoke very eloquently about the fishing industry and the inshore sector in the context of the recommendations that might come to me in due course about how we might best protect those in the inshore sector to ensure they can make a living in a challenged environment.<\/p> <p> I made the point earlier to Deputy Pearse Doherty about the 2016 statutory instrument.  We had the 2014 statutory instrument.  That was the subject of a High Court and, most recently, a Supreme Court ruling.  The 2016 statutory instrument, which Deputy Pearse Doherty, for some reason, seems to think he voted down, was not voted down.  It stands approved by the House, and we will have to reflect on that.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, the process for dealing with something as significant as this is inadequate.  This is the first time the House has sought to annul a statutory instrument, and we should not do that without reflecting quite seriously on the consequences.  The consequences are very significant in terms of the financial cost to taxpayers.  We are not talking about small change here; we are talking about many millions of euro of taxpayers' money, money that is invested to protect the best interests of the fishing industry.  I stand by the fishing industry.  It is my job to stand by the fishing industry and I am proud to do so and to make efforts to build an industry that can achieve its potential.  It is interesting to hear the contributions concerning our entry into the European Union and how it might have been sold out etc.  Our industry today is multiples the size it was when we joined the European Union.  Our industry then was by and large an inshore industry.  We now have a fine fishing industry and we look for the maximum possible sustainable opportunities for that industry.  Key to this is having an effective sanctions regime for those who put the livelihoods of the majority in jeopardy by unsustainable fishing practices.  That is in essence what is at the heart of this matter.  It is about penalising the few who are serious lawbreakers.  This is not for minor offences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300037#PP00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527088200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank my party colleague and spokesperson on the marine and fisheries, Deputy Gallagher, for bringing forward this important motion.  The reason for the motion is that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has laid before the House a statutory instrument known as the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2018.  This statutory instrument allows penalty points to be applied to fishing vessel owners who ostensibly carry out illegal and unregulated fishing.  My party is not opposed to the introduction of a penalty points system for serious infringements of the EU Common Fisheries Policy.  However, any sanctions to discourage this activity need to have fairness, justice and equality for fisherman across the country at the core of such a system.  However, sadly, it would appear that the Government's statutory instrument, as introduced in March 2018, does not display these qualities.  Previous attempts by statutory instrument to resolve this issue have been found to be unconstitutional and this statutory instrument and the appeals process involved once again appear to be problematic.  There are very real concerns that there has not been appropriate and fair consultation with those directly affected.  As I said, this is now apparently the third time to resolve this issue.  Two previous attempts were struck down and there have been comments about money being spent.  However, the State must have incurred significant costs in the courts system in respect of these statutory instruments.  As I said, I very much welcome Deputy Gallagher's bringing forward of this motion because it is crucial.  In the recent Storm Ophelia, fishermen in Wexford faced significant damage and suffered significantly.  Fishermen are struggling across the country but in particular after the damage that was caused by that storm.  While we see compensation and support for farmers regularly, and that is welcome, I am at a loss to understand why fishermen cannot be supported in a similar manner.  The programme for Government sets out very clearly that the blue economy is a key industry.  However, we are not seeing, in my view, the necessary supports put in place to support the blue economy and the fishermen, in particular small fishermen who are very much struggling and will continue to struggle for some time because of this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I return to the statutory instrument at hand.  Significant concerns are being raised in this House about this statutory instrument, in particular its fairness and a resolution of this issue must be found.  Fishermen who are fishing illegally, who are not reporting their catches, need to be dealt with and taken in hand.  However, this needs to be done in a fair, workable and balanced manner in order that ordinary decent fishermen are not caught up in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300038#QQ00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1527088200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank all who have contributed to the debate.  As a Donegal Deputy, I am extremely pleased and proud that four of the five Donegal Deputies have come in here and contributed to the debate, namely, myself and my colleagues, Deputies McConalogue, Pearse Doherty and Pringle.  I thank them for their support.<\/p>  <p>  We would get the impression from listening to the Minister that this is all about money and that it is money that is so important.  Let me remind the House of something.  I have said it in the European Parliament, where I was a member of the fisheries committee for 14 years, working very well with various Ministers while I was there.  I have worked there, I have said it there and I will repeat it here: the sector that has paid too great a price for membership of the European Union is the fishing sector, sharing our prolific grounds with all the European countries.<\/p><p>That cake was divided.  The key issue now remains as it was then.  The only increase we ever had was in boarfish.  I single handedly ensured that.  There might not be an abundance of boarfish now but when they do return, we have the highest percentage, at almost 80%.  I did that on my own and did not have the support of the Government of the time.<\/p> <p> I refer to a point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  Whoever was briefing the Deputy in the early noughties is still doing so today.  He is making allegations that the industry does not respect the rules and regulations.  I have never seen the industry more regulated and more compliant than it is now and I am sure the Minster would be the first to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p> The Minister asked \"What about the points?\"  He is correct.  They are not with the boat, but they are with the capacity and the Minister has acknowledged that in correspondence with me.  It is all right to say that it is there when it suits and it is not there, but it is there.  I do not have the time to go through the Supreme Court decision but in the coming days I will circulate to the Minister the amendments which I believe can be accepted by the Government and this House.  We will not procrastinate.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, said that the reason for supporting this statutory instrument is because we are jeopardising &euro;40 million in European funding.  Is that a good enough reason?  Are we prepared to sell the industry out once again, as it was sold out in the past?  It is a pact.  The Minister has said himself that it is not a good enough reason.  It is ironic that last Thursday or Friday the Government decided it would ask for extra time.  This is nothing short of blackmail.  Whatever number of millions is in question, it pales into insignificance with the amount of millions of euro that have been lost by the sector.<\/p> <p> I have always said that the engine of economic growth in the country is the private sector.  It provides jobs in the most rural, peripheral regions where there is no alternative source of development.  It is not the Government that provides jobs in those areas, but the fishing sector.  The Government does not rural-proof its policies, as those of us who come from the peripheral areas of Europe know. <\/p> <p> I am sorry that Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has returned, was not here earlier when I observed that the fishermen are the most compliant fishermen in Europe.  Whoever is briefing him about letters to the Commission in 2004 should know that things have changed since then.  We do not have time to discuss this today, but he is a good friend and I can explain it to him one-to-one another time.<\/p> <p> The Minister made comparisons with the garda&iacute; which I think was wrong.  The proposed structure would be similar to the garda&iacute; in detecting an infringement, later selecting the judges to adjudicate in the case, and that does not make sense. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300038#QQ00300","speaker":"1289","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527088800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300039#RR00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1527088800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The Minister should read the statutory instrument.

He needs to identify a path for the Government and Oireachtas showing how we will reach a satisfactory resolution in respect of this matter.  We need the Government to act with collective responsibility, as opposed to individual responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300040#SS01400","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527090000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I am as confused as the rest of the Members.  The optics of what has happened are certainly not good.  Many amendments have been ruled out.  I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's position.  We adjourned last night in disarray and he had to try to sort this out.  I am not questioning his decision at all.  He has informed us that several amendments, or up to 30, as far as I could make out, may not be moved.  Certainly, the number is in the high 20s.  The Ceann Comhairle mentioned that the matter might be dealt with in the Seanad, after which the Bill will return here.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, cut his teeth in the Seanad.  I wonder where he is.  He is not here tonight again.  We all know this is his Bill and that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is shepherding it thorough like a substitute driver.  When the tachograph period runs out, one has to get a different driver to drive the vehicle.  One cannot stay driving after a certain number of hours.  I do not believe there any laws in this regard when speaking in here.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport could well be here to let us know why he got us into this sorry mess.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan and others referred to the dog's dinner.  I do not believe any dog would even eat the dinner as it now has such a vile taste.  While the Minister might have had good motives when he started out, the Bill has just gone all over the place.  It is off the tracks and is totally unwieldy.  I mean no disrespect to my learned colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, in saying the Minister's ambition might have been to rein in the King's Inns.  That was probably his initial attack but, like a blunderbuss, he has widened it to many areas.<\/p>  <p>  We all know the Minister has been and is holding up the appointment of judges.  That was quite public.  A number of judges have been appointed in spite of the Minister.  To think that he might be holding up appointments considering the backlog of cases in our courts at all levels, from the High Court to the new Court of Appeal, is of concern.  Cases are being fast-tracked in many cases, which is very strange.  I am not a lawyer or legal expert but I know that while justice delayed is justice denied, justice rushed could also be justice denied.  Hundreds of cases were held in a couple of weeks.  This could be justice denied.  I am quite alarmed.  As I stated, we are in uncharted waters or unfamiliar territory.  Should the Cabinet not withdraw this Bill and reintroduce it in a proper, structured manner that we would know about?<\/p>  <p>  On the holding up of the appointment of judges, the Minister, Deputy Ross, is the same Minister who accused us of delaying the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill when we were representing our constituents.  We were saying it was a mess of a Bill and not fit for purpose.  That is all we were doing.  We were trying to represent our constituents and point out obvious flaws in the Bill.  It may be dealt with here tonight if the Bill under consideration is finished.  These are two Bills that the Minister, because of his ego, is desperate to pass in the Houses in some form before he leaves office.  This will be his monument.  It is some monument and some legacy to leave this kind of mess. <\/p>  <p>  So many amendments have been ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle because of what happened last night with amendments Nos. 6 and 10.  While I had a number of points to add on this, I am just so all over the place now that I do not know whether we are coming or going.  As I said, one Cabinet Minister should not be allowed to cause this kind of trauma and stress here.  Deals were done with various parties to get this Bill over the line any which way, as the former Ceann Comhairle said last night.  It is a desperate attempt to keep it alive, get it over the line, and get it into law and out to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300041#TT00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1527090000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but a number of other speakers want to contribute.

Arising from that confusion, I will not say there is no clarity but that there is no great clarity on the process from here on.  Looking at the very serious content and intent of this Bill, I believe it would be worthwhile giving consideration to withdrawing it and reintroducing it when fully thought out and when it deals with the issues that have arisen in the context of the debate on it up to now.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Part of the purpose of the Bill is to reform the way judges are appointed but there is no other offer of reform in the Bill.  Legislation is more often questioned and challenged outside this House now and in that challenge, commentators reflect on the course of the debate in the House.  This is a Bill that should not have any question mark over its passage.  There should be no question mark whatsoever allowing legal eagles outside the House to pick holes in the Bill's content and in how it was dealt with and passed in here.  It would serve us far better as legislators to concentrate on the complete withdrawal of this Bill and its reintroduction to the House when it is appropriately dealt with.<\/font><\/p><p>It reminds me of the case I mentioned last night and the outfall of it in terms of the imprisonment of a woman, Yvonne Walsh, in Mountjoy Prison.

Her two 15 year old children are doing the junior certificate.  She is a lady who wants to comply with the courts.  What has been set out for judges, and what has been set out in that case, is an example of very poor administration of justice.  I was with her for an hour and a half, and I have to say this debate now is similar to the one she is encountering.  The onus is on us to get it right.  I appeal to the Minister to have some sense in regard to this, disregard the agenda of the Minister, Deputy Ross, focus on the intent of the Bill, be far more reforming in terms of its content and come back into the House and allow us have a proper debate on it.

It is not of the Minister's making but, sadly, the finger will be pointed at him and as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, he can be damn sure the Minister, Deputy Ross, will be writing about him in a very short period of time.  This mess is in the hands of the Minister, Deputy Ross, and he is not here to explain himself.  He is hiding.  This is an astonishing situation.  To be honest, it is embarrassing and confusing in light of the fact that the Bill now has to go back to the Seanad.  When we first debated this Bill a number of months ago, a vote was called.  It was a Thursday.  I remember that I voted a certain way and rushed back to a committee I am involved in, the Schull show committee.  I got a text from the Minister, Deputy Ross, that night.  I have no problem getting a text from the Minister.  I am delighted to get a text from a Minister and I am easily able to text back.  He was surprised at me that I voted in a certain direction and I told him that the Bill was confusing.  I told him at that time that it was going in a direction that does not make any sense.  I am only a young gars&uacute;n inside here in the D&aacute;il, and most people might say with very little understanding, but I knew at that time we were going in a certain direction that did not make any sense to me, as naive as I thought I was.  However, it turns out that I was 100% correct in my assertion at the time.<\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister to withdraw the Bill and throw it in the bin.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is the cause of what is nothing short of filibustering.  He is using delaying tactics that are costing the State money and costing public representatives their time and energy in this House.  He should come in here, explain his carry-on and the errors he has committed regarding this Bill.  I ask the Minister please to give serious consideration to binning the Bill and let us get back to putting it right.  He should talk to the Minister, Deputy Ross, and get him to bin other Bills also that are the cause of hardship and misery in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300042#UU03100","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1527090600,"counter":426,"content":"<p>There is obviously a degree of urgency to enact legislation around the area of judicial appointments.

While the Ceann Comhairle has said, and the Minister has agreed, that we can refer the Bill to the Seanad, amend it and revert to this House, the real concern is that if the Bill is subsequently challenged and the debate is referred to in terms of the intent of the D&aacute;il, it then becomes very unclear because on the one hand we voted that there would be 13 members on the commission but on the other hand we added three additional members, being the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court and the Attorney General.  When that debate arises, the question will be whether it is 13 members and who the three additional people are replacing.<\/p><p>It has added serious confusion.  The Minister knows as well as I that when a Bill is challenged in this way, it is frequently the case that the transcripts of the debate in the D&aacute;il are needed in order to understand what Members were trying to deal with.  I agree with Deputy McGuinness that the correct procedure would be to withdraw the Bill and start again properly.  It would add the level of clarity that is required.<\/p> <p> I asked the Minister about what will be the annual running cost of the commission, particularly when he said it was a 17-member commission.  I alluded to a figure of &euro;1 million and the Minister told me subsequently it was &euro;500,000.  I want to put on the record that this figure of &euro;1 million comes from the explanatory memorandum.  I do not want the Minister to think we are exaggerating the figure.  They are the figures the Minister presented to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300042#UU03200","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527091200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I notice the Minister's body language, never mind that of the Ceann Comhairle, which is quite bemused at the events that are taking place.

I agree with what my colleagues said.  There is an awful lot of confusion, particularly with regard to ministerial responsibilities.  I raised that issue last night.  I agree that the Minister should consider withdrawing the Bill and starting again.  The latest proposal that arose in the past few days involves using the opportunity of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill to bring in some changes relating to sentencing guidelines.  While I welcome the sentencing guidelines, just blending them with this Bill seems inappropriate.  People also took the opportunity during the debate to question the decisions of judges of particular courts without offering any particular evidence during that debate.  That is quite scandalous.  I was thinking about some of the statements that were made last night.  We may come back to that again.<\/p>  <p>  One issue I raised last night concerned the example of family courts, which are in camera.  I have received suggestions from constituents that some of the decisions and behaviours of judges raised the need for supervision of judges.  That is the kind of thing that could be included in the Bill.  What the public will be most lost about is the fact that even after we go through all of this process, the Government may discount all the suggestions and recommendations made by this new proposed quango and actually make its own decisions relating to the appointment of judges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300043#VV00600","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1527091200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>All of us would agree with what my colleagues have said.  This includes most of the parties in Opposition with the exception of Sinn F&eacute;in.  I think this is an aspect of this as well.  The Minister seems to be content with allowing a below-standard piece of legislation to be passed in a ham-fisted and amateurish way.  It damages the Department and the Minister.  The Minister is allowing the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - by means of the comments he made over the past number of months - to damage our Judiciary.  Can someone tell me which judges have been appointed incorrectly to courts in our country since Independence?  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has raised questions about appointments by saying that they were due to cronyism and political deals.  Which judges does he think should not be serving right now?  Which judges do Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and Sinn F&eacute;in think should not be serving right now?  That is the issue that is fundamental to what they want to do here in appointing a commission with a majority of lay people - of people who may very well have an axe to grind with certain members of the Judiciary.  I put it to them that probably many members of Sinn F&eacute;in may have an axe to grind with certain members of the Judiciary as well.<\/p>  <p>  What we are trying to do here is very serious.  For the first time since 1995, the Government is changing how judges are appointed.  I do not believe the system was broken and I do not think the Minister believes that either.  At the whim of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and in order to keep the Government going with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in, which did not actually recognise many of the courts 40 years ago let alone the Judiciary itself, the Minister is willing to take a hammer and change how appointments are made.  I really believe that the manner in which this debate has unfolded and also that in which these amendments have been dealt with mean that as part of a duty of care to ensure that legislation is robust, the Minister must withdraw the Bill and start again.  When the public looks in from the outside at how this has been dealt with by the Department, it raises further questions about the latter and about the operation of the Cabinet and how it is proceeding, with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in, to fundamentally change how judges are appointed.

It would be ludicrous to proceed on the basis that we accept that what we have done is flawed but we will continue with the process and expect the Seanad to clear up the mess in some kind of ham-fisted way.  This is really an appalling vista, if that is not too strong a phrase.  I have some sympathy for the Minister because I know the difficulties he has at Cabinet level and I know the issues he has with one member in particular and his band of merry warriors.  I served with him in the Seanad and I know his form.<\/p>  <p>  The thing that catches me out a bit is how this creates a problem for Sinn F&eacute;in because I am at a loss to understand how it is beholden to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It entered into an agreement with the Minister for Justice and Equality in good faith and I understand that.  I might not agree with it but I understand it.  However, when an event happens, as happened last night, surely Sinn F&eacute;in will not continue with this charade of allowing the Seanad to clear up the mess created by this House.  Surely Sinn F&eacute;in has more respect for its role as a key Opposition party and will not allow the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to engage in bullying because he is a member of the Cabinet.  Surely Sinn F&eacute;in will call him out on that and support the House in seeking the withdrawal of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in can support the contents and provisions of the Bill with which it has sought to agree.  Whatever grubby deal it has done in some other way, it will get all of that in due course.  It should, however, show some respect for the House for God's sake.  We spoke for a long time about ensuring that those of us outside of Government would have some level of input into the workings of this House.  The first opportunity Sinn F&eacute;in got, however, it has chosen to work hand in glove with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and bully the Minister opposite in order to drive ahead regardless of the mistakes that have been made.  It can still get its way but it should show respect for the House, its procedures and the way in which legislation is or should be properly formulated.  We should do the best we can do with it in this House.  Fair enough, if something arises at a later stage, all the other checks and balances that exist can be applied.

A large number of amendments sought to change the composition of the commission to increase the membership of the commission, while at the same time maintaining a lay majority.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth reminding Members as to what took place because there seems to be a difference of views here.  I sought, by way of Government amendment, to have the two lower court presidents, the President of the District Court and the President of the Circuit Court, as full members of the commission and to reinstate the Attorney General for the reasons I outlined, not only on this Stage, but also in some detail on Committee Stage.  My amendment No. 10 achieved that.  I sought to replace the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission with a nominee of that body who would be a layperson and my amendment No. 12 achieved that.<\/p>  <p>  I also sought to increase the number of laypersons by one from six to seven.  This was in the context of our debate where everyone was in agreement that we should have a broadly based commission.  However, my amendment No. 14 would have achieved that if passed.  I acknowledge now what the Ceann Comhairle has said.  I fully accept his ruling that the discrepancy or contradiction - it is no more than that - which arises from the defeat of my amendment No. 8 would have changed section 10 to provide for a commission of 17 in place of a commission of 13 and the subsequent passing of amendment No. 10 relating to the addition of three members.  Therefore, the effect of the defeat of amendment No. 8 and the passing of amendment No. 10 is what was agreed to in the House.  It is inconsistent, but it was voted upon.  I do not intend to withdraw the Bill because I believe we have a pathway forward, as outlined by the Ceann Comhairle at the commencement of this evening's debate.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that it is not ideal, but I acknowledge the will and wishes of Members of this House as manifest in the vote.  I listened with great detail to everyone's contributions and I now believe that the object of our exercise must be to move forward now with a view to addressing the inconsistency, and I believe we can do it.  I welcome the positive disposition of Members who agreed that should be our priority.  However, other Members have different views.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to respond to a number of serious questions raised here.  I welcome the contribution of Deputy Curran, a former Government Whip with some experience of the practice and procedure of the House.  He made a point about the operational and set-up costs.  He rightly referred to the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  However, he omitted to say that on Committee Stage we changed the architecture from how it appeared when the Bill was originally submitted.  At the behest of the committee - again by way of lawful democratic vote - we removed much of the architecture that was going to consume some of the projected cost.  The Department of Justice and Equality estimate it to be a little more than half of the amount to which Deputy Curran adverted.  It will be in the region of &euro;500,000 to &euro;600,000.  It is obviously very difficult to put an exact figure on it, but it is important for us to be familiar with the parameters.<\/p>  <p>  There is no veto on the appointment of judges, nor should there be, nor can there be as far as Government is concerned with particular reference to the constitutional role and function of Government in this regard.<\/p><p>I might add, for the information of Members, that there is no change to the constitutional position on the appointment of judges.  This advisory commission will recommend a number of names to Government but the constitutional and legal position will not change in regard to the obligation, power and authority on the part of Government to nominate, for appointment by the President, members of the Judiciary.  There is no veto and there is no freezing, which is evidenced by a number of recent appointments that were well received in this House.  I acknowledge the positive contribution of Members in that regard.<\/p> <p> I agree with much of what Deputy Darragh O'Brien said.  I do not agree with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in many of the comments he has made.  I put that on the record last week when he was sitting beside me, lest there be any misunderstanding or misinterpretation of my comments.  We agree to differ.  We are members of different parties.  We are together in a partnership arrangement and we have agreed a programme for Government.  While I very much respect the entitlement of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to hold an opinion, I do not agree with that opinion and I do not share his view.  I acknowledge, of course, that this reforming legislation is in the programme for Government and, of course, the priority of any Government is to proceed with the implementation of its programme.<\/p> <p> This is a Bill produced by the Department of Justice and Equality in accordance with the commitment given in the programme for Government.  While I am pleased that we have made some progress, I am disappointed that we have not made the type of progress I and many other Members would have wished.  However, I do not see the need for any rush.  In fact, anyone who read the Committee State proceedings would be of the view that there are not too many items of legislation enacted here in the past couple of years that have been given such detailed consideration.  That is testament to the authority of the justice committee, which I welcome.  I am a democrat.  I also welcome the fact we are operating in a minority Government situation.<\/p> <p> This is important, reforming legislation.  I urge Members to continue to work on it with a view towards improving it.  Of course, I acknowledge that there is now an inconsistency but that inconsistency was a result of a democratic vote in the House last night.  I voted in a particular way but a majority of Members in the House did not agree with that and, of course, I accept that.  I agree with the Ceann Comhairle when he says there are now a considerable number of amendments that he feels should not, in the circumstances, be put.  I believe that to be the correct course of action because the amendments that will not be put are the amendments deemed out of order.  All of that is as a direct consequence of the actions we took last night.<\/p> <p> In the normal course of events, that would occur in any event.  However, the difficulty arises due to the fact we are left with an inconsistency.  I believe there is a way in which that can be dealt with.  I acknowledge what has been said in that regard by Deputies O'Callaghan and &Oacute; Laoghaire, both of whom have been involved in the detail of this legislation since its publication.  I am of the view that we can move forward on the matter of these amendments.  Of course, I will accept the democratic wishes of the House as far as the endorsement, or otherwise, of these amendments is concerned, and we will then proceed to the Seanad.  However, this will not be done in any rush or with any undue haste, but only having given the matter careful and due consideration.  That is my obligation.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have an obligation to ensure there is a duty of care, to quote Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I take that role and function seriously.  My duty of care is to enact a piece of legislation that is legally sound, constitutionally robust and workable, and I think we can do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300044#WW02500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527092400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I welcome the comments from the colleagues behind me and from Deputy Eamon Ryan in respect of the issues they raised.

I understand the Minister has rejected that but perhaps he should reconsider it.  The second option is that we go down the route outlined at the outset by the Ceann Comhairle.  The third option is one we have not yet considered.  It was the case that, yesterday, one of the amendments put forward by Deputy Wallace, amendment No. 7a, was tabled as a late amendment.  Is it not possible that we could rise now and come back at a later time, when the Minister could bring froward further amendments which we would consider at that later stage?  I ask the Minister to consider this.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge the point the Minister made when he indicated the cost of the commission will not be &euro;1 million, as identified in the explanatory memorandum, but will be reduced to &euro;500,000 <i>per annum<\/i>.  I want to commend the justice committee because, as a result of its work, according to the Minster, it has managed to reduce the running costs of this quango by 50% through its amendments.  That needs to be recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300045#XX00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1527092400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I, too, have listened to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I understand the predicament he is in and I thank him for his clarifications, especially those on why the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport cannot be here and on how he disagrees with his colleague.  That is healthy in any democracy.  Nonetheless, I am still very concerned.  We are in uncharted waters and there are too many anomalies.  While I do not want to disrespect the Ceann Comhairle in any way in regard to what he suggested, I believe the most honourable and respectful course of action for the Minister and the Government would be to withdraw the Bill at this time.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, there are three options.  The second is to do as the Ceann Comhairle said and the third is to do what we did with Deputy Mick Wallace's amendment No. 7a last night.  It is very strange territory, particularly given the genesis of the Bill.  I also acknowledge the work done by the justice committee in regard to amendments.  The spectacle here last night was totally unsavoury and while I am not blaming anyone for that, there was utter confusion.  Although the Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible for marching the Bill through the Houses, the Minister who designed it, and who has got his paw marks and fingerprints all over it, is as l&aacute;thair - absent.  I am sure he is up in his office watching this in order to know what we are saying about it, but he is now like an absentee landlord from the hills of Killiney.

What was put out there, with absolute fanfare, as the supposedly greatest radical reform in appointments to the Judiciary in the history of the State has turned out to be an absolute and utter debacle in terms of what went on here last night.  It actually copper-fastens political influence in the process and makes for more political interference than existed previously.  While the Minister said that what we are doing here is legally sound and workable, I do not think he can say that because we are buying a pig in a poke.<\/p><p>In fact, such was the mess last night, we do not know what we are buying here.  We know that side deals are being done and people are being brought on side with various commitments but that makes a nonsense of what is one of our most important areas of work, because the role of the Judiciary is absolutely critical.<\/p> <p> While I do not think the amendments were perfect, nor do I think they were dreadful but the scenario we have got ourselves into is worse now.  It would be best all round to withdraw the Bill because people have been contradicting themselves.  Last night, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the Labour Party voted to reduce the numbers and then voted to put three extra people on.  It is absolute lunacy.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members were doing side deals.  They said on the record that they would vote for the position outlined in Deputy Wallace's amendment, in which the presidents of the District and Circuit Courts would be put back in, but that they did not want the Attorney General in and wanted a lay majority.  Although this was provided for in Deputy Wallace's amendment, they did not support it because they had done a deal with the Government, presumably on sentencing, which will not be really enforceable anyway.<\/p> <p> The Minister says this was not rushed and that we are not being hasty with amendments being brought back here.  This time last year, the Minister's predecessor sat down with the heads of the Department of Justice and Equality and committed that the number one item of priority legislation was on mandatory inquests in respect of maternal deaths, in the form of the proposed coroners (amendment) Bill.  We discussed the timescale and the possibilities for its enactment by last summer, not this summer.  I raised it with the Minister and raised it with the Taoiseach in February, who told me it would be published that month.  The Minister told me in March it would be published later that month but there has been nothing.  Where is the rush there?   This is a nonsense, particularly when one sees the Judicial Council Bill languishing in the Seanad.  That is an opportunity for real reform but we get this nonsense.

While that is something on which the Ceann Comhairle can adjudicate when he has a minute, I do not think they can be pushed at the moment.  I am not sure if they can be tabled now although we would be happy if they could.<\/p><p>I am sorry that Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 24, which is also consequential on his amendment No. 6, cannot be moved now either.  This is key because that was to get rid of the Public Appointments Service as the body to appoint lay members and he was proposing that it be replaced with a system whereby lay members would be nominated by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Free Legal Advice Centres, the Citizens Information Board and so on.  We had something similar on Committee Stage.  While that cannot be moved, the discussion and the problems with the Public Appointments Service have to be re-echoed.  It is not ideal.  It is unsatisfactory that the PAS has been given the role of appointing the lay members.  There is huge potential for that in indirectly rechannelling ministerial influence through the PAS.  It is also the case, and the point was well made on Committee Stage, that the type of expertise that was being sought for commission members came from the commerce, business or senior civil servant type of background, which could be far more susceptible to political influence and far more connected to the political classes, than any members of the Judiciary in many instances.  What we would get would really be an optical replacement of, mar dhea, lay people but which would be just as susceptible to political influence as any other body.  In that sense, it is really regrettable that those amendments cannot be tabled.<\/p><p>I refer to Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 29.  It seeks to change the criteria by which PAS selects lay members.  It is broadly similar to what is in the Bill already, with the key difference that it proposes a diversity and social inclusion appointment category.  It is more complicated to involve the PAS.  I note a technical problem with it, in that it is called &quot;the public appointments commission&quot;.  I do not know if that will be a problem with it going further but the PAS is being maintained with a list of nominating bodies called the diversity and inclusion panel.  Those bodies would nominate three of the lay members of the commission.  The bodies on the panel would have to demonstrate their relevance to the objectives of diversity outlined in amendment No. 3 or on the nine grounds in the Employment Equality Acts.  It is a very novel and good idea, even though it is a little complicated.  I am willing to forfeit its complexity in deference to the important contribution it could potentially make towards encouraging and expanding diversity.  In light of some earlier amendments that were not moved, it is important that this amendment would be moved and consequently, we will be supporting that Sinn F&eacute;in amendment No. 29.<\/p><p>Although it is complex, it would, as I said, add to the Bill.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 38 is quite important as well.  We will certainly be pushing it, particularly if Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 29 does not pass.  We are proposing to delete the provision that lay members of the commission would have knowledge or experience of processes and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sectors organisations.  In other words, it is a kind of automatic pass on to the commission for retired senior civil servants.  It is not what the intent behind the legislation was when we spoke of appointing lay people; we were talking about people who reflect the most diverse aspects of Irish society.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 40 is in this group and it is still in order.  It is our tidying-up measure relating to an amendment we successfully tabled on Committee Stage providing that one of the areas of knowledge or experience that commission members should have is of \"civil society, trade union activity and academia\".  Our tidying amendment would change this to \"or academia\" as our original amendment could have had the consequence that one of the criteria for the appointment of lay members is to have knowledge in all three areas, which was not envisaged.  This amendment makes it clear it would be one or the other.<\/p> <p> Government amendment No. 41 reinserts \"board membership and corporate governance\" as one of the skills the lay members must possess.  We got rid of this on Committee Stage and it is incredibly insulting to committee members that the Minister would try to reintroduce this now.  There were incredibly strong arguments made as to why this should not be the case if we are to reflect a more diverse and real sort of background.  It is regrettable that the Minister is sneaking it back in here.  We will strongly oppose that.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 42 is a Government tidying-up measure in respect of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  As we have already voted to accept a member in other parts of the Bill, the amendment is absolutely fine.<\/p> <p> The other amendments in this group are out of order.  I believe they were all tabled by Deputies O'Callaghan and Wallace and myself, although I am not completely sure.  We had much discussion on Committee Stage on this and we feel strongly that there must be a check on the role of the Public Appointments Service in appointing lay people.  Either our amendment No. 38 or, preferably, Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 29 should be part of that, although only if linked with the rejection of amendment No. 41.  That amendment is trying to prescribe the type of lay person we are to get, which if the amendment is accepted will not be diverse at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052300050#CCC01200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527095700,"counter":534,"content":"<p>We are debating a series of amendments proposing to amend section 12, which deals with the recommendation of lay persons for appointment as members of the commission or as chairperson of the commission.  It is important to say at the outset that currently we do not know how many people we are talking about.  Under the amendment passed by the House last night, there are to be 13 members of the commission.  We know that five will be judges and three others will be lawyers, so I assume we are talking about having five laypersons.  However, one of the downsides of the Government running with the legislation in the way it has is that we know it will try to increase the number when the Bill gets to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We really do not know how many members will serve on the commission.  We know the Government wants a commission of 17 people but if there are to be eight from the Judiciary or legal profession, the Government will need to appoint nine lay people on to this commission.  It is important to point out these people cannot be members of the legal profession or retired judges, for example.  One would think it would be useful to have a retired judge on a commission to advise on the appointment of judges.  It could be somebody such as Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, who would be an excellent choice for the commission, or Ms Justice Mary Laffoy.  They are not allowed on it because they have been \"contaminated\", as the Government sees it, by previously being a member of the Judiciary.  It is easy for us in the House to try to put together legislation that will put lay people on this commission but we must understand and assess whether the section drafted and proposed by the Government would be feasible in terms of attracting individuals as lay members of this commission.<\/p>  <p>  We are dealing with a batch of 20 amendments, from amendment No. 25 to amendment No. 44, inclusive.  Like Deputy Clare Daly, I would like clarity on her amendments Nos. 25 and 26.  It is unlikely that they can be moved.  However, I am conscious that the Ceann Comhairle gave a very detailed written ruling to the House when Report Stage resumed.  Much consideration has gone into it and there is no indication that amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are not appropriate to be moved.  If they are not on his list, I suspect we will have to move them.  I will be supporting amendments Nos. 25 and 26.<\/p>  <p>  We know that amendments Nos. 27 and 28 have been ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 28 has the objective of having the members of the commission electing their own chairperson.  This was contained in my amendment No. 6, which was defeated by the House, and it is a very good idea that the commission should be able to elect its own chairperson.  How will we distinguish as to who will be the appropriate lay person to be nominated by the Public Appointments Service as the chairperson?  I do not know how those different characteristics will be assessed to determine a chairperson.  It is worth pointing out that in the North there is an equivalent body that makes recommendations to government on the appointment of judges in Northern Ireland.  The chairperson of that body is a judge.  For the past 23 years, the chairperson of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has been the Chief Justice.  For some reason a decision was made by the Government that it had to have what it referred to as a lay chairman; in effect, they want somebody who is not a judge or lawyer to be the chairperson.<\/p>  <p>  I have never got an answer to the question of what is the public policy benefit in having a person who is not a member of the Judiciary or a lawyer - it should be a member of the Judiciary instead of a lawyer - as the chairperson.  I do not believe in deference to any group in society but if the Taoiseach was asked to serve on a committee but he would not be allowed to chair it, there would be outrage.  That would arise because the Taoiseach is the head of the Executive branch and it would be inappropriate for him to be on a committee but not chair it.  Similarly, if this House set up a committee to deal with procedures in the House and the Ceann Comhairle was a member, he would end up as chairman.  I do not know if there is a committee in this House of which the Ceann Comhairle could not be the chairman.  I do not know why the Government insists that the Chief Justice, who will be on the commission, should not chair it.<\/p>  <p>  This seems again to be an obsession of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the effect that the commission cannot be chaired by a judge.  It is the wrong decision.  The person on the board with most insight into what it takes to be a judge would be a judge.  There is nothing controversial about that.  I mentioned last night that if a panel was to interview people to pick the next editor of a national newspaper, surely we would want people chairing the panel who would understand newspapers and what it is to be an effective editor of a newspaper.  For some reason, it is presented in this debate as though the last thing we should have is the Chief Justice chairing this commission.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 29 is from Sinn F&eacute;in and I do not know if it is being pursued.  I do not want to put Deputy &Oacute; Laoghhaire on the spot.  I am conscious that it refers to general lay appointments and the diversity and social inclusion appointments.
