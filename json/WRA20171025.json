Since its first call for proposals the Council has been working with consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. To date eleven new apprenticeships have been developed by the Council in various occupations such as accounting, finance and engineering. A number of these new programmes lead to an award on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) at degree level (levels 7 &amp;amp; 8) such as Insurance Practice (level 8), Electrical Engineering (level 7), Polymer Processing Technology (Level 7), Manufacturing Engineering (Level 7) and International Financial Services Specialist (level 8). Other programmes, arising from the first call, are at various stages of development and are expected to get underway later this year and during 2018, many of which lead to an award at level 7 and above on the NFQ. <\/p><p>Earlier this year we published the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 which sets out a series of detailed actions and annual targets on how we will achieve the expansion commitments in the area set out in the Action Plan for Education.A key commitment for this year set out in the Plan was the issuing of a second call for apprenticeship proposals to refresh the pipeline of proposals already established through the first call. The second call closed on the 1<sup>st<\/sup>September with 77 proposals received across arrange of sectors and occupations and at various levels on the NFQ.\u00a0 The Apprenticeship Council is currently assessing proposals received and will\u00a0make its\u00a0recommendations\u00a0to me in November. \u00a0I am confident that, as was the case with the first call, there will be a good spread of proposals recommended for development across all levels of the NFQ. <\/p><p>As set out in our Plan we have targeted a further ten new schemes for 2018 which will bring the total\u00a0new apprenticeships to 25, almost doubling the number of apprenticeship schemes on offer in Ireland.\u00a0 As the apprenticeship model is employer led, it\u00a0is difficult to quantify, at this stage, how many places will be taken up in the ten new\u00a0schemes scheduled for next year. However,\u00a0the Action\u00a0Plan targets 1,500 new registrations for 2018 across all of the new apprenticeships developed to date and introduced during the year.<\/p><p>Advanced Certificate Craft - Certs Issued by QQI 2014-2016 &amp;amp;

The definitive system will bring to an end the current transitional VAT system that has applied since the early 1990s.  It deals with changing the method of taxing intra-EU business-to-business supplies of goods from taxation based in the Member State of the supplier to the Member State of the consumer &ndash; i.e. the destination principle.   This complements the Modernisation of VAT on e-Commerce proposals, which focus on changing the method of charging VAT on business-to-consumer cross border supplies.  This is the subject of ongoing discussion at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In the early 1990s, the goal was to charge VAT on goods in the place of origin but the political and technical conditions were not suited to such a system.  Since 2011 the EU has been focusing on changing the method of taxation of cross-border EU trade so that VAT is charged on the basis of destination and not origin.  The Commission published a VAT Action Plan in 2016 that set a path towards the modernisation of VAT in this context, and the proposals published on 4 October are part of this Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The definitive VAT System proposals make core changes to the EU VAT Directive to introduce a definitive system based on the destination principle.  Further proposals will be published in 2018 dealing with technical details around this change.  I would point out that the ethos behind the change to the destination based VAT system is to modernise VAT for the digital economy and to simplify VAT for both businesses and tax authorities, as well as minimising VAT administration costs for businesses selling across a number of EU Member States.<\/p>  <p>  None of these proposals deal with the export of goods and services outside the EU and will have no impact on Irish businesses exporting outside the EU.  On the contrary the Modernisation of VAT on e-Commerce proposals, currently subject to discussions at EU level, aim to address the imbalance where goods are imported into the EU free of VAT.  The recently published definitive VAT regime proposals will be subject to discussion and negotiation at EU level in the near future. Changes to the EU VAT Directive can only be made on the basis of unanimity and Ireland will scrutinise all proposals to ensure that there are no unintended consequences for Irish exporters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE03500"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[45111\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason pensioners who were formerly civil servants, garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces are excluded from NHR tax exemption in Portugal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to his similar question of 5th October 2017 (No.42270\/17), I am advised by Revenue that it is not their practice to comment on the application of the provisions of the national law of other countries. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that if the Deputy supplies identifying detail in respect of the person and specifies the source of income concerned, or the individual contacts Revenue with details of his circumstances and the income concerned, Revenue will advise in relation to the application of the Ireland-Portugal Double Taxation Convention to that income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget Contribution","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE03800"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[45136\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 126 of 17 October 2017, the precise formula used in the calculation of the contribution to the EU budget; and if the nominal GDP growth rate for 2015, that is, 26% is factored into this.","asker":"1222","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>Further to the PQ of 17 October on the calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s EU budget contributions; Member State contributions to the EU Budget are calculated by the EU Commission in line with the provisions outlined in Own Resource Decision (ORD) Regulation (2014\/335) which was ratified by all Member States in 2016.

A comprehensive general anti-avoidance rule was introduced by the Oireachtas as far back as 1989. The Deputy may be aware there is a requirement in the recent EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for Member States to introduce a general anti-avoidance rule in their domestic law to take effect from 1 January 2019. This State has had a general anti-avoidance rule for nearly 30 years.<\/p><p>In order to assist Revenue in detecting avoidance schemes a mandatory disclosure scheme was introduced by the Finance Act 2010. The policy objectives underlying the introduction of the disclosure scheme were:<\/p><p>- to provide early information to Revenue about the schemes and how they purport to work,<\/p><p>- to provide information of the persons who availed of the scheme, and<\/p><p>- to afford Revenue an opportunity to recommend legislative change where it was considered necessary.<\/p><p>I have previously advised the Deputy of the number and the nature of the schemes disclosed to Revenue to date in my answer to PQ 39337\/17. In general, the primary responsibility for making a disclosure lies with the promoter of the scheme. Where a promoter proposes a transaction where a tax advantage is expected to accrue, the main benefit or one of the main benefits of the transaction is obtaining a tax advantage, and the transaction falls with a specified description then, that transaction must be disclosed. A comprehensive guidance note on the operation of the provision has been prepared by Revenue and is available for review on their website at <i>www.revenue.ie<\/i><\/p><p>In relation to the UK disclosure scheme I should advise the Deputy that, having regard to the broad similarities of the tax regimes in both jurisdictions, the mandatory disclosure scheme introduced by the Oireachtas in 2010 was closely aligned to the earlier Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes (DOTAS) adopted by the UK. A review of the mandatory disclosure regime was carried out by Revenue in 2014 and changes were made to the scheme in Finance Act  2014 and by subsequent regulations which provided further clarity and strengthened the provisions. <\/p><p>Revenue, at present, is not requesting any amendments to the mandatory disclosure regime and therefore I am not proposing any changes for the moment.  However, I am advised that the regime is kept under constant review by Revenue and developments in other jurisdictions are closely monitored. The promotion and use of egregious tax avoidance schemes is a modern day scourge and I will not hesitate to legislate to defeat such schemes which have at their heart an intention to frustrate the will of this House and the promotion of unfairness in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[45159\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the detail of the\u00a0&euro;233,896,324 million\u00a0of PAYE tax liability which is\u00a0under appeal\u00a0by quantum; the number of employees affected in increments of &euro;20,000 to &euro;240,000 and above &euro;240,000, in tabular form (details supplied).","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[45160\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of cases in actual dispute, technical dispute and avoidance structure regarding the\u00a0&euro;233,896,324 million\u00a0of PAYE tax liability which is currently\u00a0under appeal according to\u00a0the Revenue Commissioners in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the number of appeals relating to the almost &euro;234 million of PAYE tax liability is 244.

Share options can provide key employees with a financial incentive linked to the success of the company and may improve the attractiveness of an SME employment offer.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has requested a costing regarding a proposal to extend the KEEP relief to all SME business structures including limited companies, partnerships and sole trades; to extend the definition of share options to include tangible stock of a business, such as livestock; and to allow family member employees in farm enterprises to qualify for the relief.<\/p>  <p>  Farm enterprises which are SME companies as defined in the KEEP legislation may qualify for the relief, subject to meeting the other criteria. Businesses structured as partnerships and sole trades have significantly different legal forms than limited companies and would not have the ability to issue a 'share option' comparable to an option over the ordinary shares in a limited company. Similarly, tangible stock, such as livestock, is materially different to company shares. Therefore it is not possible to include partnerships or sole trades within the scope of the KEEP relief or to treat an option over livestock in a similar matter to an option over company shares, and as a result a potential cost for extending KEEP in such a manner cannot be estimated.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to family employees, there is an anti-avoidance provision in the KEEP legislation which provides that the relief cannot be claimed where the employee, together with any \"connected persons\", controls more than 15% of the ordinary share capital of the company.  The definition of connected person includes close family members, so in practice it is unlikely that the KEEP relief would be available to family members of the business owner (assuming he\/she holds more than 15% of the company), regardless of whether it is a farming or non-farming business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500082#WRE07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500083#WRF00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Sector High Level Forum","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500083#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[45151\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500083#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the work of the high level forum established to examine the issue of pensions for community employment supervisors;

These students have the option, where appropriate, of full\/partial integration and interaction with other students.<\/p><p>Other children may have such complex needs that the recommendation in their professional reports state that they are best placed in a special school.  <\/p><p>Decisions about placement should be based on individual needs and take into account a number of factors including parental wishes, availability of evidence-based treatments and well-trained staff and individual factors such as targets for intervention and management of behaviours.<\/p><p>There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for children with special educational needs, rather there is a model which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual students.<\/p><p>Students enrolling in Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: <\/p><p>- S\/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special class in question) and<\/p><p>- S\/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.<\/p><p>In relation to Autism Spectrum Disorder, almost 18,000 students in schools have been diagnosed with autism. My Department invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: <\/p><p>- 63% of students to attend  mainstream schools<\/p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and<\/p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.<\/p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs, including Autism, in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes as required.  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,302 for the 2017\/18 school year. 1,042 of these are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes of which 151 are newly established for this school year.<\/p><p>With regard to Co. Kildare in particular, there are 4 special schools and 66 special classes attached to mainstream schools. Of these, 6 are ASD early intervention classes, 41 are primary ASD classes and 12 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Kildare have increased from 17 in 2011\/2012 to 65 in 2017\/2018. <\/p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  <\/p><p>While it is not always possible to ensure that a special class placement will be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient special class placements to meet existing demand. <\/p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  <\/p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, are available on <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>in county order, with new classes identified. Information in relation to the number of available placements in each of these classes is not immediately available to my Department, I have forwarded your query to the NCSE for direct reply. <\/p><p>The NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local SENOs for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, as set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.<\/p><p>A total of 13,990 SNA posts are currently available for allocation to schools.  In addition to the 975 additional SNA posts announced in July for allocation to schools from September to December 2017, the recent Budget announcement provides for an additional 1,091 SNA posts for 2018.  This will bring the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2018, to over 15,000, which is an increase of 43% over that allocated in 2011.  This is more SNAs than we have ever had previously and will ensure that all children who qualify for SNA support can continue to receive access to such support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500083#WRF07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":286,"content":"<p>Question No. 145 answered with Question No. 142.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":287,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 146 and 147 answered with Question No. 143.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500084#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[45267\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500084#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which adequate provision is being made to meet the full extent of primary and second level school requirements in Celbridge, County Kildare;

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. <\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Capital Programme continues to address the challenge posed by a rapidly increasing school population.

When completed, this assessment will quantity the number of prefabs to be replaced. It is intended that this assessment, when finalised, will enable the replacement of such prefabs to commence in 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500084#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Health and Safety","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500084#WRG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[45282\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500084#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department has examined the danger posed at a school (details supplied) in which a gas tank is located close to a fire hazard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[45283\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500084#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the need for building repairs at a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>My Department has been advised by the Design and Build Contractors and their Consultant Engineers on this building project that the tanks are located approximately 13 metres from the building.

The methodology takes account of output forecasts, in money terms, for various segments of the construction industry, the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) and the relationship between apprentice intake and employment trends in the sectors.

A system of concurrent, or secondary, accreditations allows us to manage relations with a wider range of countries than those where we have missions. Missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests, including advancing government policies, in particular with the EU and the UN, providing frontline consular services to Irish citizens overseas, supporting Irish culture and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s visibility overseas. This work helps to cement our values and extend our influence on matters of interest to us, enhancing our global visibility and outreach.    Missions are instrumental to the organisation and conduct of Ministerial-led Trade missions and the Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme of promotional visits and events both of which are crucial in maintaining contacts and influence with business and political leaders. In partnership with the State Agencies missions advance Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, education and investment objectives. The success of these collaborative promotional activities conducted in priority markets is illustrated by the impressive growth in relevant trade figures over recent years. For example, it estimated that the Irish food and beverage sector grew by 2% in 2016 to reach &euro;11.5bn, representing growth of over 41% since 2010. Total overseas visitor numbers have grown every year since 2010 and last year grew by 10% to a record 9.5 million visitors. Exports by Enterprise Ireland client companies have also shown impressive growth in recent years surpassing the &euro;20bn mark for the first time last year. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining a permanent corps of officers experienced in international affairs is vital to derive the maximum benefit from Ireland&rsquo;s international engagement. In relative terms, the Irish Foreign Service is modest in size: 54 of Ireland&rsquo;s missions abroad have one or two diplomatic officers, while only 12 have more than three. In addition to the Department&rsquo;s own staff who undertake postings, we oversee the posting of officers from all Government Departments and other offices to Ireland&rsquo;s mission network. The number of Irish officials posted to our diplomatic missions for the 2016\/17 period is 380. The number of accompanying family members is 392 for the 2016\/2017 period. <\/p>  <p>  All our diplomats are civil servants; both when based at HQ and abroad they are paid the standard salary for their grade as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is subject to the normal taxation and social security obligations of civil servants. In common with other diplomatic services, this Department further supports officers who are assigned abroad to serve the State in an official capacity through a system of Foreign Service Allowances. This is to assist in defraying the additional costs to officers and their families of moving and living abroad. Allowances are based on independently sourced data. In line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanction, Foreign Service Allowances are required to be reviewed once a year, or more often in locations that experience substantial fluctuation in key economic indicators on currency and exchange rates. The components of the allowance system are:<\/p>  <p>Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)  , which is designed to estimate and defray costs associated with a higher cost of living at the post abroad. The department uses the services of an independent firm to provide cost of living indices for the various locations required. COLA only becomes payable at posts with a higher cost of living index than Dublin.<\/p>  <p>Local Post Allowance (LPA)  , which assists mainly with the additional indirect costs arising from the representational role of the officers. This allowance which varies according to marital status and grade is payable at all locations abroad. Officers serving in designated &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; posts may also be currently entitled to a hardship allowances as part of their LPA.<\/p>  <p>Children&rsquo;s Foreign Allowance (CFA)  , which compensates an officer for the additional costs incurred with regard to qualifying children at post.<\/p>  <p>  These allowances are temporary. They are not classified as allowances in the nature of pay and are not subject to income tax as they are designed to defray the additional costs to officers of living and working abroad for the period of the assignment. Provision is made in the Finance Act 2005 for the tax treatment of Foreign Service Allowances. <\/p>  <p>  The total amount paid to staff in the form of Foreign Services Allowances in 2016 was &euro;11,174,118. This total is made up of COLA, LPA and CFA; in 2016, COLA amounted to &euro;3,829,738; LPA (including Hardship) amounted to &euro;6,251,432; and CFA amounted to &euro;1,092,948.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Provision","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH01000"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[45225\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); if there is recourse available regarding their property; if assistance can be given to the person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that our Embassy in Madrid, our Honorary Consulate in Las Palmas and my Department&rsquo;s Consular Division in Dublin have provided ongoing consular assistance to the Irish citizen in question since being made aware of his detention in 2013.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Wicklow Division, on 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 299. There are also<b><\/b>21 Garda Reserves and 24 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 21 of whom have been assigned to the Wicklow Division. I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Wicklow Division in the coming years. <\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021.<\/p><p>The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015. In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sexual Offences Data","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH02500"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[45183\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason he refuses to fund a second sexual abuse and violence in Ireland survey in view of the fact that it has the support of numerous Cabinet Ministers and that there is a need for reliable and updated statistics in order to adequately respond to this issue (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The Government is totally committed to preventing and addressing sexual abuse and gender-based violence in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The 2002 SAVI report was a ground-breaking study when it was published but much has changed for the better in the 15 years since then.<\/p>  <p>  We now can draw on some excellent data sources including the EU-wide Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) study on violence against women (2014) which provided comparative prevalence data across all 28 EU member states and included modules on cyber stalking and cyber harassment.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Eurobarometer study also provided comparative data for each of the 28 member states on attitudes to violence against women in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Eurostat, the EU statistics body, is gearing up to survey gender-based violence victimisation.

It is the policy of that Office to ensure that the special needs of vulnerable applicants are addressed at each stage of the investigation and determination process in that office. This includes when an application for international protection is first made and subsequently at the interview and investigation stages.<\/p>  <p>  Extensive training is provided to staff in the IPO known as international protection officers for this purpose many of whom worked in the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. Training programmes have been developed in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in line with international best practice. <\/p>  <p>  Under section 15 of the International Protection Act 2015, an applicant is instructed to set out all information that would be relevant in the event that they are refused Refugee Status and Subsidiary Protection and are seeking permission to remain in the state under section 49 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  If an applicant is not granted a permission to remain at first instance an applicant can put forward any further information, including humanitarian considerations, that they would like the Minister to take into account that becomes relevant and this will be reviewed by an officer of the Minister before a Deportation Order is made. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of applicants who had their Asylum \/ Subsidiary Protection applications dealt with prior to commencement of the Act, these are considered under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), on whether or not to make a Deportation Order.  Cases must be considered under all of the headings set out in section 3(6) of the Act, including: the age of the person, the duration of their residence in the State, the person's family and domestic circumstances, the nature of the person's connection(s) with the State, their employment record and employment prospects, their character and conduct, including any criminal convictions, the representations, if any, made by or on behalf of the person, considerations of national security and public policy and any humanitarian issues advanced in support of the case to remain in the State.<\/p>  <p>  A refoulement consideration must also be carried out. This is an assessment of the safety of returning that person to their country of origin or place of former habitual residence having regard for the political and human rights conditions prevailing in that country at that point in time. This consideration will require the relevant applicant's claims in this regard to be examined against relevant, up to date, information, from reputable sources, relating to the conditions prevailing in the relevant country of origin. Clearly, no person can be returned to their country of origin, or their place of former habitual residence, where there is a credible risk to their life or freedom. <\/p>  <p>  Consideration must also be given to that person's rights to a private and a family life, as provided for under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to all of the above factors, I am advised that in circumstances where a person advances medically based reasons for not wishing to return to their country of origin, or their place of former habitual residence, any such issues must also be examined having regard for the provisions of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. <\/p>  <p>  Only after all of these matters have been considered, and the appropriate evidence based conclusions drawn, can a decision to deport be made either under the International Protection Act 2015 or the 1999 Immigration Act. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that all matters advanced by a person facing deportation are  considered in detail before the ultimate decision, to deport or not to deport, is taken.

Many choose not to, opting to stay with family or friends or have independent means to support themselves.  When a final decision is made on an application, a person is either granted permission to remain in Ireland or refused that permission. <\/p>  <p>  For those with leave to remain in the State, we are working with the NGO community, housing agencies, local authorities and religious groups to provide assistance to move into permanent accommodation in communities around Ireland. People who wish to make offers of accommodation to such persons should do so through the Irish Red Cross who are handling this matter on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality. <\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, it is incumbent on those with deportation orders to remove themselves from the State.  It is an integral part of the immigration regime of all developed States that those who have been given due process and have been determined to have no right to be in the State should remove themselves, or if failing to do so be removed by the appropriate authorities.  A Deportation Order arises after an extensive process where applicants have every opportunity to present their claim for asylum or other types of leave to remain, including various appeal stages.  This is the final step and most people voluntarily comply with the Deportation Order.  In that context, it is unreasonable to expect that persons with Deportation Orders can continue in State provided accommodation indefinitely.  <\/p>  <p>  Continuing to allocate limited accommodation to people who are legally obliged to remove themselves from the State would undermine our laws and adversely impact our capacity to assist those who are seeking refugee status. At current rate of demand, accommodation capacity in the Centres will run out for all applicants within a number of weeks unless remedial action is taken.  In order to meet our international obligations, we must apply the law and we must do so in a fair and transparent way.  It will become increasingly difficult to meet the needs of those seeking international protection if those who have exhausted every legal avenue and been found not to qualify remain in the State and in accommodation provided by the State.  <\/p>  <p>  The engagement by RIA is to progress matters, to reach mutual agreement in cases where persons continue to reside in RIA for extended periods. Obviously, full consideration is given to each case taking all aspects of each situation into account. People who have leave to remain or have been issued with a deportation order can no longer be considered to be asylum seekers and are reminded that they need to arrange to leave state provided accommodation as they are no longer entitled to reside in accommodation that is provided solely for those in the protection process. This in no way should be considered as an eviction process.  <\/p>  <p>  In the final analysis the State meets all its international obligations, including to meet the needs (i.e. full bed and board including all utilities, welfare payments, medical facilities, etc.) of those in the protection process and ensure that full and due process is afforded to those seeking protection, as well as follow-up on the outcomes of that process.  <\/p>  <p>  If a person requires assistance to comply with a Deportation Order, they may contact the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service who will assist them in that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":379,"content":"<p>Question No. 183 answered with Question No. 181.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Prisoners Abroad","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH03900"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[45211\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500085#WRH04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if contact can be made with the authorities in Turkey with a view to possible repatriation of a person (details supplied) who has received a six and a half year sentence for a trivial offence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that it would not be appropriate for my Department to contact another state to request the repatriation of a sentenced prisoner.

Securing access to medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service. However, the challenge is delivering on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way. <\/p>  <p>  The new four-year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, signed in July 2016 is an agreement between the State and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), and is expected to deliver approximately &euro;600 million in savings over the lifetime of the Agreement from IPHA companies and &euro;150 million in savings from non-IPHA companies. These savings have been taken into account in the 2017 HSE National Service Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The new Agreement contains a number of features which represent clear additional value over the terms of the previous 2012 Agreement. The reference basket of countries used to set prices in Ireland has been expanded from 9 to 14 countries and, importantly, includes lower cost countries. For the first time, the Agreement provides for an annual price realignment, which will ensure that the prices of medicines in Ireland reduce in line with price reductions across the reference countries.  This will ensure the State achieves better value for money on the cost of medicines as prices in other basket countries are adjusted downwards over time. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Agreement secured a 30% reduction in the price of biologic medicines when a biosimilar medicine enters the market.  The HSE included a savings target of &euro;148m in the National Service Plan 2017 for drug related savings arising from the agreement and the launch of a biosimilar for Embrel in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy to promote the rational use of biosimilar medicines and to create a sustainable environment for biological medicines in Ireland.  Biosimilar medicines provide an opportunity for long term sustainable savings on the public medicines bill, savings which can be then redirected into procuring approved new medicines.  I expect this policy to be published in early 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provided for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Act permits pharmacists to substitute medicines prescribed, provided they have been designated as safely interchangeable by the Health Products Regulatory Authority. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in this group, regardless of the individual medicines&rsquo; price. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to examine new ways to achieve efficiencies in the cost of medicines. There is a major long term and strategic programme of work underway within the HSE Medicines Management Programme and the National Drugs Management Programme to maximise return from the investment in new medicines. The HSE has established the HSE Drugs Management Portfolio with the aim of ensuring equitable access to medicines for patients, value for the taxpayer and the cost-effective provision of medicines in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is participating in a number of voluntary EU forums, including the Roundtable meetings with EU Health Ministers and the Pharmaceutical Industry, High Level Pharmaceutical Policy Meetings and the Valletta Technical Committee.  These platforms are currently exploring possible areas for cooperation including information sharing, horizon scanning and possible price negotiations and joint procurement. Such platforms could also lead to faster access for patients for some treatments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500086#WRJ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Provision","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500086#WRJ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[45156\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500086#WRJ05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if orthodontic treatment for a person (details supplied) will expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":468,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500086#WRJ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paediatric Services","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500086#WRJ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[45162\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500086#WRJ06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to introduce paediatric interventional radiology prior to the establishment of the national children's hospital; if so, the location of same; if funding will be made available for same; the measures being taken to hire the required staff; the timeframe involved in commencing this service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>Arrangements are currently in place to provide for a small number of paediatric radiology interventions to be carried out by an adult radiologist and some of the paediatric radiologists on a case-by-case basis.

Food Wise 2025 identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up Food Wise 2025 believed that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.

Member States with direct payments per hectare less than 90% of the EU average may transfer up to 25% from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1 on an annual basis.

The rationale for the measure was that a licence should indicate a person&rsquo;s suitability to carry out a function and should not have, by association, a monetary value or be trade-able on the open market.  As quantitative restrictions have been removed from the taxi market and there are no barriers to entry to this industry - other than the obligation to use a wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) - it is not clear how the transferring of licences on the open market now (as proposed by the Deputy's question) would deliver benefits to the industry or members of the public, especially those who require access to WAVs.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of motor insurance, increased premium costs for drivers are concerning.  It is clear that the increased costs of motor insurance for all drivers, particularly in the couple of years up to 2016, has also affected those working within the SPSV industry.  I am informed that there some early signs that this trend is beginning to regress with recent CSO figures showing that motor premiums generally were 14% lower in September 2017 compared with a year earlier. <\/p>  <p>  The pricing of insurance products is a commercial issue for insurance companies, based on an assessment of the risks that they are willing to accept. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am keenly aware of the how insurance issues are affecting the taxi industry.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Finance Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January of this year. Based on recommendations from this report, the Advisory Committee on SPSVs met with Insurance Ireland on 22 May to discuss cost of insurance issues relating to the taxi industry and a report on the same was issued to me on 21 June. I have forwarded the report to Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, who is the chair of the aforementioned Working Group.  That Group is already pursuing many of the recommendations arising from the meeting, including the need for further engagement to take place between the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles and Insurance Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It is my hope that this cooperation and engagement will deliver better rates for all motorists including taxi drivers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500088#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500088#WRL01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500088#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[45131\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500088#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the action she is taking to ensure that a centre (details supplied) does not close; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":571,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question refers to a specific centre which I understand operates as an independent company limited by guarantee.

Findings from the Agricultural Catchments Programme (ACP) operated by Teagasc support the current closed periods in Ireland.  A key message from the research is that there are disproportionately high nutrient losses to waters from agriculture during the winter and the current closed period coincides with the time during which risks of incidental nutrient losses to water are highest.

A weekly average of 350 HAP tenancies have been set-up during 2017.<\/p><p>HAP is a form of social housing support under which local authorities will make monthly payments on behalf of tenants directly to landlords in respect of rent, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.

The scheme has a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities, and a 99% rent payment rate with minimal difficulties arising for landlords.  HAP provides landlords with many advantages including that the landlord does not have to collect the rent; payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on the tenant's behalf; landlords who rent to tenants in receipt of HAP may avail of increased tax relief; and changes in a tenant's employment circumstances do not affect the rental payments made to the landlord. <\/p><p>In order to highlight the benefits of HAP and to provide information on the scheme to interested parties, my Department has taken a number of targeted communications actions during 2017, including the provision of a dedicated HAP website which provides prospective HAP landlords and  tenants with the information they need to understand how the HAP scheme works.

Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process. <\/p>  <p>  In this context the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas.  The Defence Capital envelope for the period 2018-2021 is &euro;416m and this will enable investment in major equipment platforms, including the refurbishment and replacement of Naval Service Vessels.   <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet.  A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service.  The third ship in the programme, L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats, was commissioned in to service in October 2016.  A contract for an additional sister ship was placed with Babcock International, a British company, in June 2016 bringing investment in the new ships programme to over &euro;250 million since 2010.  The fourth ship, to be named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw is scheduled for delivery in mid-2018.     <\/p>  <p>  The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with an ongoing maintenance regime for all vessels within the fleet, and the continuous process of refurbishment, refit and repair, will ensure that the operational capabilities of the Naval Service, as the States principal seagoing agency, are maintained to the greatest extent.   <\/p>  <p>  The service life of a Naval Service ship is determined by the level of operational activity. It is normal practice in a ship's life cycle to carry out a mid-life refurbishment programme so as to extend the useful life of the ship to thirty or more years.  In that regard, the Defence Organisation has commenced planning for a mid-life refurbishment programme for the L&Eacute; Roisin (built in 1999) and the L&Eacute; Niamh (built in 2001).  This structured mid-life refurbishment programme will future proof the vessels, allow for preventative maintenance and address obsolescence of equipment through capitalising on advancements in technology, thus ensuring reliability of the vessels for the next 15 years. <\/p>  <p>  Three ships in the current flotilla are over 30 years old (L&Eacute; Eithne and L&Eacute; Ciara were built in 1984 and L&Eacute; Orla was built in 1985).  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) which will be enabled for helicopter operations and will also have a freight carrying capacity.

However, this is not new and the Defence Forces have always had a significant turnover of personnel on an annual basis.  A certain level of turnover is, of course, desirable as a human resource and organisational objective, in order to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces and to retain an approach to regular revitalisation. <\/p>  <p>  In order to fill vacancies within the PDF establishment of 9,500 personnel there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that approximately 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  A range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.  I have also directed civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to facilitate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill-sets to re-enter the Defence Forces.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is also a significant ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of pay, following sign up by the Defence Forces Representative Associations to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, members of the Permanent Defence Force have benefitted from pay increases.  I was particularly pleased with recent adjustments to salary scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on scale point).  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 -2020 also provides for further pay increases ranging from 5.75% to 7.25% depending on the individual&rsquo;s current wage threshold and this is under consideration by RACO and PDFORRA.  The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is also a welcome development.   <\/p>  <p>  I remain committed to maximising recruitment to the Defence Forces and ensuring that, where possible, the terms and conditions of service are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters.   <\/p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and abroad.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500089#WRM06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Expenditure","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500089#WRM06600"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[45334\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500089#WRM06700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the payroll costs for the Defence Forces in each of the years since 2009, in tabular form.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>Pay and allowance costs for the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) are provided for in Subheads A.3 and A.4 of the Defence Vote. <\/p><p>Expenditure for the period from 2009 to 2017 (to end-Sept) is as follows: <\/p><p><b>Permanent Defence Force<\/b><b>Pay &amp;amp; Allowances<\/b><table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>2009 <\/th><th>2010 <\/th><th>2011 <\/th><th>2012 <\/th><th>2013 <\/th><th>2014 <\/th><th>2015 <\/th><th>2016 <\/th><th>2017 (end-Sept) <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>PDF Pay &euro;m <\/td><td>475 <\/td><td>433 <\/td><td>421 <\/td><td>395 <\/td><td>413 <\/td><td>396 <\/td><td>390 <\/td><td>386 <\/td><td>297 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PDF Allowances &euro;m <\/td><td>62 <\/td><td>44 <\/td><td>42 <\/td><td>43 <\/td><td>40 <\/td><td>34 <\/td><td>34 <\/td><td>35 <\/td><td>29 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017102500089#WRM06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
