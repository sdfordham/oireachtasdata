The two principal transaction costs are the payments required to be made by me, in my capacity as Minister for Finance, under Government guarantees and any payments to be made to NAMA to cover any shortfall (should one arise) following the sale of IBRC&rsquo;s assets by the Special Liquidators.   It was initially estimated that there could be payments required to be made by the Minister for Finance under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme of circa &euro;0.9 billion to &euro;1.1 billion.  The ELG Scheme provides an Irish State guarantee for specific issuances of eligible debt securities by participating institutions and for specific deposits placed with participating institutions.  Any such payments would impact on GGB and GGD in the year that the transaction takes place.  From an impact analysis perspective, it was initially assumed that ELG costs of &euro;1.0 billion will arise in 2013, i.e., the midpoint of the circa &euro;0.9 billion to &euro;1.1 billion estimated range.  An updated assessment of the expected ELG costs has been prepared by the Special Liquidators.  This revised estimate now suggests that ELG costs will be in the region of circa &euro;1.0 billion.<\/p><p>  A Derivatives Guarantee is also provided by the Minister for Finance which guarantees all amounts payable by IBRC to derivative counterparties.  It was not possible to produce a meaningful estimate with respect to potential costs under the Derivatives Guarantee at the time of the transaction.  An assessment has now been prepared by the Special Liquidators which suggests that costs under the Derivatives Guarantee are expected to lie within the &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million range.<\/p><p>  Separately, a Deposit Guarantee Scheme is in place which provides a guarantee of up to &euro;100,000 per eligible depositor per institution.  This scheme is funded by credit institutions lodging funds in a Deposit Protection Account maintained at the Central Bank.  An assessment of the expected DGS costs has been prepared by the Special Liquidators, which suggests that DGS costs are expected to be less than &euro;50 million.  In any case, any payment from this fund does not represent a direct cost to the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>  So the total cost to the Exchequer as a result of the liquidation of IBRC is expected to be circa &euro;1.1 billion, comprising costs under the ELG Scheme of circa &euro;1.0 billion and costs under the Derivatives Guarantee of circa &euro;50 to &euro;100 million.  This is broadly in line with initial estimates produced by my Department.<\/p><p>  I also want to point out that, to the extent that there were assets available to settle unsecured creditors in the liquidation process the Minister for Finance would stand pari passu with other unsecured creditors and would be entitled to a clawback of some or all of the amounts paid out under guarantees.  Indeed, the CBI would also stand pari passu with other unsecured creditors with respect to any amounts paid out under the DGS &ndash; and would, therefore, also be entitled to a clawback of some or all of the amounts paid out under the DGS depending on the availability of assets to settle such unsecured claims.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note that the Minister for Finance will also be required to compensate NAMA if the amount raised from the sale of assets by the Special Liquidator is insufficient to cover amounts due to NAMA.  The Special Liquidators are appointing independent valuation experts to determine the value of the assets but the shortfall, if any, will not be known, with any certainty, until the independent valuation and asset sale process has completed.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[13939\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline the possible implications for Budget 2014 of the promissory note deal and any future deal on banking debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>As I have stated previously, it is important to note that some aspects of the promissory note deal are yet to be finalised. For example, the liquidator is in the process of overseeing a valuation and sales process for the assets of IBRC, while the final payments to be made under the ELG Scheme have not yet been determined. Nevertheless, simulations ran by my Department estimate that the General Government deficit will improve by approximately &#8364;1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us &#8364;1 billion closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015. However, this has to be seen in the light of the estimated General Government deficits of &#8364;8.9bn and &#8364;5.3bn in 2014 and 2015 respectively, as per <i>Budget 2013<\/i>  .<\/p><p><br \/>  While this agreement is a significant step forward in restoring sustainability to our public finances, this Government is well aware that there remains a considerable gap between what we get in revenue and what we spend.

This means that the property owner must decide the market value of his or her own property and make a return to Revenue. In the absence of a national residential property valuation system, the valuation guidance developed by Revenue is designed to help property owners in self-assessing the market value of their property by giving them average, indicative values for their area.   The Revenue guidance is based on a detailed analysis of all property sales in the State since January 2010. The guidance provides a benchmark to help people consider whether their particular property is more or less valuable than the average in an area. This guidance will be helpful in the majority of cases but there are always properties in an area that differ from the average.<\/p><p>  The valuation guidance explicitly states that: &ldquo;This service provides a guide to average market values of properties in a given locality and offers an indicative valuation band for properties depending on type, age and location. It does not provide market values for individual properties.&rdquo; <\/p><p>  This guidance should not be used in isolation but together with other sources of information and the property owner&rsquo;s knowledge of their neighbourhood and their own property.  In this regard, I welcome that there is a range of guidance now available to property owners to help them self-assess.<\/p><p>  Revenue has made the guidance as simple as possible &ndash; users need only know their property&rsquo;s type, age and location.  The Revenue valuation guidance website combines two aspects &ndash; a simple point and click option to get an average valuation for an area (electoral district), combined with a &lsquo;heat map&rsquo; showing relative valuations across electoral districts. <\/p><p>  The valuation guidance website is a successful collaborative project between Revenue and Ordnance Survey Ireland, the national mapping authority. The site was developed by Revenue at a cost of &euro;48,250 including VAT.  This includes the development cost, external advice on the choice of system and an estimate of the project management and quality assurance time.  For completeness, this does not include the staff time and costs attributable to the Local Property Tax project overall which could not easily be disaggregated and would have been incurred even if the valuation guidance website had not been developed.<\/p><p>  The Revenue guidance follows similar methods to those used by tax administrations in other countries and meets internationally accepted standards for this type of work.  In addition, it compares favourably to research in Ireland, including work by researchers in the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  Other valuation guidance and models in Ireland, for example those produced by some property or real estate listings websites, also use similar methods to providing average valuations.<\/p><p>  I am completely satisfied that the Revenue valuation guidance is fit for purpose and performs at least equally well, if not better, than other sources of valuation information that are available. I am confident that the Revenue valuation guidance will be useful for the majority of property owners in assisting them to value their homes. Furthermore, the use of the online mapping application, to provide the guidance, is an excellent example of the public sector using GIS (Geographic Information System) technology in a new and innovative manner.<\/p><p>  Finally I would point out that all Revenue is asking &ndash; and all I am asking, as Minister &ndash; is for property owners to take a reasonable view of the value of their own property, and to be honest.  The level of public debate this week on property valuation suggests that most people are engaging with the Local Property Tax, have a good general sense of the value of their property, are carrying out research to enable them to do their self-assessed return, and I welcome that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Staff","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[14062\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will meet the former workers at the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation to discuss their situation regarding redundancy entitlements.","asker":"1083","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the significant efforts and commitment made by the staff in IBRC over the past few difficult years whilst the bank was in wind down and the difficulties that arise for staff as a result of the liquidation but it was necessary to take the decision to liquidate IBRC in the larger public interest.   There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules.  However the State could intervene, if required, to ensure that statutory redundancy is available through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to EUR600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.<\/p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that officials within my Department have already met with the IBOA and issues surrounding the status of the employees of the IBRC (in liquidation) were discussed.

Revenue is aware of the threat that this criminal activity poses to law-abiding businesses, and to the Exchequer in terms of lost revenue from mineral oil tax. The laundering process also threatens the environment, through the waste sludge that it generates, and laundered fuel can damage the engines of vehicles in which it is used.    Combating this illegal activity is, therefore, a high priority for Revenue and enforcement action is taken at all stages of the fuel supply chain, against both those involved in the laundering process and those who sell laundered fuel. Considerable success is being achieved in this work. During 2012 11 oil laundries were detected and laundering equipment, materials and vehicles were seized, along with 199,000 litres of oil. A further 914,000 litres of illicit fuel were also seized, the greater part from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. In addition, 57 retail outlets were shut down in the course of 2012 for trading without a licence for the sale of fuel or for breach of licence conditions, following the closure of 32 outlets during 2011.<\/p><p>  Because of the links that organised criminality has with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it. A Cross-Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, involving all relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland, also facilitates and enhances cooperation in dealing with this form of criminality. Arising from its work, a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, which operate in both jurisdictions, have been specifically targeted for investigation.<\/p><p>  In addition to the ongoing enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced supervision throughout the fuel supply chain, to deny fuel launderers access to marked fuel for laundering and to deny them access to market for their illegal product. Following on from a more robust approach to licensing requirements for the sale of auto-fuel adopted since 2011, a new licensing requirement for marked fuel traders came into operation from 1 October 2012. As well as these important licensing changes, there is a new requirement, effective as and from the start of this year, for all fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns on their fuel transactions to Revenue. This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity in oil trading, and in taking action against fraudulent activity.<\/p><p>  Revenue is also working in close cooperation with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs on obtaining an improved and more effective fuel marker. There was a very good response to a joint invitation to make submissions on the provision of a new marker, and the submissions received are being evaluated at present.<\/p><p>   The extensive enforcement action that is being taken against illegal activity in the fuel market highlights the commitment to combating it. The new legislative steps that have been taken, together with the work on development of a more effective fuel marker, will serve to enhance the effectiveness of this action, and there will be no letting up in the work against those involved in this form of criminality.<\/p><p>  On the matter of solid fuel carbon tax, the Revenue Commissioners will collect this tax on a self-assessed basis and will apply the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.  <\/p><p>  Any  person who makes a first supply of solid fuel in the State must register with the Revenue Commissioners and will be accountable and liable for payment of the tax. In circumstances where there are grounds to believe that a taxable supply of solid fuel has not been tax paid, including a supply by persons operating in the shadow economy, Revenue will investigate the person&rsquo;s tax liabilities in accordance with the particular circumstances of each case.  If confirmed, Revenue will enforce the collection of any unpaid tax and if offences have been committed under any part of the tax code, will take action to prosecute those offences.<\/p><p>  Solid fuel carbon tax will become operational in a market that is already subject to strict regulation.  Regulations to enable local authorities to control the type of coal supplied in the State have been put in place as part of the robust mechanism introduced by the Minister for the Environment to address the risk of coal products with lower environmental standards being sourced from outside the State, in particular Northern Ireland.    <\/p><p>  Suppliers who are producing and supplying solid fuel unlawfully are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State Agencies charged with enforcing environmental regulations and preventing such supply. Revenue will liaise with these bodies, as required, to ensure that lawful supplies of solid fuels are properly taxed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Exemptions","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[14061\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will carry out an impact assessment of the property tax on the numbers of those in mortgage arrears.","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>The Government has considered the impact of the Local Property Tax (LPT) on those in mortgage arrears.  The Thornhill Group (the inter-departmental group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill to consider the design of a property tax) acknowledged that in current circumstances an additional case should be made to target assistance on owner occupiers suffering severe financial stress as a result of housing mortgage commitments undertaken during the housing boom period, aggravated in some cases by reductions in income.  The Thornhill Group recommended increased deferral thresholds in cases where the mortgage was taken out between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008.    The Government accepted the Thornhill Group&#8217;s recommendation but decided not to limit the increased thresholds to those who purchased properties during a particular time period.  Therefore, an increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds for both full and partial deferrals may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement &#8211; i.e. a Debt Settlement Arrangement or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 &#8211; may qualify for a deferral of the LPT that falls due for payment by that person during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect where a valid claim is made to the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p><br \/>  This 2013 Act also introduces new measures which provide for the possibility of a deferral for liable persons who cannot without excessive hardship pay local property tax when it becomes payable, as a consequence of a significant and unexpected financial loss or expense (subject to the application for a deferral from the liable person to the Revenue Commissioners, in line with Revenue guidelines to be published, and notification from the Revenue that a deferral is allowed).<\/p><p><br \/>  The Thornhill Group recommended that the LPT paid in respect of a rented property should be deductible for income tax or corporation tax purposes, in a similar manner to commercial rates and suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years. There is no provision in the legislation for such deductions at present. However, it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis, though the manner and timing of this has yet to be decided.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Taking all of the above measures into account, I believe any impact of the LPT on mortgage arrears will be limited.<\/p><p>Turning to mortgage arrears in general, this Government is conscious of the difficulty some home owners are experiencing in meeting their mortgage obligations and is committed to helping homeowners in distress to weather the recession, and to ensuring that Ireland has a sustainable housing policy. The main focus of attention is on those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty in meeting the commitments in respect of their home.  As set out in my Department&#8217;s <i>Review of 2012, <\/i>  much work was done in relation to mortgage arrears and personal indebtedness to assist those in difficulty. A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, was established to oversee implementation of the Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Report) Report&#8217;s recommendations. The following key milestones were delivered in 2012:<\/p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Bill was published by the Department of Justice in June 2012;<\/p><p>- The Mortgage to Rent scheme was formally launched by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in June 2012;<\/p><p>- A three-phased approach to establishing a comprehensive Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service to provide the necessary supports to assist people in mortgage distress was launched by the Department of Social Protection in September 2012;<\/p><p>- The banks, with Central Bank oversight, completed pilots and commenced the roll-out of strategies and solutions to address loan arrears and unsustainable debt in October 2012; and<\/p><p>- A CEO was appointed by the Department of Justice to mobilise and operationalise the Insolvency Service of Ireland in October 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  The new Personal Insolvency Act was signed into law at the end of 2012. The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of unsustainable personal debt (including mortgage debt) and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement. Complementing this legislation is a comprehensive set of measures implemented by the banks following detailed consultation with my Department.  These include:<\/p><p>- An increase in staffing resources allocated to assisting in arrears management;<\/p><p>- The provision of alternative mortgage servicing arrangements; and<\/p><p>- A more focussed strategy encompassing engagement, stabilisation and resolution.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2013 we will build on the progress made to date by continuing to lead key stakeholders, through chairing the Mortgage Arrears Steering Group, to deliver the remaining elements of the Mortgage Arrears programme by:<\/p><p>- The development of resolution targets by the banks, through Central Bank oversight; and<\/p><p>- The operation of the Personal Insolvency Act through the Insolvency Service of Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank, which is represented in the Steering Group, recently announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks and proposed changes to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). The new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards. The Central Bank is also proposing to update the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank will assess whether the performance targets are being met. To the extent that the banks fail to meet these targets to the satisfaction of the Central Bank and within the timeframes set out, the Central Bank may take further regulatory action, which may include, without limitation, obliging a credit institution to hold additional own funds or requiring a credit institution to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets, in terms of own funds requirements. This is without prejudice to the power of the Central Bank to take regulatory action at an earlier date where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[14045\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied with the logistical planning undertaken to date to administer the local property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>Introducing a new tax regime for residential property in such a tight timeframe has been a significant challenge for the Revenue Commissioners along with all of their other responsibilities.  Enacting the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act in December 2012 provided the basis for the development of the necessary systems.  A small number of amendments were made to the original Act, which included some further exemptions from the charge and new types of deferral arrangements.  These amendments were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 which was signed into law by the President on 13 March 2013.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) sets out how Local Property Tax (LPT) is to be administered and how a residential property is to be valued for LPT purposes. Since the Government&rsquo;s announcement last July that the Revenue Commissioners would be responsible for the administration of this new tax, the Commissioners have had extensive contacts with a wide range of Government Departments and Agencies through the Interdepartmental Group which was set up last August to help plan the introduction of LPT.  <\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of payment options have been made available to liable persons, which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or by way of phased payments.  Bi-lateral meetings have been held with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that the deduction at source option from certain payments administered by these Departments would be available to property owners.  Meetings to assess progress on the necessary developments required to implement the deduction at source options are ongoing.  <\/p><p>  In addition, detailed discussions have also taken place with a number of private sector stakeholders including payroll administrators and payroll software specialists regarding the implementation of the deduction at source option and these groups are actively working to meet agreed timelines.  A key element of the design of the tax is that property owners will have as much flexibility as possible to spread the payment of tax in equal instalments throughout the year and this is why the facility to deduct the tax at source is of such importance.  Payment of LPT can also be made by single debit authority, debit\/credit card, direct debit and cash.  The Revenue Commissioners recently published details on their website of the payment service providers who will accept cash payments of LPT at their premises and they are An Post, Payzone and Omnivend.  The three organisations concerned have a major nationwide reach that will ensure the widest possible availability of facilities where LPT payments can be made.<\/p><p>  The additional resources required by Revenue for 2013 are noted in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Expenditure Report 2013.  The Employment Control Framework includes 100 additional posts approved by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in the context of the introduction of LPT.  The Commissioners further advise that a Local Property Tax Branch, under the Office of the Collector-General, is now fully established in Ennis, Co. Clare to manage all aspects of the administration of the tax for both resident and non-resident customers.  The Commissioners are deploying additional staff to this Branch by reconfiguring their District structure in the South West and relocating functions from Clare to Limerick.  In addition, Revenue has contracted for external service delivery of some data capture and call centre services.  At this point, Revenue&rsquo;s dedicated LPT Helpline (at 1890 200 255) is fully functional and will be resourced appropriately to handle the anticipated high number of contacts.<\/p><p>  A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State which is the cornerstone of the new tax.  The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  This Register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine the Register and ensure, as far as possible, that all property owners will be contacted.  The use of multiple databases does, however, bring the risk of duplication and the Commissioners have made every effort to lessen this risk.  Another important aspect of the logistical preparations for introducing LPT has been the development of the IT systems for administering and collecting the new tax and its incorporation into Revenue&rsquo;s existing IT infrastructure.  I am advised by the Commissioners that these systems are also in place. <\/p><p>  The Commissioners have prepared valuation guidance which, taken together with the owner&rsquo;s own knowledge of the property, will assist him or her in assessing its value.  The guidance includes an on-line interactive valuation guide which provides indicative property valuation bands depending on the property type, age and location. This facility was made available on the Revenue website on 10 March and has seen extensive use with almost 600,000 &ldquo;hits&rdquo; recorded in its first four days of operation.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that last week Revenue began the general issue of LPT Returns, an explanatory booklet and related information to the owners of 1.66 million properties who will be obliged to file their Returns by the relevant deadline - 7 May for those filing paper Returns and 28 May for those filing their Return on-line.  The first property owners to have received the correspondence occurred on Wednesday 13 March and up to Friday 15 March, 178,941 letters had been posted by Revenue.  The general issue of correspondence, given the volumes involved, is likely to run for four weeks.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that property owners will have the option of completing and submitting their LPT return in paper or by electronic means.  Revenue has developed a secure on-line system for filing LPT Returns that is user friendly and easily accessible on the Revenue website.  This on-line system also went live on 13 March.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, using the on-line system is the quickest and most straightforward way to complete and submit their LPT Returns, particularly so where there are multiple properties involved, as the system automatically calculates the LPT due for the individual properties, makes it easy to select a payment method from the wide range of options available and provides immediate access to Revenue&rsquo;s on-line valuation guide.  I am assured that all the processes and procedures required to handle the completed LPT return forms from property owners by the relevant due dates of 7 May 2013 for paper forms, and 28 May for online forms, will be in place. <\/p><p>  To coincide with the issue of LPT Returns to property owners, a public information campaign was launched on 7 March with a Press Conference delivered by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. This was followed by a number of radio and television interviews with Revenue spokespersons.  Over the coming months Revenue will make spokespersons available particular to local radio to provide advice. A publicity campaign targeting radio and the print media has also just commenced.  The Revenue website contains extensive information on how the tax will operate and the obligations for owners of residential properties, including Frequently Asked Questions which are updated regularly.  Revenue is also working closely with the Citizens Information Service to optimise the opportunities for property owners to get advice and assistance in completing their LPT Return.<\/p><p>  I am fully satisfied with the logistical planning undertaken by the Commissioners and am very pleased with the progress made to date.  I am confident that they will deliver all of the necessary milestones prior to the commencement of the new regime on 1 July 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IMF Loan Issues","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[14028\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the IMF will favourably consider a request to extend the repayment period for its loans to Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>In 2010 the IMF approved a programme under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to Ireland amounting to SDR 19.5 billion, which is equivalent to &euro;22.5 billion, as part of the overall EU\/IMF programme of financial support agreed at that time.   The appropriate amortization schedule for EFF programmes with any member country of the IMF has been agreed and set by the IMF.

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme. The Economic Management Council meets the banks on a regular basis and discusses the key issues pertaining to this priority.  My officials also meet regularly with key stakeholders at the forum of the SME Funding Consultation Committee. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland  for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks have reported that they achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. <\/p><p>In addition to these lending targets,<b><\/b>  the banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Credit Review Office can review decisions by the banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000. The Credit Review Office is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the Credit Review Office. I have received a small number of representations from individual SMEs regarding the availability of credit. I have referred some of these SMEs to the Credit Review Office which has been able to provide assistance. <\/p><p><br \/>  I recently sanctioned the appointment of six additional reviewers in the Credit Review Office to ensure that SMEs appealing the banks&#8217; decisions to decline credit receive a considered and timely response to their application.<\/p><p><br \/>  The credit stream available to SMEs now also includes the Microenterprise Loan scheme which will facilitate up to &#8364;40 million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  In addition, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme can facilitate up to &#8364;150 million per annum of additional credit. The Scheme is designed for SME&#8217;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  <\/p><p><br \/>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions Restructuring","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[14032\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100047#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the restructuring of the credit union sector will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 provides the statutory basis for the restructuring of credit unions and places the Restructuring Board (ReBo) on a statutory footing.

Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  To avail of the exemption from LPT, the social housing provider must operate as a charity and must have a general tax exemption granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners and officials from my Department have had extensive contacts regarding the LPT obligations of social housing providers either directly with the providers themselves (e.g. Focus Ireland) or indirectly through the Irish Council for Social Housing.  Guidelines are being developed which clarify what constitutes special housing needs and support in order to assist local authorities and other social housing providers to determine whether their properties are exempt from the charge to LPT.  Input was sought and received from representatives of social housing providers in connection with the development of the guidelines.  The draft guidelines are currently being considered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Irish Council for Social Housing.<\/p><p>  Where a property owned by a local authority or other provider of social housing is not exempt from the charge to LPT because it is not used to provide special needs accommodation, the Act provides that the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of zero to &euro;100,000 up to and including 2016.  This will result in an LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013 and &euro;90 per year for 2014 to 2016.  It will be a matter for local authorities and other social housing providers themselves to decide whether they will pass on the LPT liability to their tenants in the form of an increase in rent or whether they will absorb the liability without recourse to their tenants.  In addition, the Act also gives local authorities and other social housing providers until 1 January 2014 to pay the 2013 tax.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have liaised with the social housing sector to establish how local authorities and other social housing providers will provide them with information in relation to their LPT liability and the timing and manner of the payment of this liability.

However the Joint Administrators when presenting their 10th report to the High Court in July 2012 indicated that the potential call on the ICF could be up to 1.65bn euro. It should be noted that the Joint Administrators have recently indicated to my Department that this position remains broadly unchanged.  The Joint Administrators pointed out in their report that the projected call on the ICF now includes accounting adjustments and considerable contingencies which it is hoped will not be called upon. They indicated that if they were to remove most of the accounting adjustments and use a &quot;<i>best estimate&quot;<\/i> calculation, then the call on the fund is likely to be in the range of 1.1bn euro to 1.3bn euro  rather than the 1.65bn euro for which they have provided.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have been advised that the Joint Administrators have undertaken a number of actions in relation to claims settlement which can reduce the ultimate claims cost. These include as part of a new enhanced governance structure the establishment of a Claims Advisory Committee (CAC) to guide and advise them and QIL management on future claims strategy and policy.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, to protect the Exchequer interests I have ensured that the State Claims Agency is more involved in the administration process, particularly in the claims management area, which is critical to keeping the call on the ICF down to its lowest level possible. In this respect it should be noted that, at my request, Mr Ciaran Breen, Director of the State Claims Agency has been appointed as Chair of the Claims Advisory Committee.<\/p><p>The position in relation to the<b><\/b>  Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) is that it operates under the Insurance Act 1964 which was amended by the Insurance (Amendment) Act in 2011. Its purpose is to protect policy holders in the event of their insurer becoming insolvent. It is an industry financed fund. However because the scheme is not pre-funded, the Act provides for the Exchequer to advance monies on the recommendation of the Central Bank  in circumstances where insufficient funds have been generated by an industry levy to cover a large demand.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Insurance Act 1964 the responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it to at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank. Where in the Bank&#8217;s opinion the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. On the basis of its assessment of the Fund the Central Bank concluded that a levy should be applied to industry with effect from 1 January 2012 under section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964.  This matter is kept under review by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[14064\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress being made on the Programme for Government commitment to seek to dispose of the public stakes in the banks as soon as possible at the best possible return to the taxpayer.","asker":"1022","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is government policy to separate the State from its banks, a policy which I believe has shared support in this house.

It is, therefore, a matter for the Board to determine an appropriate strategy for the management of the cash reserves and assets of the Agency.  NAMA&rsquo;s cash reserves are deployed towards repaying its debt, funding capital advances to develop and complete projects, meeting its ongoing liquidity requirements, including its operating costs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is aware that NAMA&rsquo;s ultimate objective is to repay over its lifetime, at a minimum, all of the Senior Bonds issued to fund the acquisition of loans.  In this respect, NAMA&rsquo;s strong cash performance since inception has enabled the Agency to repay &euro;4.75 billion in senior bonds to date and I am advised that the Agency is firmly on course to meet the target of reducing its debt by a cumulative &euro;7.5 billion by the end of 2013.  NAMA&rsquo;s ability to meet this target is important in terms of the perception of Ireland held by international investors and by the rating agencies in the context of the country&rsquo;s return to the sovereign debt markets.  The target is also monitored closely by the Troika and influences their view of Ireland&rsquo;s progress.  NAMA expects that its end-2013 debt repayment target and the full repayment of its Senior Bonds over its lifetime will be met from income generated by debtor assets and from the proceeds of asset disposals by its debtors and receivers.<\/p><p>  In line with the overriding objective to repay its Senior Bonds, NAMA has also outlined plans to advance substantial funding over its lifetime to preserve and enhance the value of assets securing its loans, including significant funding for assets located in Ireland.  As the Deputy may be aware, NAMA has announced that it will advance funding of up &euro;2 billion in Ireland over the next four years for the completion of projects currently in progress and the development of new projects to meet prospective supply shortages in certain sectors.  This funding will be advanced entirely from NAMA&rsquo;s cash reserves.  NAMA advises that it has already approved &euro;700 million in new advances for the completion of commercial, retail and residential projects across Ireland and over &euro;1.7 billion across the entire NAMA portfolio.  NAMA&rsquo;s objective in advancing this funding is to increase the long-term recoverable value of the assets securing its loans.  In addition, NAMA has announced plans to lend at least &euro;2 billion over the next four years in vendor finance to purchasers of commercial property securing its loans.  NAMA advises that this is one of a number of measures being implemented to help monetise its portfolio in Ireland and is part of its commitment to contribute in a tangible way to sustainable recovery in the Irish property market. Through these plans, NAMA will inject &euro;4 billion into the Irish economy over the next four years, representing a significant contribution to employment and economic recovery at a time when investment is otherwise curtailed.<\/p><p>  In addition to repaying NAMA&rsquo;s debts and advancing development capital to enhance its assets, NAMA will use its cash reserves to meet the agency&rsquo;s on-going funding requirements and operational expenses.  In this context I am advised the NAMA Board considers it will not require additional resources from the Exchequer over its lifetime.  The Deputy will note that NAMA&rsquo;s operating costs in 2012 as a percentage of cash generated were of the order of 3%, which is substantially lower than that of comparable entities.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, in managing its liquidity needs, NAMA must ensure that it has available liquidity over the medium term to meet all of its contractual obligations as they fall due. Such obligations include coupon payments due on its bonds and derivative contract payments. It also, as outlined, includes its day-to-day operating costs and the advances to debtors for working capital and project funding which are often required at short notice. I am advised that updated liquidity projections, based on these various expected inflows and outflows, are reviewed on a monthly basis by the NAMA board.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also know that on the 7th February 2013, I issued a Direction (NAMA\/3\/12\/IBRC Act) to NAMA pursuant to the IBRC Act 2013 to provide such credit facilities to the Special Liquidators appointed to IBRC on such terms and conditions as specified in the direction. This was done in order to protect and preserve the value of the IBRC assets during the liquidation process and ultimately to protect the interests of the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  NAMA has complied with this Direction and made a &euro;1 billion credit facility available to the Special Liquidators.  NAMA has made this facility available in accordance with its approved liquidity policy and from its liquid assets.  NAMA advises that the granting of this facility does not impact on the Agency&rsquo;s ability to redeem its Senior Bonds in accordance with the previously indicated redemption targets or its ability to fund its operational and development capital costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Operations","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[14076\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the non-disclosure confidential document that AIB is demanding buy to let debtors sign before the bank will engage with them in mortgage negotiation discussions.","asker":"1037","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>I have been informed by AIB that as part of normal commercial activities customers may be required to sign a confidentiality agreement.

Eligible deposits in IBRC are covered by joint safeguards. Eligible deposits of up to &#8364;100,000 for an individual and &#8364;200,000 for individuals with a joint account in IBRC are protected by the DGS. Eligible deposits above this limit are guaranteed under the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG). There is no need for depositors to make a claim for compensation under the DGS. The Special Liquidators have provided details of eligible depositors and account balances to the Central Bank. Payments are then made by cheque within 20 working days of the appointment of the Special Liquidators and are sent to depositors at the address held by IBRC. In a limited number of circumstances, additional information may be required to confirm eligibility. In this instance, a formal claim is required. Depositors will be contacted but may also download relevant forms from the Central Bank website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.centralbank.ie<\/font><\/i>. The Central Bank are keeping customers of IBRC informed by providing regular updates on its website.<\/p><p><br \/>  The compensation payments have been made from the Deposit Protection Account (DPA), operated by the Central Bank of Ireland and funded by credit institutions covered by the scheme.  Each deposit-holding institution is required to maintain a balance on their DPA account of 0.2% of their total deposits (with a minimum amount of &#8364;50,000 in the case of all institutions except credit unions). The balance in the DPA was &#8364;388 million prior to this compensation event.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are no specific plans at national level to alter the operation of the DGS. However, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) in Ireland was established under Irish and European legislation to protect depositors; it therefore will be impacted by European legislation on the operation of Deposit Guarantee Schemes across Europe, which is currently the subject of negotiations.<\/p><p><br \/>  On 12 July 2010, the Commission adopted a legislative proposal for a thorough revision of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The main aim of the 2010 proposal is to significantly enhance depositors&#8217; confidence by introducing a higher level of coverage, faster payout and more credible funding of the various Deposit Guarantee Schemes. This proposal will now travel as part of the Banking Union Proposals. It addresses issues including simplification and harmonisation of the provisions of the current Directive. In particular, it looks at the scope of the coverage and arrangements for payout; optional mutual borrowing among Deposit Guarantee Schemes in certain circumstances, the introduction of an information template and better access to information for depositors.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Parliament voted in Plenary on the Deposit Guarantee Schemes proposal on 16 February 2012. This vote took place in the absence of an agreement with the Council on a number of key issues. The file is now effectively at a second reading.<\/p><p><br \/>  The last Council Working Party (attach&eacute;s) took place on 23 July 2012 in an attempt to restart the negotiation of the proposals. However, Member States were unwilling to reopen the debate fully until the Banking Resolution package is near completion as it is heavily linked to this proposal, especially with respect to the funding of the schemes. It appears that the funding issues will now be discussed in the context of Bank Recovery and Resolution Proposals and therefore as Presidency Ireland will recommence discussions of the DGS proposal in the coming weeks with a view to agreeing with the European Parliament improvements to the operation of DGS schemes across Europe in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[14057\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100048#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether reductions in the cost base at the covered banks should allow them to halt their on-going process of increasing its standard variable rate for residential mortgages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>While the Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing in the current environment, ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial matter for the management and the Board of the relevant institutions.

One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.   The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion in 2012 and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. The Credit Reviewer, Mr John Trethowan, said in his most recent quarterly report that &#8220;Both banks have achieved their &#8364;3.5bn SME loan sanction targets. Over &#8364;8bn was sanctioned in 2012; of which approx. &#8364;2.5bn (27%) is new lending drawn down.&#8221; According to the Credit Review Office, the balance of the sanctioned lending represented restructured or re-financed credit to SMEs. The Credit Review Office in the past has noted that this is important in terms of sustaining the businesses and the associated jobs.  <\/p><p>In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b><\/b>  the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets.

The banks also meet with the Department of Finance and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by the Department. My officials and I will engage robustly with the banks to ensure that they meet their 2013 targets. I think that it is important to note that the targets for 2013 represent an increase of 33% over the 2011 targets. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department&#8217;s review of 2012 is available at <i><\/i> .

However, I have been informed by the Central Bank that one of the recommendations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt was that a &#8220;standard financial statement&#8221; (SFS) should be developed for use by all lenders and MABS, to assess a borrower&#8217;s financial position and to identify a best course of action.  A standard format for the SFS was developed by the IBF and MABS and approved by the Central Bank in 2011 and all lenders are required to use this SFS when dealing with consumers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.<\/p><p><br \/>  The SFS is a key component to the effectiveness of the MARP as it requires consumers to objectively assess their incomings and outgoings, assets and liabilities and it provides the lender with valuable information regarding the financial position of the borrower.  The standard format for the SFS requires a comprehensive review of the borrower&#8217;s financial position and brings increased consistency to the process and ensures that all assessments of a borrower&#8217;s case are based on a common analysis of their financial circumstances.<\/p><p><br \/>  Guidance has been prepared for consumers by MABS and the Central Bank which informs the borrower of the importance of completion of the SFS and also the commitment of their lender to assist them with the process.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank published a consultation paper as part of a review of the CCMA on 13 March 2013 and the use of the SFS is being considered as part of this review.  In this regard since the introduction of the SFS, a number of wide ranging, and sometimes contradictory, views have been expressed.<\/p><p><br \/>  Some lenders have highlighted borrower dissatisfaction, as well as their own concerns, that the level of information sought is excessive, particularly in respect of borrowers with a more straightforward arrears situation (for example, where the borrower has had a one-off unexpected expense which has temporarily created an arrears issue). In addition, some lenders maintain that the time taken to complete and assess the SFS is leading to delays in putting arrangements in place, which can result in a deterioration of the borrower&#8217;s position, while they are awaiting the completion of the review.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, the consumer research conducted on behalf of the Central Bank concluded that 71% of borrowers surveyed were satisfied with the overall ease of completing the SFS. In addition, a number of lenders have expressed the view that the full range of information contained in the SFS is relevant and necessary in order to facilitate full consideration of the borrower&#8217;s situation. This view is supported by the Central Bank&#8217;s analysis of data from the main lenders.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recognition of the time it may take to complete and assess the SFS and the potential deterioration in a borrower&#8217;s arrears situation while this process is being carried out, the Central Bank is proposing to clarify that a lender may put a temporary arrangement in place for a period of no more than three months, prior to receiving, and completing a full review of, the SFS.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, a new requirement is proposed for lenders to offer to assist borrowers in completing the SFS.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Central Bank agrees that there may be some situations where the full range of information contained in the SFS is not required, and is seeking views on those potential situations and the information that would be required in each situation to facilitate proper consideration of the borrower&#8217;s case.<\/p><p>Further details on the full consultation can be found at following link:  <i><i> <\/i><\/i> .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100049#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100049#WRC00850"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[14059\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100049#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to tackle the growing problems with mortgage arrears; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>The Government is very aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem focusing on four main distinct areas:<\/p><p><b>Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:<\/b>    Personal insolvency reform was identified by the Keane Report as a catalyst for addressing the mortgage arrears problem and it indicated that without an effective insolvency system the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.

Revenue is making it as easy as possible for people to comply with their obligations to submit an LPT return and either make arrangements to pay their LPT charge or avail of a deferral of the charge if they are eligible.  A wide range of payment options will be available to liable persons, which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or to pay the tax in equal instalments beginning in July 2013.     For those liable persons who choose not to make an LPT Return, the Revenue Commissioners have a duty, in the interests of fairness and equity to those who are compliant, to take effective follow-up action to recover the tax from the non-compliant.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As part of the general issue of LPT Returns that began last week, liable persons are also receiving a Revenue Estimate of LPT.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of individual properties; nor, since LPT is a self-assessed tax, should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that a liable person should pay.  The Revenue Estimate is an amount of LPT that will be pursued by Revenue, in accordance with the LPT legislation, if the liable person does not complete and submit their LPT Return.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their initial compliance focus will be on the completion of the register and they will decide on the precise details, phasing and timing of the compliance campaign depending on the profile of the non-compliant population.  In the first instance, the Commissioners will pursue payment of the Revenue Estimate by mandatory deduction at source.  In these cases the non-compliant liable person will be notified prior to any such mandatory deductions taking place and an instruction will issue from Revenue to the liable person&#8217;s employer, pension provider or to certain Government Departments to deduct the appropriate amount of LPT from the liable person&#8217;s employment income, occupational pension or from certain Government payments.  These instructions will be the same irrespective of whether the deduction payment option has been voluntarily selected by the liable person, or mandatorily imposed by Revenue.  If a liable person subsequently files the LPT Return and confirms the amount of LPT due based on her\/his assessment of the value of the residential property<b>, <\/b>  Revenue will notify her\/his employer, pension provider or Government Department, as the case may be, if the amount of LPT due for payment has changed.  <\/p><p><br \/>  As regards timing, the objective will be to spread the deductions evenly over as many pay periods as possible.  In this context, it is anticipated that the compliance campaign will commence in the second half of June, and will focus initially on income from employment and occupational pensions with a view to beginning deductions from July pay dates.  A second and later phase will focus on Government payments, and in this regard the Deputy should note that if a person&#8217;s sole income is a payment from the Department of Social Protection, her\/his income will be below the thresholds to qualify for a deferral of the tax.  The timing of deductions from payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will depend on the timing of the relevant payments.<\/p><p><br \/>  Where deduction at source is not feasible, which will generally be in the case of self-assessed taxpayers, a liable person who submits their Income Tax or Corporation Tax Return but has not by then submitted their LPT Return or paid or entered into an arrangement to pay the tax will automatically incur a 10% surcharge on the Income Tax or Corporation Tax liability for the particular year of assessment or accounting period.  This will be the case even where the Income Tax or Corporation Tax return is itself filed on time.  Where the liable person subsequently submits the outstanding LPT Return, the surcharge will be capped at the amount of the LPT liability.  The timing in the case of Corporation Tax will vary, but for income tax the relevant date is 31 October 2013 for paper filers, and such later date as the Commissioners may announce as the filing date for e-filers, usually within the following two weeks.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am further advised that the normal compliance and debt recovery provisions apply to LPT as apply to the collection and recovery of other taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, any unpaid LPT will attach to the property, and the liable person will not be able to sell or transfer the property without paying the LPT, interest and penalties due.  The Revenue Commissioners are discussing the details of the processes with the Law Society, but it is envisaged that solicitors will be in a position to verify that LPT has been paid to enable them to properly complete conveyancing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100049#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2013","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100049#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[14070\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100049#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the consideration that he gave to gender proofing in the design of Budget 2013.","asker":"1028","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>With regard to budgetary matters, when focusing on the primary objectives of reducing the deficit and returning sustainability to the public finances, it has been of vital importance to the Government to spread the burden of the adjustments made in as fair and equitable a manner as possible, while also seeking to minimise their negative impact on economic growth.

As part of their terms of reference the Thornhill Group were to consider the design of a property tax to replace the household charge which is equitable and is informed by previous work and international experience. In designing the tax the Thornhill Group were guided by, inter alia, the principles of simplicity, transparency, equity and efficiency.    The Thornhill Group had due regard to issues such as ability to pay and considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship.  <\/p><p>  When considering reliefs, the Thornhill Group had regard to the following issues:<\/p><p> - The arrangements for payment of tax due arising from the ownership of properties should have regard to the ability of the owners to pay. <\/p><p> - Reliefs create costs which have to be paid for &ndash; either by taxpayers not benefiting from them, or by reductions in public expenditure.<\/p><p> - Reliefs should be designed to address clear economic and social policy needs.<\/p><p> - Considerable care would need to be taken in designing reliefs to ensure that the gains from the reliefs are targeted based on need and that there are not unintended and inequitably distributed gains.<\/p><p> - The LPT will not be assessed on incomes. <\/p><p>  The Thornhill Group favoured allowing voluntary deferrals rather than waivers. Deferrals focused on particular categories of householders can address cases where there is an inability to pay the LPT.  Income related waivers were considered to be an inefficient and costly method of targeting reliefs. They run the risk of creating inequities between taxpayers in broadly comparable situations.   Income related waivers also create poverty traps and employment traps resulting in work disincentives.  As a general principle, eligibility for deferral should be based on gross income. <\/p><p>  The Group also stated that, in current circumstances, an additional case can be made to target assistance on owner occupiers suffering severe financial stress as a result of housing mortgage commitments undertaken during the housing boom period, aggravated in some cases now by reductions in income.  The Government agreed with the recommendations of the Thornhill Group with regard to income related reliefs.  The Government decided, as a matter of policy, and in order to keep the rate of the tax low, that universal liability should apply, and that reliefs should be targeted at owner occupiers where there is inability to pay the tax.   <\/p><p>  The deferral thresholds in the Local Property Tax legislation were based on the recommendations of the Thornhill Group.  In recommending the thresholds the Group had regard to analysis it commissioned from the ESRI.  An income level of &euro;25,000 for joint and co-owners\/spouses\/civil partners\/cohabitees was recommended in order to enable most households in the lowest 40% of income levels to have the option of deferral.  This is considered appropriate, having regard to the findings in the ESRI study regarding potential impacts on households and having regard to the need for balance and equity in terms of the burden thereby imposed on those with higher (but still average or below average) incomes.  The ESRI report notes that increasing the income thresholds will have an impact on the rate of property tax that will be applied.  As the income threshold increases the rate would also be required to increase to achieve the same revenue yields.   <\/p><p>  The Government accepted the gross income thresholds for a full deferral, as recommended by the Thornhill Group, and adapted the recommended gross income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &euro;10,000 rather than &euro;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral. <\/p><p>  Accordingly, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT for individuals on low incomes in certain cases.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The gross income thresholds for a full deferral will be &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not &ldquo;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&rdquo; exceed these thresholds in that year.  <\/p><p>  An increased gross income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. <\/p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons\/civil partners\/cohabitants.  <\/p><p>  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&euro;25,000 single, &euro;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.<\/p><p>  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of c. 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.<\/p><p>  Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.  <\/p><p>  I appreciate that some property owners may find themselves unable to pay Local Property Tax but do not qualify for a deferral under the income thresholds.  For this reason, additional reliefs introduced in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provide that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100050#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100050#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[14084\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100050#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the fact that even after a 10% cut the salary of the CEO of Bank of Ireland will still be more than &euro;500,000.","asker":"984","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>When publishing the Review of Remuneration Practices and Frameworks at the Covered Institutions, on 12 March 2013, I indicated that the Government had formed the view that with the remaining covered institutions still incurring losses it was an inescapable conclusion that the cost base of the institutions needs to be reduced further.

As President of the ECOFIN Council I will continue to pursue the objectives set out in the ECOFIN work programme of the Irish Presidency of the European Union which were outlined to the ECOFIN Ministers on January 22nd last. This document set our ambitions on financial services dossiers (including the Banking Union proposals), economic governance and taxation measures.    In respect of work on the Banking Union proposals we have achieved support on a compromise package reached with the European Parliament on the Capital Requirements Directive IV.  Provisional agreement was recently reached with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The Bank Recovery and Resolution proposals are proceeding well in the Council and European Parliament. <\/p><p><br \/>  Making progress on the banking union proposals is of particular importance, both to Ireland and to the wider EU, as a way of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.   In so doing we will be fulfilling the goal set down by the Heads of State and Government on the 29 June 2012. <\/p><p>Agreement has been achieved with the Commission and European Parliament on the &quot;two pack&quot; of economic surveillance measures for the Eurozone and this reflects the final part of this set of agreed proposals on improved economic governance. <font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>The Irish Presidency has also worked to ensure the smooth operation<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  of the European Semester process across the ECOFIN Councils in January, February and March. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will appreciate that there is a need for the Presidency to remain impartial in order to be able to seek and achieve agreement with European partners on our Presidency agenda.<\/p><p><br \/>  That being said, I am happy to inform the Deputy that I am satisfied that there is clear awareness among my ECOFIN colleagues - and indeed across the whole EU - of the actions being taken by this Government to bring stability to our public finances and banking system and in that context an awareness of the economic sacrifices being made by the Irish people arising from these actions.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am also happy to inform the Deputy that there have been some recent positive developments, which will assist in our return to more normal economic and fiscal conditions. I refer in particular to: <\/p><p> - The agreement at<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  the March Eurogroup and Ecofin, to ask the Troika to come forward with a proposal for their best possible option for an adjustment of the maturities on the EFSF and EFSM loans for Ireland and Portugal.  In this regard it is important to note that, in advance of the Troika coming forward with proposals at the recent Eurogroup, Finance Ministers agreed to an adjustment of maturities on the loans of the EFSF.<\/p><p> - The enactment of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013 to provide for the winding up of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in an orderly and efficient manner, which resulted in the removal of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) from the Irish financial system.  <\/p><p><br \/>  - The ending of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme for new liabilities incurred after the 28th of March 2013. This marks an additional significant step in the normalization of our banking system and reduces substantially the associated contingent liability of the State.  <\/p><p><br \/>  - The successful conclusion of the ninth review mission of our EU-IMF Programme. In line with each of the previous quarterly reviews, Ireland has met all of its commitments and our continued strong programme implementation has been recognized by the Troika.<\/p><p><br \/>  - The successful issuance of treasury bills and longer term bonds by the NTMA in 2012 and 2013, together with the continued Irish yield contraction, which shows improved sentiment and reduced risk perception towards Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  These outcomes were achievable primarily as a result of the Government&#8217;s determined and steady management of Ireland&#8217;s economy, the goodwill and support of our EU partners and the EU Institutions and the improved perception of Ireland in financial markets.

In its latest assessment, the European Commission predicts subdued activity in the first half of 2013 followed by a gradual recovery in the second half of the year.    In relation to Ireland, figures published earlier today show GDP increased by 0.9 per cent last year, the second year of positive growth. While modest, the figures are encouraging.

They also stated   &ldquo;when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly&rdquo;. This commitment was reaffirmed by the European Council in December, which also mandated the completion of the operational framework for the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) direct banking recapitalisation facility in the first semester of 2013.  Work is continuing at technical, senior official and Ministerial levels to complete work on the ESM&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation facility by June of this year in accordance with the mandate of the European Council.  Once this operational framework is agreed, it envisaged that national procedures to approve the instrument would be completed by December 2013. On this basis, it will be December 2013, at the earliest, before the ESM&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation instrument is available.<\/p><p>  Earlier this week, provisional agreement was reached between the Irish Presidency on behalf of the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).  As I have noted above, the SSM will pave the way for the ESM to take on the direct recapitalisation of banks.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is that it is essential that the measures introduced for direct banking recapitalisation achieve the object of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks &ndash; as agreed by the HoSG on 29th June last year and confirmed last December.  On the question of whether I or my officials have had related discussions with the relevant Irish banks, as the instrument is still in the design phase such discussions would be premature at this juncture.

The Central Bank has informed me that it does not publish a geographical breakdown of these mortgage arrears figures.<\/p><p>  On 13 March 2013 the Central Bank announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks and proposed changes to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). This comprehensive approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer, conclude and implement sustainable solutions for their customers in mortgage arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards. The Central Bank is also proposing to update the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that, in determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the lender needs to evaluate both actual and prospective affordability for the borrower&rsquo;s affordability and the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility to minimise losses.  While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, there are some fundamental principles that must be respected in that context, including the following:<\/p><p> - The affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings; assumed prospective future increases in the debt servicing ability of the borrower must be credible and conservative.<\/p><p> - Lenders need to apply a realistic valuation of the borrower&rsquo;s assets, in particular their property.  This also applies to any assumption of potential asset price appreciation, as well as the estimated costs related to a potential foreclosure of property; and<\/p><p> - Lenders need to use an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender&rsquo;s cost of funds. <\/p><p>  The Central Bank will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications, and the durability of the restructured arrangements will be monitored and reported over time by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100051#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banks Recapitalisation","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100051#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[14063\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100051#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of meetings at which the issue of the retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks through the ESM has been discussed at ECOFIN or EuroGroup meetings.","asker":"1037","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>The European Stability Mechanism Bill was published in May 2012 and enacted in July 2012.

The first of these is EU2020, the EU&#8217;s growth strategy for the decade which aims to make the EU a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. This was followed by the European Semester to which was added the Euro Plus Pact and the so-called &#8216;six-pack&#8217; which came into effect on 13 December 2011. The &#8216;six-pack&#8217; is the name given to a legislative package, comprising five regulations and one directive, designed to reform and strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and to introduce new macroeconomic surveillance.<\/p><p><br \/>  The proposed &#8216;two-pack&#8217; - on which political agreement has recently been reached at EU level -<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font> is a further step in this process and is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the &#8216;six-pack&#8217;. It will be<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>applicable to euro area Member States only. The first proposed regulation in the two-pack relates to &#8216;the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits&#8217;. The second proposed regulation under the two-pack is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance and sets out explicit rules for both enhanced surveillance and post-programme surveillance.  As part of this proposed regulation, a post-programme surveillance process will be put in place and maintained for a Member State until the balance outstanding under EU-sourced financial assistance falls below 25% of the total. This covers all EU funding sources, including bilateral loans.  Under the terms of this draft regulation, the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under post-programme surveillance to assess its economic, fiscal and financial situation.<\/p><p><br \/>  I should add that under the new governance rules of the EU and in particular the Euro area, a greater degree of oversight will be required for all participating Member States in the future in any event.  Taking account of lessons of the recent economic and financial crisis, this should underpin a stronger Euro zone and be of benefit to all.<\/p><p><br \/>  Given that EU Finance Ministers at Eurogroup and ECOFIN on 4\/5 March 2013 discussed an adjustment of the maturities on the EFSF and EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal it is not possible at this time to give the duration of post programme surveillance.

In the case of the EFSM loans, this will require discussion and agreement of the EU 27 Finance Ministers, and I expect this matter will be discussed by them in the coming weeks.  However, until a final decision by Ministers on the length of any maturity adjustment is taken, and the details of its implementation are known, it will not be possible to assess the impact of such changes on the duration of the enhanced surveillance procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100051#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100051#WRE01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100051#WRE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[14393\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100051#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to review Ireland's diplomatic and consular representation in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network includes 56 Embassies, 7 multilateral Missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices overseas.

The exemption will then apply for a temporary period of approximately three years, starting with the first liability date occurring after a certificate has been issued.  If a certificate has not been issued before the first or second liability dates of 1 May 2013 and 1 November 2013, a liable person will have the option, where the certificate is issued on or before 31 December 2013, to retrospectively elect for one or other of those dates to be the first liability date of the exemption period.  If a liable person makes such an election on or before 31 January 2014, any LPT that has already been paid in respect of one or both of those liability dates (depending on which date is selected) will then be repaid to the liable person by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100052#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100052#WRF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[14605\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100052#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will indicate where accountability lies for issues regarding the Revenue Commissioners and the non-compliance by private companies in relation to VAT in view of circumstances (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that tax administration in Ireland operates under a code of Self-Assessment where tax entities are obliged by law to declare and pay the correct tax on a timely basis.

In common with all State bodies, the Revenue Commissioners are subject to audit and examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and examination by the Public Accounts Committee.

A condition that must be met for this exemption to apply is that both the property that is occupied by the relative(s) of the owner of that property, and the property that owner occupies as his or her sole or main residence, must be situated on the same property or within two kilometres of each other.

It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced. For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and this year&#8217;s Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Capital Allowance Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.<\/p><p><b>Index of Tables and Notes<\/b><\/p><p>a) Note on the Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009 <\/p><p>b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009.

A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax. An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.<\/p><p><br \/>  The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.<\/p><p><br \/>  In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &#8220;costs&#8221; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &#8220;loss of tax revenue&#8221; on profits. To compute such &#8220;loss&#8221;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).<\/p><p><br \/>  The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with &#8364;1,000 gross trading profits, &#8364;1,000 capital allowances and &#8364;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &#8364;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &#8364;1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.<\/p><p><br \/>  The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.<\/p><p><br \/>  Apart from the artists' exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007.

They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.\r\n\r\n(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.\r\n\r\n(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.\r\n\r\n(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a &#8220;net pay&#8221; basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.\r\n\r\n(6) See the following note on &#8220;Green Paper on Pensions&#8221; for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures .\r\n\r\n(7) &#8220;Other&#8221; relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership .\r\n\r\n(8) The income on which the cost of exemption from income tax for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. is based includes dividend income on which income tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies. Information is not available about other income received gross.\r\n\r\n(9) The cost figures for relief for certain Sports Persons are based on income tax self assessment returns and for donations to Approved Sports Bodies are based on income tax and corporation tax self assessment returns.\r\n\r\n(10) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.\r\n\r\n(11) The costs and numbers for the Exemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments are based on external data. From 2009 the &#8220;numbers&#8221; indicate the numbers of claims received in the year and not the numbers of claims approved.\r\n\r\n(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2008 and 2009.\r\n\r\n(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with &#8220;unused capital allowances&#8221;, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company&#8217;s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that &#8364;3587 million and &#8364;5373 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2008 and 2009 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.\r\n\r\n(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2008 and 2009 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.\r\n\r\n(15) The cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be understated by at least &#8364;100m.\r\n\r\n(16) The costs shown for R&amp;D are for claims for R&amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2008 and 2009. However, the cost for 2009 includes the amount of credit allowed against 2009 tax together with the amount offset against tax of previous accounting periods and as payable credits.\r\n\r\nd) Note on Green Paper on Pensions - Review of estimates of cost\r\n\r\n  As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n  The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2008 and 2009 are included in table IT6.\r\n\r\n  The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years PRIOR TO 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable. further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions which is available at www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie.\r\n\r\ne) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009\r\n\r\n  Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax - uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2008 and 2009 tax returns\r\n\r\n  Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns. This information, derived from changes introduced by the Revenue Commissioners to income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2008 and 2009, is set out in the following tables.\r\n\r\n  The figures shown include the amounts claimed in the year but exclude amounts carried forward into the year either as losses or capital allowances, and include any amounts of unused losses and\/or capital allowances which will be carried forward to subsequent years.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":211,"content":"<p>Table<\/p><p>Tax Incentive\/Income Exemption 2008Amount ClaimedAssumed maximum tax cost &#8364;mNumber of claimants&#8364;m&#8364;mUrban renewal230.887.03,367Town Renewal61.624.2998Seaside Resorts16.16.41,091Rural Renewal88.435.72,803Multi-storey car parks16.86.6134Living Over the shop6.42.681Enterprise Areas6.32.5138Park and Ride1.80.721Holiday Cottages36.914.8844Hotels305.5116.41,996Nursing Homes48.419.8734Housing for the Elderly\/infirm7.43.0179Hostels1.680.6922Guest Houses0.290.1210Convalescent Homes1.40.532Qualifying Private Hospitals30.212.3342Qualifying sports injury clinics4.11.760Buildings Used for certain child care purposes30.312.2519Qualifying Mental Health Centres0.10.03Student Accommodation60.023.5814Caravan Camps1.50.610Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure1.80.712Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.00.010Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions92.315.1192Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands51.013.62,492Exempt Patents (Section 234, TCA 1997)198.351.71,209Totals1,299.2452.618,111<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":212,"content":"<p>Table<\/p><p>Tax Incentive\/Income Exemption 2009Amount ClaimedAssumed maximum tax cost &#8364;mNumber of claimants&#8364;m&#8364;mUrban renewal233.893.13410Town Renewal45.418.31,001Seaside Resorts13.35.3875Rural Renewal70.028.02,653Multi-storey car parks13.25.2130Living Over the shop4.11.766Enterprise Areas5.42.1118Park and Ride2.00.820Holiday Cottages34.713.9786Hotels263.2102.11,906Nursing Homes54.421.6750Housing for the Elderly\/infirm6.82.8145Hostels0.730.314Guest Houses0.240.18Convalescent Homes1.30.528Qualifying Private Hospitals30.512.5346Qualifying sports injury clinics3.61.567Buildings Used for certain child care purposes30.812.5527Qualifying Mental Health Centres0.10.01Student Accommodation48.319.1751Caravan Camps0.60.22Mid Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure0.60.22Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.00.05Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions2.00.432Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands48.214.43,570Exempt Patents (section 234, TCA 1997)260.771.71,268Other52.619.5635Totals1,226.6447.819,116<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":213,"content":"<p>These figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006 and which took effect from 1 January 2007.The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.\r\n\r\nAs the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and last year&#8217;s Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- The figures shown relate to the various reliefs\/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2008 and 2009 form 11 and CT1.\r\n\r\n- There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns.

In accordance with this objective a number of sectoral measures were introduced to support employment creation as part of Budget 2012, targeting job-rich sectors such as agriculture and construction.<\/p><p>  I would point out that up-to-date employment data are presented in net terms and timely information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available. This unfortunately makes it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative.<\/p><p>  Bearing that in mind, recent signs from the labour market have tended towards the positive and sectors targeted by the Government are showing tentative signs of stabilisation. For instance, employment (seasonally-adjusted) increased over each of the last two quarters of 2012, while the standardised unemployment rate based on the Live Register was at 14.1 per cent in February, down from 15.0 per cent a year earlier.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that job creation measures are not limited to those contained in the Budget. For instance, research carried out by my Department and published with the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement (November 2012), suggests that the temporary reduction in VAT for the tourism sector, introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative, has had a positive impact on employment growth in this sector.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, each year my Department publishes the White Paper, detailing pre-Budget estimates of the State&rsquo;s fiscal position for the forthcoming year assuming no additional policy measures. It is worth noting that without further consolidation Ireland&rsquo;s General Government Balance, as a percentage of GDP, was projected to remain in double digit figures for 2012, at 10.0 per cent. This would have exceeded the deficit target of 8.6 per cent set under the EU-IMF Programme and is contrasted with an 8.2 per cent projected outturn for last year in the most recent forecasts.<\/p><p>  The Government acknowledges that the necessary consolidation can have a negative short-run impact on economic output; however, over the medium term there can be positive effects such as increased confidence and a reduction in the risk premium as the deficit is reduced and debt is put on a declining path.

This means that a substantial part of fiscal consolidation leaks out of the economy in the form of lower imports.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to monitor high-frequency data to assess the ongoing impact of these consolidation measures on macroeconomic outturn.<\/p><p>  Finally, I would point out that figures published this morning show that GDP increased by 0.9 per cent last year, with domestic demand stabilising over the course of the year.

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.

The decision taken has been not to use the IVR systems because the nature of the work does not lend itself well to an IVR-based approach.  Bodies under the aegis of my Department have provided me with the following information.<\/p><p><b><i>Office of the Revenue Commissioners<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have successfully deployed a large number of interactive voice recognition (IVR) systems within their operations.  In particular, an IVR system was put in place for Revenue&#8217;s PAYE 1890 telephone service as part of a comprehensive upgrade implemented over the period 2004\/2005.  The PAYE 1890 service has the highest volume of telephone contacts handled by Revenue and in 2011 some 1.23 million calls were answered on the service.  Shortly after the PAYE 1890 deployment, the Collector General&#8217;s 1890 telephone system was also re-configured with a similar IVR system to PAYE.  Some 228,000 calls were handled through the Collector General&#8217;s 1890 telephone service in 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  The particular IVR system deployed by Revenue on its PAYE and Collector General&#8217;s telephone services is a very sophisticated system in that, in the first instance, a caller is asked to speak their PPS Number or Business Number into the IVR which then captures the number.  By collecting the caller&#8217;s PPS or Business Number, the call can be routed to the correct Division directly and the Revenue person handling the call is presented on their computer screen with key tax and other information about the caller at the same time that the call is passed to them to answer.  The voice capture technology behind the system is highly sophisticated as it manages to gather both the numeric and alpha characters that constitute PPS and Business Numbers within the one message string.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am further advised that an additional feature of this IVR system is that it facilitates a range of self-service options that the caller can use to get certain services without human intervention, including for example a facility to request the most popular PAYE forms and leaflets or, to request a statement of account in the case of a business.  In these cases, the form or statement of account requested is posted to the address associated with the PPS or Business Number that has been collected from the caller via the voice recognition system.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised that Revenue is constantly reviewing developments with regard to IVR systems and other trends in telecommunications with the objective of making the taxpayer&#8217;s experience with their telephone services as smooth and efficient as possible and, in seeking to optimise any process efficiencies.  In that regard, I understand that the various services and options available to callers that underpin the PAYE 1890 IVR system were re-vamped during 2012 and have been successfully implemented.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the past four to five years, IVR systems have also been implemented at telephone switch level in a number of Revenue offices around the country.  While the PPS number capture is not a feature of these facilities, they provide callers with a list of options to choose from and the call is directed to the desk of a Revenue staff member who will have the specific knowledge required to deal with the particular query.  In these offices, because calls are routed directly to staff members, a switch operator is not required to manage the flow of calls.  An IVR system has recently been deployed on Revenue&#8217;s Local Property Tax Helpline, and, as a matter of policy, Revenue will deploy IVR in its customer facing telephone systems where opportunities arise.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since their major IVR developments have been in place for a number of years, they are not in position to provide the information sought in relation to staff and salary cost savings.  However, the Commissioners are satisfied that savings have been achieved from the use of IVR systems and they have also facilitated significant process efficiencies<\/p><p><b><i>ReBo (Credit Union Restructuring Board)<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The Credit Union Restructuring Board have advised me that voice response systems are available on their phone systems, and that the salary costs savings have not been assessed.<\/p><p><b><i>National Treasury Management Agency<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The phone system currently in operation within the NTMA has the ability to provide voice activated automation.

As the Deputy is aware Ireland&#8217;s youth unemployment rate is unacceptably high.  In an effort to reduce this figure (along with Ireland&#8217;s overall unemployment rate) we are driving cross Government initiatives as outlined in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs.<\/p><p><br \/>  From my Department&#8217;s perspective, the material related to Access to Finance is of particular importance.  SME&#8217;s will be a key driver of growth and job creation across the country and access to credit and financing is essential for them to trade, to grow and to create jobs.  Through intensive engagement with SMEs and the banks we have identified a range of measures that tackle the challenges related to SME credit.<\/p><p><br \/>  By end 2013, new Government schemes totalling almost &#8364;2.5 billion in new lending to business will be in place: &#8364;850 million of the National Pension Reserve Fund for the SME sector, &#8364;700 million seed and venture capital scheme, &#8364;450 million credit guarantee scheme, &#8364;225 million development capital scheme, &#8364;120 million second call under Innovation Fund Ireland, &#8364;90 million microfinance scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Furthermore, the plan put in place new structures to better monitor bank lending to business: &#8364;4 billion in lending to businesses by each of the pillar banks (AIB &amp; BoI), extra staff for the Credit Review Office, which overturns over half of the bank refusal decisions which are appealed to it, more comprehensive progress reports on SME lending by banks to my Department.  I have asked one of the public interest directors in each of the pillar banks to have specific reporting responsibility on SME lending.  As part of Budget 2013, I announced a 10 point plan for SMEs which includes several measures aimed at improving their credit situation. <\/p><p><br \/>  Businesses also need greater choice in sourcing finance, and should be able to rely, not only on conventional loans from banks, but on other, often non-bank funding sources.  My officials are using the opportunity of the Irish Presidency to actively investigate non-bank funding sources with our European colleagues and I have put this issue on the Agenda for the informal Ecofin that will take place in Dublin in April. <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to targeting improvements in credit conditions, my Department is also actively involved in assisting job growth through initiatives in the Construction, Agri-Food, Financial Services, Tourism and Aviation sectors.  All of these initiatives will support job creation and offer opportunities for young people seeking employment.<\/p><p><br \/>  On Thursday, 7 March, the Department of Finance published its Review of 2012.

There is also an exemption from local property tax up to the end of 2016 where a new or previously unoccupied home is purchased from a builder or developer between 1 January 2013 and 31 October 2016.  These measures should provide assistance to first time buyers following the ending of mortgage interest relief from income tax.<\/p><p>  Given the current fragile state of the public finances, I am not in position to introduce new supports for first time buyers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100054#WRH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100054#WRH01150"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[14555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100054#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason he intends targeting rank-and-file bank workers' pay and not senior management with disproportionately high salaries and in receipt of bonuses; the way he justifies the workers' cuts if the Mercer Report suggests these cuts would only yield savings of &euro;70 million across all three remaining State-supported institutions while AIB reports a &euro;1.2bn loss for the first half of 2012, Permanent TSB reporting a loss of &euro;0.5bn for the first half of 2012, and Bank of Ireland reporting preliminary annual losses for 2012 of &euro;1.8bn; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the cuts would have little effect on profitability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[14563\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100054#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a submission (details supplied) regarding payroll cuts; the actions he will take to address the concerns raised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[14583\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100054#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding payroll cuts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[14603\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100054#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding payroll cuts","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 89, 100 and 101 together.<\/p><p>  When publishing the Review of Remuneration Practices and Frameworks at the Covered Institutions, on 12 March 2013, I indicated that the Government had formed the view that with the remaining covered institutions still incurring losses it was an inescapable conclusion that the cost base of the institutions needs to be reduced further.  This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains. <\/p><p>  This point is reinforced in the correspondence supplied by the Deputies where it is asserted that even a target reduction of 6% to 10% in remuneration will not by itself impact significantly on losses now occurring at the covered institutions.  If appropriate action is not taken on this front in a timely manner then bank workers will be facing much more unpalatable measures than now proposed.  Tackling the cost base is of course only one of many goals that need to be achieved but combined with other measures will deliver the required results. <\/p><p>  I would point out in this context that redundancies at the covered institutions have been achieved to date on a voluntary basis on negotiated terms.

However, it can never be forgotten by management and employees of these banks &ndash; both past and present &ndash; that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived and that this needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.

Those criteria have not changed.  It is clear is that the ECB will decide on the application of OMTs in any particular circumstance to the extent that they are warranted from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is fully respected, and terminate them once their objectives are achieved or when there is non-compliance with the macroeconomic adjustment or precautionary programme.  It is also clear that the ECB's Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMTs, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  I believe the ECB&rsquo;s announcement regarding its OMT programme is a significant development and is viewed as such by the financial markets.  We are in the final year of our EU-IMF programme.  Our focus is firmly fixed on a successful and durable exit from the programme.  The recent highly successful sale of long-term bonds by the NTMA is another very significant step in this process.  We continue to assess a number of options in this regard.

Borrowings of up to three times a country's IMF quota are subject to the basic rate of charge.  Borrowings above three times quota attract a surcharge of 200 basis points which is in addition to the 100 basis points margin which forms part of the basic rate of charge.

The new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.  The Central Bank is proposing to update the CCMA so it continues to provide protection to customers who co-operate with their banks while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.  The CCMA prevents a lender from requiring a principal private residence borrower in mortgage arrears to change from an existing tracker to another rate as part of any alternative repayment arrangement offered.  However, as part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s review of the CCMA, it is considering whether there is merit in allowing a lender to move a borrower in arrears off a tracker rate, where the lender has offered an alternative arrangement which is advantageous to the borrower in the long term.  The purpose of the consultation process that is under way is to gather views on such a proposal to determine if a change is required and warranted.  On the issue of advice more generally, as the Deputy is aware as part of the Government&rsquo;s mortgage advisory service which has been developed under the guidance of the Department of Social Protection, mortgage holders who have been presented with long-term mortgage resolution proposals by lenders can avail of independent one-to-one advice on those proposals.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland.  I encourage borrowers who have been offered long-term forbearance options by their lender to avail of this free service.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that, in determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the lender needs to evaluate both actual and prospective affordability for the borrower and the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility to minimise losses.  While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, some fundamental principles must be respected.  For example, the affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings.  Assumed prospective future increases in the debt servicing ability of the borrower must be credible and conservative.  Lenders need to apply a realistic valuation of the borrower&rsquo;s assets, in particular their property.  This also applies to any assumption of potential asset price appreciation, as well as the estimated costs related to a potential foreclosure of property.  Lenders need to use an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender&rsquo;s cost of funds.  The Central Bank has advised that it will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100055#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100055#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[14581\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100055#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider Mandate's call for a deferral of the property tax in order to protect the retail industry, protect homeowners in distress, and consumer spending; if he will consider introducing alternative revenue raising measures that will be less damaging to the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":282,"content":"<p>The introduction of the Local Property Tax will deliver significant economic and fiscal reform by broadening the revenue base to pay for vital public services in a manner that does not directly impact on employment.

Those whose income is &euro;10,000 above these thresholds are eligible for a partial deferral of their LPT liability.  These thresholds can also be increased by 80% of any mortgage interest payable up to the end of 2017.  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  In all cases, interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum.  The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  New provisions in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provide that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for those who do not qualify for deferral of the tax, a number of different payment options have been put in place to assist people in meeting their Local Property Tax (LPT) obligations, including the facility to pay by cash.  This will allow liable persons to pay their LPT liability in full or to pay the tax for 2013 in equal instalments over the period 1 July 2013 to the end of December 2013.  Revenue's strategy in this regard is to ensure taxpayers have a choice of payment options available to them from which they can choose the method which is most suited to their individual circumstances.  I am satisfied that the provisions in the legislation with regard to deferral of liability are suitably targeted at cases of need, and that the tax itself will neither adversely impact on employment nor hinder economic growth in the economy.  Accordingly, I am not considering a postponement of the introduction of the tax at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100055#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":284,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 100 and 101 answered with Question No. 88.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100056#WRK00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100056#WRK00250"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[14373\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100056#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the frequency with which circulars drafted within his Department are reviewed; if there is any obligation, mandatory or otherwise, for circulars to be reviewed and at what interval; if he will consider introducing a review system similar to that which exists in the Department of Health where all circulars have to be reviewed every two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>Circulars issued by my Department are reviewed in the context of changes to the administration of and\/or policies governing the particular subject, programme or scheme rather than on a fixed period review.

I share the concerns of the young people in relation to the creation of jobs. Last year, the Government published \"Pathways to Work\".  This will involve radical reform and restructuring of the Further Education and Training Sector and the establishment of SOLAS which is currently underway.<\/p><p>  In 2011, the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy was published.  The recommendations in the Strategy are currently being implemented. Last October, I published the Framework for the Junior Cycle.  When the Framework is implemented it should address many of the concerns of the young people about their junior cycle education and it should become more &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.  In the new Framework, literacy and numeracy skills are again highlighted but so too are six other skills: Managing myself; staying well; communicating; being creative; working with others and also managing information and thinking.  This approach to the learning experience of students in junior cycle should get away from the current focus on a narrow set of skills which the report criticises and it should influence practices in senior cycle.<\/p><p>  The Framework is underpinned by 8 Principles &ndash; including Wellbeing; Quality; Creativity and Innovation; Choice and Flexibility: Engagement and Participation; Inclusive Education; Continuity and Development and also Learning to Learn.  These  principles should be the enablers for the delivery of a broader education.<\/p><p>  The learning at the core of the junior cycle is described through 24 statements of learning.  These, when implemented, will respond directly to many of the comments of the young people including the need for the students to experience and value &quot;what it means to be an active citizen, with rights and responsibilities in local and wider contexts&quot; and to value &quot;local, national and international heritage, understand the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change&quot;.<\/p><p>  I am, over the next 7 years, phasing out the State Junior Certificate examination and replacing it with a school based approach to assessment.  The Junior Certificate is no longer, for the vast majority of students, a high stakes examination.  Instead, at the end of junior cycle, there will be a school report. It will include a School Certificate which will provide information on a student's achievement in subjects and short courses but, in addition, the School Certificate will be accompanied by an achievement profile which will provide a formal opportunity to acknowledge important achievements by students e.g in volunteering, in sport, debating.<\/p><p>  Irish is a very important part of my remit and I am particularly aware of the recommendations in the 20 Year Strategy for Irish.  I am committed to implementing the recommendations in the Strategy in accordance with the resources available.<\/p><p>  My Department along with the NCCA, SEC and HEA are examining issues relating to the transition from second level to higher education.  This is as a follow up to the recommendations of a joint conference organised by the NCCA and HEA in September 2011 and the report which emanated from their conference.<\/p><p>  To address issues relating to access to third level education, which were highlighted by the young people, I would like to refer to the HEA publication of January 2010 &quot;Hidden Disadvantage?  A study on the Low Participation in Higher Education by the Non- Manual Group&quot;.  The research for the report was carried out by the ESRI and its recommendations continue to inform policy.<\/p><p>  A mid-term review of Ireland's National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008-2013 has been carried out and identifies that, despite difficult circumstances, progress has been made in this area.  Work has now commenced on the development of the next national access plan for 2014 onwards.  A key component of the new plan will be consideration of what targets and actions are needed so that the focus will continue on increasing the participation of under-represented and disadvantaged groups in higher education.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the terms of my Department's Free Fee Initiative, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution.  The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU\/EEA\/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU\/EEA\/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  The Higher Education Authority (HEA) is undertaking a study on the sustainability of the current funding system for higher education.  This study was initiated at my request and an initial report has been published. This report makes it clear that immediate work is required to prepare for a longer term approach to a system that can be maintained through a sustainable funding base which will be able to address the continual expansion of the sector while protecting quality of education.  The HEA is continuing its work in this area and I will be advised further as this work progresses.  The report will help inform the decision-making as to the future funding of the sector.<\/p><p>  The voice and views of the partners are very important as I consider policy and the young person's voice is particularly important.  I welcome the views of students when there are school evaluations along with, for example, the views of the Irish Second-Level Students' Union.  The &quot;Being Young and Irish&quot; report provides another very important and rich perspective not only for my continued consideration but also for a wider audience.  My overall aim is to support the quality of our students' learning and  to improve their educational outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Leaving Certificate Centres","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01050"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[14540\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will consider designating Ballyfermot College of Further Education, Dublin, an approved third level institution for the purposes of the student grant where it is delivering an honours bachelor degree which is accredited by a university which offers courses which qualify for student grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that Ballyfermot College of Further Education (BCFE) is an approved Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) centre which is managed and funded by City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee (CDVEC) from funding provided by my Department.

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or through a combination of these.  Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.<\/p><p>  However my Department is mindful that greater clarity would be useful for schools and parents and accordingly my Department is currently in the process of preparing a comprehensive statement of existing policy within the boundaries of one document.  Naturally the new policy statement will not be exclusive.  Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time.  Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.<\/p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs.  In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.<\/p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required.  Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.<\/p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children.  Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children.  Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased.  Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.<\/p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act.  While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.<\/p><p>  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.  My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01450"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[14556\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the design team will be appointed for the construction of a permanent school building (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>The school project referred to by the Deputy is included in the 5 year capital programme and is scheduled to progress to construction in 2014\/15.<\/p><p>  The OPW had agreed to deliver a number of schools including the school referred to by the Deputy and the process of consultation with the relevant stakeholders on the timeframe for the delivery of these schools will commence shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Discipline","counter":320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01650"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[14557\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the measures he is taking to ensure that incidents such as those that occurred on FACEBOOK, affecting a member of teaching staff in a school (details supplied), in County Limerick do not recur; if he will financially support schools in this type of situation in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>In general , incidents, of the type referred to by the Deputy, are best dealt with in accordance with a school's code of behaviour and it is therefore important that a school's code of behaviour makes very clear the standards expected of pupils, including those relating to respecting school staff, and the actions that will be taken in the event of any breaches of the code.<\/p><p>  The Education Welfare Act 2000 requires all schools to have in place a Code of Behaviour.  The Act also requires that a school Code of Behaviour shall specify the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school, the measures that may be taken when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards and the procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school concerned.<\/p><p>  A school's code of behaviour must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB guidelines  make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that on 29th of January last, Minister Fitzgerald and I published the Action Plan on Bullying which sets out twelve actions to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools.

The Action Plan on Bullying states that children and young people who engage in bullying behaviour do not always intend to bully or recognise the potential negative impact of their words and actions on others.  Therefore, central to promoting safer and appropriate use of the  internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyber bullying incidents. Several actions in the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas.<\/p><p>  Work will continue on implementing the Action Plan on Bullying in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01850"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[14558\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the design team will be appointed for a school (details supplied) in view of the fact that the new school build is scheduled to start by 2014\/15; the reasons for the delay and the action being taken to resolve it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>The school project referred to by the Deputy is included in the 5 year capital programme and is scheduled to progress to construction in 2014\/15.<\/p><p>  The OPW had agreed to deliver a number of schools including the school referred to by the Deputy and the process of consultation with the relevant stakeholders on the timeframe for the delivery of these schools will commence shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Licence Sale","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL02050"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[14376\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100057#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will grant National Lottery sale agency status to persons (details supplied) in County Westmeath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>While I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, have overall responsibility for the National Lottery, the appointment of Lottery agents is a matter for the National Lottery Company.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 87,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &#8364;403 million for 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Department funds a significant proportion of private sector rented accommodation. Accordingly, it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in any way. The purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.<\/p><p><br \/>  The maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013. These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market. Approximately 56,600 rent supplement claims have been awarded since January 2012, showing that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.  <\/p><p>The focus of the review was primarily based on ensuring an adequate level of housing stock is available, using the 40th percentile as the basis for establishing rent limits. The Department used publicly available data sources to ascertain both the market trends and the current asking prices for one, two and three bedroom properties nationally. The following data sources were used:<\/p><p>1. Daft.ie Rental Market Reports;<\/p><p>2. Leading websites advertising properties for rent;<\/p><p>3. CSO Rental Indices;<\/p><p>4. Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Databases<\/p><p>A snapshot of the PRTB&#8217;s database which stores all annual rental values and relevant addresses.<\/p><p>In County Kildare property availability at 40% of the market was examined for areas containing the main population centres (Celbridge, Kilcock, Naas,Newbridge,Clane, Kilcullen, Kildare, Maynooth, Monasterevin, Sallins and Straffan) and also for the whole county.  <\/p><p>When answering PQ no 117 of 5 March 2013, the number of rent supplement recipients in the main North Kildare population centres of Celbridge, Kilcock, Leixlip and Maynooth was used.

The Department has, however, been conscious of rising costs and emerging alternatives for some time and is actively planning the migration of Lo-call numbers to the 0761 range provided to us by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   Some infrastructure upgrades are required to ensure that new numbers can be accommodated on the telephone network in a seamless integration.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department is also integrating former FAS and CWS offices into its voice and data network and the new design has to take account of these changed circumstances. <\/p><p>  I am mindful, at all times, of the importance of the telephone to large numbers of the Department&rsquo;s customers for whom the telephone is the preferred method of communication. Any changes to long-established and well publicised numbers have to be carefully managed and announced far in advance of implementation.  I also need to ensure that stocks of published information are run down before being reprinted with new numbers.  <\/p><p>  The Department implemented Interactive Voice Response (IVR) solutions along with Lo-call numbers.  No staff or salary savings accrued at that time as the Locall numbers were considered to have attracted additional traffic.  There is a notional saving in that no additional telephonists were required to deal with the extra calls but an amount has never been calculated and may not be meaningful after this number of years where the higher levels of traffic are now the norm. IVRs still require a staff engagement to deal with callers who cannot navigate through the menus or take the option to go to the telephonist.<\/p><p>  My department is fully committed to shared services and minimising costs where possible and all related proposals are welcomed.

The report found that young people are understandably concerned about the prospects for graduate employment.  The transition from education to work can be very difficult for all young people.  International studies show that many young people have to face unemployment for several months, if not years, before finding their first job after leaving education. Although a period of transition is normal, a slow or difficult transition to the labour market can have a lasting impact on an individual&rsquo;s career and future income. Of particular concern is that two out of every five young unemployed people are out of work for more than one year. Difficulties in the transition to working life tend to be more acute for those who have left education with few or no qualifications.<\/p><p>  In this context, it is a welcome development that the most recent official labour market figures published by the CSO indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier. It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers. However, notwithstanding the recent decline, the level of youth unemployment is still unacceptably high.<\/p><p>  I note that the report emphasises the importance of stimulating the economy to foster jobs for young people.  Indeed, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth, and past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.<\/p><p>  However, until the economy fully recovers the Government also recognises the need for interim measures.  In this context, I am aware that feedback contained in the report suggests that young people perceive that labour market activation programmes are not for new graduates. The Government&rsquo;s main strategy for helping the unemployed into employment - Pathways to Work - has specific targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.<\/p><p>  This involves focusing resources on those (including young people) who are already out of work for some time, or who are clearly at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are relevant to young people. As a result, many young people, including graduates, are availing of the State&rsquo;s activation programmes. <\/p><p>  Long-term unemployed youth will benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person off the Live Register. Given that young people normally benefit most when employers start hiring, they are likely to be particular beneficiaries of this initiative.<\/p><p>  MOMENTUM, a new initiative launched in 2013, has a specific youth component. MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 jobseekers (who are unemployed for 12 months or more) to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. MOMENTUM consists of 4 themes, of which theme 4 is dedicated to under 25s. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year. The qualifying period for BTEA is 3 months on the live register for second-level courses and 9 months on the live register for third-level courses.<\/p><p>  While these programmes focus on the longer term unemployed, assistance is also provided at earlier stages of job-search for those who have become unemployed either through losing a job or on leaving education.<\/p><p>  In terms of job-search assistance, some 24,500 young people registered with Employment Services in 2012, representing 35% of all registrants. About one in six of these young people seeking job-search assistance had further or higher education qualifications. In 2012, there were some 33,000 referrals of persons aged under 25 to the Department&rsquo;s activation services, affecting approximately 26,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred, 68% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year. <\/p><p>  There are a number of schemes\/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 was 2,700. These programmes may be undertaken after three months&rsquo; unsuccessful job search.<\/p><p>  Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012 (excluding apprenticeships and evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&rsquo; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes. Training courses relevant to the individual job-seeker&rsquo;s needs are available to all young unemployed.<\/p><p>  The European Commission recently proposed a Council Recommendation on a European-wide approach to a &ldquo;Youth Guarantee&rdquo;. The Council Recommendation -- which received political agreement from EU employment ministers last month -- recommends that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. In advance of the anticipated adoption of the Recommendation, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland, including measures specifically aimed at graduates, to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. <\/p><p>  Finally, the report refers to young people&rsquo;s perception of social welfare and the fairness of its distribution. I would note that the main measure of the fairness of social welfare transfers is the extent to which they impact on poverty, and that the Irish system performs relatively well in this regard. In 2011, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 40 per cent to 16 per cent. This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 60 per cent. Though a slight dis-improvement on the 2010 figure of 62.4 per cent, the 60 per cent figure compares very favourably with the 2005 rate of 42 per cent, an improvement of 18 percentage points.  The Irish &ldquo;poverty reduction&rdquo; rate is amongst the highest in the EU, where the average is 35 per cent; in other member states most affected by the crisis, the rate is less than 30 per cent. <\/p><p>  These data show the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable and should alleviate concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the social welfare system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100060#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Meals Programme","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100060#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[14545\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100060#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to adjust the cap on school funding under the schools meals programme taking note of increased school enrolments as in a school (details supplied) in Dublin 11; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1023","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>The school meals programme operated by the Department provides funding towards the provision of food services for disadvantaged children through two schemes.

As already indicated 40% renewable generation of electricity is an important element of the overall 15% target.<font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>  Articles 6-12 of the Renewable Energy Directive provide that where a Member State falls short of its target, it will have to purchase renewable energy credits (known as &#8220;statistical transfer&#8221;) from other Member States that have exceeded their target, at an as yet, unknown price.  Accordingly, in this scenario, costs associated with renewable energy development will still be incurred, without the benefits of development. <\/p><p>In terms of the local communities in which wind-farming takes place, the economic benefits can potentially include construction, maintenance and component manufacturing employment. This latter opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies. There is also a potential flow of income to local economies in terms of rates, rent to land owners and local community funds.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100061#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology Issues","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100061#WRP01150"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[14480\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100061#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress made within his Department on phasing out the use of LoCall 1890 numbers that can be extremely expensive when dialled from mobile phones and introducing 076 number, which generally included in tariff bundles provided by most mobile network operators and are charged at the same rate as national calls, in view of the fact that the number of mobile phones exceed the number of landlines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":436,"content":"<p>My Department uses both 1890 lo-call number and national number for members of the public.<\/p><p>  The use of a lo-call number affords considerable savings to people who do not have access to free national call services.

In pursuit of these objects RT&Eacute; and TG4 are charged, inter alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements, which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;.  RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act.  The extent to which the commitments entered into by our two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).<\/p><p>  Radio and television services, additional to those provided by the national public service broadcasters are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body.  Matters in relation to Irish music content on commercial radio are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and commercial radio operators.  In submitting their initial licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments, for instance, in regard to the playing of Irish music.  If they are successful, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of their actual licence.<\/p><p>  This policy approach is seen as appropriate in that it deals with the differing requirements of commercial and public service broadcasting. In relation to commercial broadcasters, it is seen as an effective means of leveraging public service type commitments that takes full account of the specific broadcaster&rsquo;s business proposal.  As for public service broadcasters, it provides an iterative approach that is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the changing needs of Irish society continue to be addressed.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of quotas, I understand that during the mid-nineties, the Regulator attempted to introduce a policy whereby 30% of music played by commercial radio stations would be by Irish artists.  The measure was deemed to be in breach of EU regulations on the grounds that it would discriminate against other European artists and would, therefore, be contrary to European law.<\/p><p>  Such a measure could only be supported if linked to a readily identifiable cultural criterion (Irish language, for example), as is the case in France and which would result in a much narrower application than the Deputy may have in mind.<\/p><p>  While I fully support the promotion of Irish music in our broadcasting services, the policy approach taken to this issue must be consistent with EU and Irish regulatory structures.  It is also important that it takes account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.<\/p><p>As I have previously suggested in meetings I have had with Irish music representatives, it is my view that the best approach to be followed on this issue is one of direct engagement with the radio sector with a view to establishing a mutually acceptable treatment of Irish music.  To my mind, this is likely to produce a far more successful and sustainable position in regard to the broadcasting of Irish music, rather than seeking the imposition of artificial quotas such as those being suggested by the Deputy.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100061#WRP02000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":447,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100061#WRP02050"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[14569\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100061#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his attention has been drawn to any research in the field of alternative energy sources associated with Thorium; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>My Department is aware that thorium is an alternative to uranium as a fuel for nuclear fission.

There are a number of specific recommendations in the report about the services provided by the Legal Aid Board and I will address these in my reply.<\/p><p>  Having regard to the significantly increased demand for services from the Legal Aid Board in recent years, it was decided to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid for 2013 at the same level as last year. The Board, in common with all public service organisations, has to manage the delivery of their services in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible having regard to ongoing pressure on the public finances. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, I have further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service is currently running a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, will be made in the coming months.<\/p><p>  The Board has examined its current operating environment as well as the international experience of civil legal aid services. It has also considered and examined the possible evolution of future service delivery models in order to address increasing demand for services.  This examination has led to the evolution of three central principles which will enable the organisation to deliver services in different and innovative ways that makes optimum use of the resources at the Board&rsquo;s disposal. These principles, which are fully consistent with government policy in relation to reforming our public services, are:<\/p><p>- to move away from a &ldquo;litigation first&rdquo; outlook to the provision of services to a more robust emphasis on alternative dispute resolution; <\/p><p>- a much greater engagement with the use of IT resources to improve efficiency and throughput of cases (the Board has recently introduced a new legal case management system (EOS) which is designed to improve efficiency and case throughput in law centres while also providing better management information to the Board); and<\/p><p>- to manage risk and performance more effectively both organisation wide and locally building on existing arrangements and ensuring a greater emphasis on compliance with procedures for quality assuring service delivery.<\/p><p>  The decision to transfer responsibility for the Family Mediation Service from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board has enabled the Board to take a more integrated approach to resolving family law disputes. In this connection, a review of the operation of the integrated family mediation initiative in Dolphin House in Dublin, involving the Board and the Courts Service, has resulted in a significant number of family law disputes being resolved through mediation. Such disputes would traditionally have been dealt with through litigation at greater cost to the state and often with a greater level of personal trauma for the parties involved. The Board has recently extended this approach to both Cork and Naas in cooperation with the Courts Service. I welcome the Board&rsquo;s efforts in this regard as it is fully consistent with government policy to extend the scope of mediation generally as a more cost effective means of resolving disputes that might otherwise end up before the courts.<\/p><p>  The Board is also in the processing of extending a &rdquo;triage service&rdquo; across its law centre network which involves providing applicants with access to a solicitor for advice within four weeks of their application for legal services being accepted. A review of the operation of a pilot &ldquo;triage service&rdquo; in five locations during 2012 demonstrated that applicants were overwhelmingly satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.<\/p><p>  In relation to some of the other specific recommendations in the report of the Task Force, the Board is examining the manner in which it uses private solicitors to assist with the provision of legal services with a view to ensuring that the benefits from their use are maximised within the resources available. In 2012, over 5,000 applicants for legal aid were referred to private practitioners, mainly for district court remedies. The Board has also made a proposal to my Department that no financial contribution should be payable by a person who is seeking legal services to defend proceedings on foot of the Child Care Act 1991. I am currently considering this specific matter in the context of an overall package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid. I will also have regard to the views of the Task Force in reaching a decision on this matter in due course. Under the existing regulations, the Board already has in place provisions for waiving financial contributions where not to do so would cause undue hardship to the person seeking legal services. Accordingly, this particular provision can be applied in the meantime, at the Board&rsquo;s discretion, to cases involving the defence of proceedings under the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Maternity Leave","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[14460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda&iacute; that availed of maternity leave in 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":534,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda&iacute; who availed of maternity leave in 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013 is as set out in the table hereunder:<\/p><p><pli4><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th><div>Paid Maternity Leave<\/div><\/th><th><div>Unpaid Maternity Leave<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td><div>273<\/div><\/td><td><div>123<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td><div>330<\/div><\/td><td><div>121<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td><div>88<\/div><\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><\/PLI4><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Sick Leave","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRS01550"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[14461\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda&iacute; that availed of sick leave in 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013, broken down by district and division; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and it has not been possible for the Garda authorities to supply the information requested within the allotted time scale.

In order to achieve these goals the existing communications infrastructure of the Irish Prison Service, which has sufficient call handling capacity to service the needs of my Department, is being utilised thereby leveraging existing assets and investment in the Justice sector.<\/p><p>  The ongoing implementation and roll-out of new technologies in the Justice sector under the auspices of the ICT Shared Services will facilitate the adoption of integrated voice response systems where required as well as numerous other features and services.  This strategy is specifically intended to facilitate the consolidation of existing switchboard and related services along the lines raised by the Deputy but the ultimate benefits will be far broader as the strategy will enable the consolidation and integration of existing diverse services. My Department has also gone to tender for the provision of telephonist and receptionist services for it and some of its agencies.  The procurement process is still ongoing and should result in further cost savings.<\/p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department has introduced an 076 number for the new Insolvency Service of Ireland rather than an 1890 number.  My Department will work with agencies on its ICT Shared Service who have existing 1890 numbers with a view to implementing a phased transition to 076 numbers.  The strategy of leveraging and further developing investment in ICT is intended to drive internal business efficiencies, including cost savings, facilitate a better service to the public and allow my Department and related agencies to take full advantage of the possibilities afforded by newer technologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRS02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Presidential Reports","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[14534\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he received a copy of the Being Young and Irish &ndash; Take Charge of Change report from the Office of the President, &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in as part of President Higgins series of seminars with young persons here which took place in Dublin, Galway, Monaghan and Cork in 2012; if he has noted the Take Charge of Change declaration made by the participants; the steps he has taken arising out of the report&rsquo;s findings in order to achieve young person&rsquo;s vision for Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that it would appear that my Department did not receive a copy of the Being Young and Irish - Take Charge of Change report.

There are 3 daily rates 95 cent, &euro;1.70 and &euro;2.20 depending on the behaviour and engagement of the prisoner. Prisoners who engage in certain prison work activities, e.g. kitchen, are entitled to 50 cent per half day session. There is no restriction on remand prisoners engaging in prison work activities.<\/p><p>In relation to Cloverhill Prison, which is the largest remand prison, given the transitory nature of the prisoners it is not practical to provide the full range of long-term programmes that is available to sentenced prisoners in other prisons. There is a small education unit which currently has an enrolment of about 110 prisoners. Work training activities are provided in the kitchen, laundry, industrial cleaning and grounds maintenance and has a capacity in excess of 40 prisoners.  Cloverhill has a dedicated forensic in-reach and court liaison service consisting of a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, Registrars and Community Mental Health Nurses.

My intention is to ensure that bail law is clear on its face to all interested parties including the public, the courts and practitioners. I also believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail. <\/p><p>   The review is of course subject to constitutional and European Convention of Human Rights requirements in relation to the right to liberty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights  restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. <\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  <\/p><p>  The review includes examination of the extent to which  bail provisions can be stated in a way that emphasises the object of protection against the commission of serious offences by persons who have been charged with serious offences.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.

It is of course open to any person who believes that he or she has been incorrectly refused bail in the District Court in respect of a minor offence to apply for bail to the High Court.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to develop bail supports and services in the community as part of bail reform.<\/p><p>  I will bring my proposals to Government in relation to new bail legislation as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Detention Centres","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRU00600"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[14620\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the plans he has to develop non-custodial, holistic centres for women offenders in the community, which address their needs, vulnerabilities and offending behaviour in a safe, secure, woman only environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":583,"content":"<p>The Probation Service is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in our communities.

The deputy will be aware that, on the basis of compromise texts tabled by the Irish Presidency, the Council successfully adopted a General Approach on CAP Reform by a strong qualified majority.  This has been achieved against a background of lengthy intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues, across a range of complex and sensitive issues.  <\/p><p>  Concluding the Council approach was not only a successful outcome for the Irish Presidency but also represents a good outcome for Irish farmers.  The key outstanding issue from an Irish perspective related to the distribution of Direct Payments within Member States.  I am very pleased that the Council endorsed the principle of flexibility that I have been seeking and agreed to the inclusion of the Irish model of partial convergence to a flat rate system in the options available for distribution of Direct Payments.  This increases the prospect of significantly lower transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat rate proposal. <\/p><p>  I was also pleased with the Council&rsquo;s agreement to my proposals on the greening of direct payments.  These proposals bring the necessary flexibility to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals, so that farmers can practise sustainable agriculture without overly bureaucratic impediments.  The agreement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for a greening payment to be applied as a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s single payment rather than as a flat rate.<\/p><p>  Another good outcome is the agreement amongst my Council colleagues to end sugar quotas in 2017. This is a good compromise as it pulls back substantially from the 2020 end date that had been demanded by many Member States.  In relation to voluntary coupled support, Ireland will have the option of using up to 7% of our national envelope for such payments.  There was also agreement to the implementation of new Areas of Natural Constraint and a change in the proposed reference year for the establishment of payment entitlements. <\/p><p>  This General Approach will form the basis for the next step in the negotiation process.  We will now move to the final, so-called &lsquo;trilogue&rsquo;, stage, where the Irish Presidency will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission. The successful completion of the Council&rsquo;s deliberations means that my target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains very much on schedule.  I am very hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Designation","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[14607\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a submission (details supplied) regarding designation of lands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":654,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the designation of Natura 2000 sites, including Hen Harrier habitats, and all associated issues lies within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

In July 2011, the restriction that mandated 90% of the expenditure of the fund to the private sector was lifted and the referral process changed to enable the SDU and NTPF team to redirect its capability to supporting hospitals to reduce maximum waiting times.  The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times for patients.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account. The overall performance of the acute hospital system in responding to the challenge of reducing maximum waiting times was impressive during 2012, particularly when the health service has been under considerable pressure.  Whilst the most important contribution to this preliminary success has been the work of clinical and managerial leaders in individual hospitals, it must also be acknowledged that the NTPF capability in supporting the SDU has also been a contributing factor.<\/p><p>Statutory responsibility for the collection, collation and validation of data on waiting times and numbers of persons waiting for hospital treatment rests with the NTPF.  The NTPF collects information on hospital in-patients and day case waiting times and has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  Improving access to outpatient services, including specialist ear, nose and throat consultations, is a key priority for the Government.  For the first time outpatient waiting list data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding antibiotic medication, patients awaiting ENT consultations may require antibiotics depending on clinical indications.  Antibiotics are specific medications used to treat bacterial infections and should only be used when clinically indicated.  They do not treat viral infections.  As part of its policy to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics the Health Service Executive has developed primary care antibiotic guidelines.  These guidelines clearly indicate when antibiotics should be prescribed and include a section on ENT indications.  The guidelines have been widely distributed to General Practitioners and Primary Care Centres, are accessible using a smart phone and  available on a website provided by the HSE and RCPI Clinical Programme, working with the ICGP.  It is important that antibiotics are prescribed only when indicated, to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre monitors antibiotic use in hospitals and in the community on an on-going basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Licensing","counter":678,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRX00450"},{"type":"question","counter":679,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[14374\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100064#WRX00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the drug Mabcampath will be licensed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":680,"content":"<p>Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

The report recommends a person centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and most importantly evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.  <i>Reach Out,<\/i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (2005 &#8211; 2014) makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast-track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  This Government has prioritised the reform of our mental health services and is committed in particular to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community.  In this regard substantial additional funding has been provided in 2012 and 2013 primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both children&#8217;s and adult&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities.  Key initiatives progressed by the National Office for Suicide Prevention in 2012 include<b><i><\/i><\/b>the<b><\/b>provision of a wide range of awareness and training programmes including safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Training) which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community, the continuation of the National Awareness Campaigns which, last year, specifically targeted men and young men, the funding of partner agencies and projects and the development of the recently launched Guidance for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention developed with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><b>  National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016:<\/b> The National Drugs Strategy sets out drugs policy in Ireland for the period up to 2016.  Drugs policy encompasses five pillars - supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research and clear actions are in place for implementation.  Good progress is being made across the actions of the Strategy, with the involvement of the statutory, voluntary and community sectors.  Progress continues to be reviewed through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.<\/p><p><b>  Suggestion to Legalise Cannabis:<\/b> International research shows that significant physical and mental health risks are associated with long-term cannabis use.  These include increased risks of developing lung and throat cancer (smoke from cannabis contains more carcinogenic tars than does tobacco smoke) and risks associated with the development of mental illness, such as schizophrenia and depression.  The potency of cannabis products can also vary greatly.  The 2011 NACD study <i>The potency of THC in cannabis products<\/i> reported the growing concern about the significant rise in the potency levels in some cannabis products over the last number of years, particularly in herbal cannabis.  Concerns have also been raised that cannabis produced in Ireland, and used relatively quickly, has a higher potency than imported varieties.  There is also evidence that cannabis plants generally are being genetically engineered to ensure they produce high levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).  Legalisation would be likely to lead to greatly increased levels of experimentation, leading to significantly increased levels of sustained long term use causing increased health problems in our society.  Indeed, the situation that pertained only a few years ago in Ireland in regard to the volume of new psychoactive substances sold in headshops illustrates this point.  People were prepared to experiment with readily available legal products, despite the publicity regarding the consequences.  Legalisation would be unlikely to significantly reduce the level of criminality surrounding the broader market in illicit drugs.  Also, if cannabis was legalised, it would most likely be strongly regulated and probably heavily priced to influence demand (as in the case of tobacco).  This in turn could lead to the continuation of an illicit market on similar lines to the black market of cigarettes.  Overall, the amount of money likely to be raised in tax would be small in relation to the health and other implications arising.  Cannabis was re-classified from a Class C drug to a Class B drug in the UK in 2009.  This decision was taken in the light of the &quot;real public concern about the potential mental health affects of cannabis use, in particular the use of stronger forms of the drug&quot;.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, any possibility of legalising cannabis has to be looked at in a European and global context.  A unilateral decision to legalise its use here would most likely lead to Ireland becoming a destination for those from other countries who wish to use cannabis.  In view of the evidence available I am not in favour of legalising the use of cannabis at this time.<\/p><p><b>  Disability Services: <\/b>The report, &quot;Being Young and Irish 2012 &#8211; Take Charge of Change&quot; from the Office of the President highlights similar issues considered by the Department's recent Value for Money and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published in July 2012.  Minister Kathleen Lynch recently approved the National Implementation Framework of the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published on the Department's website (<i>www.doh.ie<\/i>) on 28 February last.  The development of the Framework is one of the key actions identified in <i>Future Health,<\/i> the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &#8211; 2015.  It supports the message coming through from <i>Future Health<\/i> regarding the need to restructure service delivery, and improve organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems with the aim of providing a more effective and more accountable service.  The vision of the Disability Services Programme as set out in the VFM Review is <i>&quot;to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being&quot;.  <\/i>The recommendations in the Review describe how this vision is to be given tangible effect.  The National Implementation Framework determines how the recommendations from the VFM Review are translated into concrete actions.  It assigns responsibilities for those actions, and specifies time-lines for their completion.  It also identifies priorities and key performance indicators.  The Framework describes the project management and monitoring processes which are needed to make sure that the reform of the Disability Services Programme is achieved in a planned, timely and cost effective manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  The implementation of the recommendations in the manner set out in the National Implementation Framework will ultimately improve the lives of people with disabilities in the following ways: people with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services; services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion; the move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated; supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.<\/p><p><b>  Alcohol: <\/b>The report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy 2012 contains a number of recommendations to, inter alia, reduce the consumption of alcohol in general and are grouped under the five pillars of Supply Reduction, Prevention, Treatment, Rehabilitation and Research.

It may be implemented in many ways, but the essence of individualised budgeting is that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised. This approach must be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated.  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Review. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.

There are currently remand prisoners in 11 of the 14 prisons.  This range of programmes is available across the prison estate and all prisoners, both sentenced and remand, are eligible to use the services.   On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<\/p><p>Remand prisoners are entitled to the same rates of daily gratuity as sentenced prisoners. There are 3 daily rates 95 cent, &euro;1.70 and &euro;2.20 depending on the behaviour and engagement of the prisoner. Prisoners who engage in certain prison work activities, e.g. kitchen, are entitled to 50 cent per half day session. There is no restriction on remand prisoners engaging in prison work activities.<\/p><p>In relation to Cloverhill Prison, which is the largest remand prison, given the transitory nature of the prisoners it is not practical to provide the full range of long-term programmes that is available to sentenced prisoners in other prisons. There is a small education unit which currently has an enrolment of about 110 prisoners. Work training activities are provided in the kitchen, laundry, industrial cleaning and grounds maintenance and has a capacity in excess of 40 prisoners.  Cloverhill has a dedicated forensic in-reach and court liaison service consisting of a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, Registrars and Community Mental Health Nurses.

My intention is to ensure that bail law is clear on its face to all interested parties including the public, the courts and practitioners. I also believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail. <\/p><p>   The review is of course subject to constitutional and European Convention of Human Rights requirements in relation to the right to liberty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights  restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. <\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  <\/p><p>  The review includes examination of the extent to which  bail provisions can be stated in a way that emphasises the object of protection against the commission of serious offences by persons who have been charged with serious offences.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on decisions taken by a court in relation to any bail applications. It is of course open to any person who believes that he or she has been incorrectly refused bail in the District Court in respect of a minor offence to apply for bail to the High Court.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to develop bail supports and services in the community as part of bail reform.<\/p><p>  I will bring my proposals to Government in relation to new bail legislation as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Detention Centres","counter":808,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRU00600"},{"type":"question","counter":809,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[14620\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the plans he has to develop non-custodial, holistic centres for women offenders in the community, which address their needs, vulnerabilities and offending behaviour in a safe, secure, woman only environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":810,"content":"<p>The Probation Service is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in our communities.

The deputy will be aware that, on the basis of compromise texts tabled by the Irish Presidency, the Council successfully adopted a General Approach on CAP Reform by a strong qualified majority.  This has been achieved against a background of lengthy intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues, across a range of complex and sensitive issues.  <\/p><p>  Concluding the Council approach was not only a successful outcome for the Irish Presidency but also represents a good outcome for Irish farmers.  The key outstanding issue from an Irish perspective related to the distribution of Direct Payments within Member States.  I am very pleased that the Council endorsed the principle of flexibility that I have been seeking and agreed to the inclusion of the Irish model of partial convergence to a flat rate system in the options available for distribution of Direct Payments.  This increases the prospect of significantly lower transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat rate proposal. <\/p><p>  I was also pleased with the Council&rsquo;s agreement to my proposals on the greening of direct payments.  These proposals bring the necessary flexibility to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals, so that farmers can practise sustainable agriculture without overly bureaucratic impediments.  The agreement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for a greening payment to be applied as a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s single payment rather than as a flat rate.<\/p><p>  Another good outcome is the agreement amongst my Council colleagues to end sugar quotas in 2017. This is a good compromise as it pulls back substantially from the 2020 end date that had been demanded by many Member States.  In relation to voluntary coupled support, Ireland will have the option of using up to 7% of our national envelope for such payments.  There was also agreement to the implementation of new Areas of Natural Constraint and a change in the proposed reference year for the establishment of payment entitlements. <\/p><p>  This General Approach will form the basis for the next step in the negotiation process.  We will now move to the final, so-called &lsquo;trilogue&rsquo;, stage, where the Irish Presidency will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission. The successful completion of the Council&rsquo;s deliberations means that my target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains very much on schedule.  I am very hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Designation","counter":879,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":880,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[14607\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a submission (details supplied) regarding designation of lands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":881,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the designation of Natura 2000 sites, including Hen Harrier habitats, and all associated issues lies within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

In July 2011, the restriction that mandated 90% of the expenditure of the fund to the private sector was lifted and the referral process changed to enable the SDU and NTPF team to redirect its capability to supporting hospitals to reduce maximum waiting times.  The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times for patients.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account. The overall performance of the acute hospital system in responding to the challenge of reducing maximum waiting times was impressive during 2012, particularly when the health service has been under considerable pressure.  Whilst the most important contribution to this preliminary success has been the work of clinical and managerial leaders in individual hospitals, it must also be acknowledged that the NTPF capability in supporting the SDU has also been a contributing factor.<\/p><p>Statutory responsibility for the collection, collation and validation of data on waiting times and numbers of persons waiting for hospital treatment rests with the NTPF.  The NTPF collects information on hospital in-patients and day case waiting times and has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  Improving access to outpatient services, including specialist ear, nose and throat consultations, is a key priority for the Government.  For the first time outpatient waiting list data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding antibiotic medication, patients awaiting ENT consultations may require antibiotics depending on clinical indications.  Antibiotics are specific medications used to treat bacterial infections and should only be used when clinically indicated.  They do not treat viral infections.  As part of its policy to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics the Health Service Executive has developed primary care antibiotic guidelines.  These guidelines clearly indicate when antibiotics should be prescribed and include a section on ENT indications.  The guidelines have been widely distributed to General Practitioners and Primary Care Centres, are accessible using a smart phone and  available on a website provided by the HSE and RCPI Clinical Programme, working with the ICGP.  It is important that antibiotics are prescribed only when indicated, to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre monitors antibiotic use in hospitals and in the community on an on-going basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Licensing","counter":905,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRX00450"},{"type":"question","counter":906,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[14374\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100065#WRX00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the drug Mabcampath will be licensed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":907,"content":"<p>Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

The report recommends a person centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and most importantly evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.  <i>Reach Out,<\/i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (2005 &#8211; 2014) makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast-track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  This Government has prioritised the reform of our mental health services and is committed in particular to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community.  In this regard substantial additional funding has been provided in 2012 and 2013 primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both children&#8217;s and adult&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities.  Key initiatives progressed by the National Office for Suicide Prevention in 2012 include<b><i><\/i><\/b>the<b><\/b>provision of a wide range of awareness and training programmes including safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Training) which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community, the continuation of the National Awareness Campaigns which, last year, specifically targeted men and young men, the funding of partner agencies and projects and the development of the recently launched Guidance for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention developed with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><b>  National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016:<\/b> The National Drugs Strategy sets out drugs policy in Ireland for the period up to 2016.  Drugs policy encompasses five pillars - supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research and clear actions are in place for implementation.  Good progress is being made across the actions of the Strategy, with the involvement of the statutory, voluntary and community sectors.  Progress continues to be reviewed through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.<\/p><p><b>  Suggestion to Legalise Cannabis:<\/b> International research shows that significant physical and mental health risks are associated with long-term cannabis use.  These include increased risks of developing lung and throat cancer (smoke from cannabis contains more carcinogenic tars than does tobacco smoke) and risks associated with the development of mental illness, such as schizophrenia and depression.  The potency of cannabis products can also vary greatly.  The 2011 NACD study <i>The potency of THC in cannabis products<\/i> reported the growing concern about the significant rise in the potency levels in some cannabis products over the last number of years, particularly in herbal cannabis.  Concerns have also been raised that cannabis produced in Ireland, and used relatively quickly, has a higher potency than imported varieties.  There is also evidence that cannabis plants generally are being genetically engineered to ensure they produce high levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).  Legalisation would be likely to lead to greatly increased levels of experimentation, leading to significantly increased levels of sustained long term use causing increased health problems in our society.  Indeed, the situation that pertained only a few years ago in Ireland in regard to the volume of new psychoactive substances sold in headshops illustrates this point.  People were prepared to experiment with readily available legal products, despite the publicity regarding the consequences.  Legalisation would be unlikely to significantly reduce the level of criminality surrounding the broader market in illicit drugs.  Also, if cannabis was legalised, it would most likely be strongly regulated and probably heavily priced to influence demand (as in the case of tobacco).  This in turn could lead to the continuation of an illicit market on similar lines to the black market of cigarettes.  Overall, the amount of money likely to be raised in tax would be small in relation to the health and other implications arising.  Cannabis was re-classified from a Class C drug to a Class B drug in the UK in 2009.  This decision was taken in the light of the &quot;real public concern about the potential mental health affects of cannabis use, in particular the use of stronger forms of the drug&quot;.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, any possibility of legalising cannabis has to be looked at in a European and global context.  A unilateral decision to legalise its use here would most likely lead to Ireland becoming a destination for those from other countries who wish to use cannabis.  In view of the evidence available I am not in favour of legalising the use of cannabis at this time.<\/p><p><b>  Disability Services: <\/b>The report, &quot;Being Young and Irish 2012 &#8211; Take Charge of Change&quot; from the Office of the President highlights similar issues considered by the Department's recent Value for Money and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published in July 2012.  Minister Kathleen Lynch recently approved the National Implementation Framework of the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published on the Department's website (<i>www.doh.ie<\/i>) on 28 February last.  The development of the Framework is one of the key actions identified in <i>Future Health,<\/i> the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &#8211; 2015.  It supports the message coming through from <i>Future Health<\/i> regarding the need to restructure service delivery, and improve organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems with the aim of providing a more effective and more accountable service.  The vision of the Disability Services Programme as set out in the VFM Review is <i>&quot;to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being&quot;.  <\/i>The recommendations in the Review describe how this vision is to be given tangible effect.  The National Implementation Framework determines how the recommendations from the VFM Review are translated into concrete actions.  It assigns responsibilities for those actions, and specifies time-lines for their completion.  It also identifies priorities and key performance indicators.  The Framework describes the project management and monitoring processes which are needed to make sure that the reform of the Disability Services Programme is achieved in a planned, timely and cost effective manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  The implementation of the recommendations in the manner set out in the National Implementation Framework will ultimately improve the lives of people with disabilities in the following ways: people with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services; services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion; the move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated; supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.<\/p><p><b>  Alcohol: <\/b>The report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy 2012 contains a number of recommendations to, inter alia, reduce the consumption of alcohol in general and are grouped under the five pillars of Supply Reduction, Prevention, Treatment, Rehabilitation and Research.  Real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the report, primarily in the areas of legislation on minimum unit pricing; access and availability of alcohol; advertising and sponsorship.  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has also considered the matter and it is intended to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible.  In the meantime, work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.<\/p><p><b>  Tobacco<\/b>: My Department is currently developing a new tobacco policy with the aim of de-normalising tobacco smoking that will lead to a tobacco free society.

The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Review.

My intention is to ensure that bail law is clear on its face to all interested parties including the public, the courts and practitioners. I also believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail. <\/p><p>   The review is of course subject to constitutional and European Convention of Human Rights requirements in relation to the right to liberty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights  restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. <\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  <\/p><p>  The review includes examination of the extent to which  bail provisions can be stated in a way that emphasises the object of protection against the commission of serious offences by persons who have been charged with serious offences.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.

It is of course open to any person who believes that he or she has been incorrectly refused bail in the District Court in respect of a minor offence to apply for bail to the High Court.<\/p><p>  There are no plans to develop bail supports and services in the community as part of bail reform.<\/p><p>  I will bring my proposals to Government in relation to new bail legislation as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100066#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Detention Centres","counter":1006,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100066#WRU00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1007,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[14620\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100066#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the plans he has to develop non-custodial, holistic centres for women offenders in the community, which address their needs, vulnerabilities and offending behaviour in a safe, secure, woman only environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1008,"content":"<p>The Probation Service is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in our communities.

The deputy will be aware that, on the basis of compromise texts tabled by the Irish Presidency, the Council successfully adopted a General Approach on CAP Reform by a strong qualified majority.  This has been achieved against a background of lengthy intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues, across a range of complex and sensitive issues.  <\/p><p>  Concluding the Council approach was not only a successful outcome for the Irish Presidency but also represents a good outcome for Irish farmers.  The key outstanding issue from an Irish perspective related to the distribution of Direct Payments within Member States.  I am very pleased that the Council endorsed the principle of flexibility that I have been seeking and agreed to the inclusion of the Irish model of partial convergence to a flat rate system in the options available for distribution of Direct Payments.  This increases the prospect of significantly lower transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat rate proposal. <\/p><p>  I was also pleased with the Council&rsquo;s agreement to my proposals on the greening of direct payments.  These proposals bring the necessary flexibility to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals, so that farmers can practise sustainable agriculture without overly bureaucratic impediments.  The agreement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for a greening payment to be applied as a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s single payment rather than as a flat rate.<\/p><p>  Another good outcome is the agreement amongst my Council colleagues to end sugar quotas in 2017. This is a good compromise as it pulls back substantially from the 2020 end date that had been demanded by many Member States.  In relation to voluntary coupled support, Ireland will have the option of using up to 7% of our national envelope for such payments.  There was also agreement to the implementation of new Areas of Natural Constraint and a change in the proposed reference year for the establishment of payment entitlements. <\/p><p>  This General Approach will form the basis for the next step in the negotiation process.  We will now move to the final, so-called &lsquo;trilogue&rsquo;, stage, where the Irish Presidency will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission. The successful completion of the Council&rsquo;s deliberations means that my target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains very much on schedule.  I am very hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100068#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Designation","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100068#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[14607\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100068#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a submission (details supplied) regarding designation of lands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1079,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the designation of Natura 2000 sites, including Hen Harrier habitats, and all associated issues lies within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

In July 2011, the restriction that mandated 90% of the expenditure of the fund to the private sector was lifted and the referral process changed to enable the SDU and NTPF team to redirect its capability to supporting hospitals to reduce maximum waiting times.  The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and assisting in the performance management of hospitals to reduce waiting times for patients.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account. The overall performance of the acute hospital system in responding to the challenge of reducing maximum waiting times was impressive during 2012, particularly when the health service has been under considerable pressure.  Whilst the most important contribution to this preliminary success has been the work of clinical and managerial leaders in individual hospitals, it must also be acknowledged that the NTPF capability in supporting the SDU has also been a contributing factor.<\/p><p>Statutory responsibility for the collection, collation and validation of data on waiting times and numbers of persons waiting for hospital treatment rests with the NTPF.  The NTPF collects information on hospital in-patients and day case waiting times and has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  Improving access to outpatient services, including specialist ear, nose and throat consultations, is a key priority for the Government.  For the first time outpatient waiting list data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding antibiotic medication, patients awaiting ENT consultations may require antibiotics depending on clinical indications.  Antibiotics are specific medications used to treat bacterial infections and should only be used when clinically indicated.  They do not treat viral infections.  As part of its policy to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics the Health Service Executive has developed primary care antibiotic guidelines.  These guidelines clearly indicate when antibiotics should be prescribed and include a section on ENT indications.  The guidelines have been widely distributed to General Practitioners and Primary Care Centres, are accessible using a smart phone and  available on a website provided by the HSE and RCPI Clinical Programme, working with the ICGP.  It is important that antibiotics are prescribed only when indicated, to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre monitors antibiotic use in hospitals and in the community on an on-going basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100069#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Licensing","counter":1103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100069#WRX00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1104,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[14374\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100069#WRX00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the drug Mabcampath will be licensed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1105,"content":"<p>Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

The report recommends a person centred treatment approach which addresses each of these elements through an integrated care plan, reflecting best practice, and most importantly evolved and agreed with both service users and their carers.  <i>Reach Out,<\/i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention (2005 &#8211; 2014) makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast-track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  This Government has prioritised the reform of our mental health services and is committed in particular to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community.  In this regard substantial additional funding has been provided in 2012 and 2013 primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both children&#8217;s and adult&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities.  Key initiatives progressed by the National Office for Suicide Prevention in 2012 include<b><i><\/i><\/b>the<b><\/b>provision of a wide range of awareness and training programmes including safeTALK and ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Training) which trains participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community, the continuation of the National Awareness Campaigns which, last year, specifically targeted men and young men, the funding of partner agencies and projects and the development of the recently launched Guidance for Post-Primary Schools on Mental Health and Suicide Prevention developed with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><b>  National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016:<\/b> The National Drugs Strategy sets out drugs policy in Ireland for the period up to 2016.  Drugs policy encompasses five pillars - supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research and clear actions are in place for implementation.  Good progress is being made across the actions of the Strategy, with the involvement of the statutory, voluntary and community sectors.  Progress continues to be reviewed through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.<\/p><p><b>  Suggestion to Legalise Cannabis:<\/b> International research shows that significant physical and mental health risks are associated with long-term cannabis use.  These include increased risks of developing lung and throat cancer (smoke from cannabis contains more carcinogenic tars than does tobacco smoke) and risks associated with the development of mental illness, such as schizophrenia and depression.  The potency of cannabis products can also vary greatly.  The 2011 NACD study <i>The potency of THC in cannabis products<\/i> reported the growing concern about the significant rise in the potency levels in some cannabis products over the last number of years, particularly in herbal cannabis.  Concerns have also been raised that cannabis produced in Ireland, and used relatively quickly, has a higher potency than imported varieties.  There is also evidence that cannabis plants generally are being genetically engineered to ensure they produce high levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).  Legalisation would be likely to lead to greatly increased levels of experimentation, leading to significantly increased levels of sustained long term use causing increased health problems in our society.  Indeed, the situation that pertained only a few years ago in Ireland in regard to the volume of new psychoactive substances sold in headshops illustrates this point.  People were prepared to experiment with readily available legal products, despite the publicity regarding the consequences.  Legalisation would be unlikely to significantly reduce the level of criminality surrounding the broader market in illicit drugs.  Also, if cannabis was legalised, it would most likely be strongly regulated and probably heavily priced to influence demand (as in the case of tobacco).  This in turn could lead to the continuation of an illicit market on similar lines to the black market of cigarettes.  Overall, the amount of money likely to be raised in tax would be small in relation to the health and other implications arising.  Cannabis was re-classified from a Class C drug to a Class B drug in the UK in 2009.  This decision was taken in the light of the &quot;real public concern about the potential mental health affects of cannabis use, in particular the use of stronger forms of the drug&quot;.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, any possibility of legalising cannabis has to be looked at in a European and global context.  A unilateral decision to legalise its use here would most likely lead to Ireland becoming a destination for those from other countries who wish to use cannabis.  In view of the evidence available I am not in favour of legalising the use of cannabis at this time.<\/p><p><b>  Disability Services: <\/b>The report, &quot;Being Young and Irish 2012 &#8211; Take Charge of Change&quot; from the Office of the President highlights similar issues considered by the Department's recent Value for Money and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published in July 2012.  Minister Kathleen Lynch recently approved the National Implementation Framework of the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of the Disability Services Programme which was published on the Department's website (<i>www.doh.ie<\/i>) on 28 February last.  The development of the Framework is one of the key actions identified in <i>Future Health,<\/i> the recently published Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &#8211; 2015.  It supports the message coming through from <i>Future Health<\/i> regarding the need to restructure service delivery, and improve organisational, financial, governance and accountability systems with the aim of providing a more effective and more accountable service.  The vision of the Disability Services Programme as set out in the VFM Review is <i>&quot;to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being&quot;.  <\/i>The recommendations in the Review describe how this vision is to be given tangible effect.  The National Implementation Framework determines how the recommendations from the VFM Review are translated into concrete actions.  It assigns responsibilities for those actions, and specifies time-lines for their completion.  It also identifies priorities and key performance indicators.  The Framework describes the project management and monitoring processes which are needed to make sure that the reform of the Disability Services Programme is achieved in a planned, timely and cost effective manner.<\/p><p><br \/>  The implementation of the recommendations in the manner set out in the National Implementation Framework will ultimately improve the lives of people with disabilities in the following ways: people with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services; services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion; the move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated; supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.<\/p><p><b>  Alcohol: <\/b>The report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy 2012 contains a number of recommendations to, inter alia, reduce the consumption of alcohol in general and are grouped under the five pillars of Supply Reduction, Prevention, Treatment, Rehabilitation and Research.

It may be implemented in many ways, but the essence of individualised budgeting is that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised. This approach must be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated.  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Review. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure their long-term viability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100071#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100071#WRZ00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":1171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100071#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1172,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[14432\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100071#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the major road construction projects and major rail investment programmes that he will include for funding under the next round of TEN-T programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1173,"content":"<p>In relation to the next round of EU structural funding 2014-2020\u00a0the draft Ten-T and CEF Regulations are currently\u00a0under negotiation and it is hoped that they will be agreed during the Irish Presidency.
