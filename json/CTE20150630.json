I will begin by addressing the issue of fleet segmentation.<\/p> <p>  The management of fishing fleets using vessel capacity in terms of vessel volume, which is measured in gross tonnes, and engine power, which is measured in kilowatts, was introduced in the early 1990s and is a cornerstone of the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p><p>It was introduced in the early 1990s.  Capacity limits, known as fleet ceilings, are set at EU level for all member states.  To ensure the fleet ceiling is not exceeded, member states must manage their fleets in such a way that the entry of new capacity into the fleet is balanced by previous withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity.  This is known as the entry-exit regime.<\/p><p> The Irish fishing fleet has been divided into segments since the early 1990s.  The fleet is divided into five segments, in accordance with Ministerial Policy Directive 2 of 2003, as amended.  The five segments are refrigerated seawater, RSW, pelagic vessels, polyvalent, beam trawler, specific and aquaculture.  The specific segment is divided into two sub-segments, namely, scallop and general sub-segment.  The polyvalent segment is divided into four sub-segments, namely, potting, scallop, vessel under 18 m in length overall and vessels greater than or equal to 18 m in length overall.  The transfer of capacity between segments and sub-segments is not permitted.  For vessels to qualify for mackerel and-or herring authorisation, all of the capacity used to license the vessel must have the required track record as stipulated under the individual mackerel and herring fleet policies.<\/p><p> It is important to note fishing capacity is privately owned and is traded independently of the Department and the licensing authority for sea fishing boats.  The current fleet policy has been put in place over many years.  The request for a change in licensing policy involving the removal or amalgamation of segments or sub-segments would have a substantial impact on the Irish fishing fleet.  Potentially, such changes could have impacts on access to fishing resources and the management of quotas.  There are many diverse views in the fishing industry and these often conflict.  It is important, therefore, that views such as those proposed are debated widely in the industry.  The objective is to achieve the maximum possible level of agreement and support in the industry for any proposed changes sought.<\/p><p> The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 transferred the function of sea fishing boat licensing to the licensing authority for sea fishing boats and provides the licensing authority is independent from the Minister in the exercise of its functions.  As Minister, I have responsibility for policy on sea fishing boat licensing and may use policy directives in this regard.  However, under the 2003 Act I am precluded from getting involved in individual cases or a group of cases with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned.  For this reason, it is preferable that proposals for changes to licensing policy are made through the recognised representative structure of producer organisations.  In this way, a business case for change to the licensing policy would be fully examined, including positive and negative consequences for operators with divergent fishing activities and covering large and small operations.  I encourage the group of vessel owners in this instance to engage with the producer organisations so any proposed changes can be brought forward with a full understanding of the views throughout the industry.<\/p><p> Given the potential impact of changes to licensing policy, any amendments I might consider bringing forward would be subject to a public consultation with stakeholders.  We are happy to look at changes but we want to ensure we have a full reflection of the industry perspective, as opposed to one group of stakeholders coming forward with a specific proposal about which many others may have concerns or comments or may decide to support.  Any change we make in what is a very sensitive area, because whenever one segment gains another segment tends to lose, needs to go through a process, and preferably needs to come through the producer organisations which are the official representative bodies of fishermen and boats.  We can answer any questions members may have on this.<\/p><p> With regard to the landing obligation, or the discard ban as many people call it, the recent regional agreement brokered by Ireland on extending the landing obligation to a number of important whitefish stocks brings us another step closer to eliminating the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding.<\/p><p>Everyone is against that, first and foremost, fishermen.<\/p><p> The reform introduced a practical and phased discards policy.  The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks, such as herring and mackerel, came into effect from 1 January 2015.  The landing obligation will be extended to certain demersal stocks - whitefish and prawns - from 1 January 2016 and will be fully phased in by 1 January 2019.  The phasing in period will allow fishermen time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of unwanted catches.<\/p><p> A major element of the new CFP is the introduction of regionalisation.  This gives member states in a region, working together, greater power to make decisions on the management of their own fish stocks and moves away from the former one-size-fits-all approach, which was dictated by the Commission.  It also underscores the importance of meaningful input from stakeholders, requiring that member states consult with the relevant advisory councils, comprising stakeholders from industry and environmental NGOs.  Ireland is a member of the North Western Waters Group along with Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Spain.  The preparation of the discards ban for whitefish species was carried out during the period of Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship of the group and I thank my colleagues on both sides of me for doing a good job in getting an agreement across the line.  The member states worked closely with the North Western Waters Advisory Council, which involves representatives of the fishing industry and other stakeholders.  The council representatives attended and inputted into the meetings  of the North Western Waters Group.  The entire process was demanding, given the high bar of having to come to a unanimous agreement among six member states.  An agreement was finally reached in May on a discard plan for whitefish stocks to take effect from 1 January 2016.  The ban on discarding will apply to the prawn fisheries in all waters, the whiting fishery in the Celtic Sea, which is a complex, mixed fishery, the haddock fishery in the Irish Sea and in the north west area, the hake fishery in all areas and the sole fishery in the Celtic Sea from 1 January 2016. <\/p><p> The vessels, which will be subject to the landing obligation in 2016, will be identified on the basis of a combination of gear type and historic landing data.  For example, a vessel that had landings in 2013 and 2014 of more than 25% cod, haddock, whiting and saithe combined in its landings in the Celtic Sea will be obliged to land all whiting in 2016.  The other species will be phased in over the following three years.   Another important element is the inclusion of what are known as deminimis exemptions.  What this means is that, in the example I just gave, a vessel obliged to land whiting in the Celtic Sea will still be allowed to discard a small percentage. These deminimis exemptions are only allowed where it is difficult in the short term to dramatically improve selectivity without having an unduly onerous economic effect on the boat concerned.<\/p><p> With regard to setting TACs and quotas for 2016 in December, which is the positive news apart from rebuilding stocks, I will seek a quota uplift for the stocks subject to the landing obligation.  This is needed to take account of the situation whereby, in 2016, discarding of these stocks will not be permitted.  In other words, we are moving away from a quota allocated on the basis of a landed quota.  If somebody had five tonnes of quota and caught seven tonnes of the species, he can only land five tonnes.  Historically, he would always have been required to discard the other two tonnes at sea. There was nothing illegal about this because that is the way the policy worked.  From now on, fishermen will be given a catch quota, not a landed quota.  They will be required to land everything they catch within the flexibility of the rules that apply in respect of deminimis and so on.  That should mean that taking existing records relating to discards within specific fisheries into account, there should be an uplift when moving from a landed quota to a catch quota.  The Irish industry has been kept fully informed throughout this process through the discards implementation group, chaired by Dr. Noel Cawley.<\/p><p>I established this group to allow the Irish fishing industry to be fully prepared for and engaged in the implementation of the discards ban, which is going to be challenging but which, I believe, is doable.  Agreement on the discards plan for 2016 provides the discards implementation group with a clear blueprint to help prepare the industry for the forthcoming changes.  I am providing funding support for the fishing industry through the new EU fisheries operational programme, which I am currently progressing, for effective delivery of the new measures.  I have made &euro;450,000 available to BIM and the Marine Institute in order that they might undertake a project exploring the potential impact of the landing obligation on commercial fishing activity during the summer months.  This project will follow up on the discards simulation trials conducted last autumn.<\/p><p> I firmly believe that the biggest challenge will be to develop and implement improvements in selectivity and to develop other means to enable fishermen to avoid juvenile fish or unwanted catches.  The national discards implementation group is prioritising this work, as indeed are the producer organisations.  Our fishermen, working with BIM and the Marine Institute, are best placed to find better ways of fishing.  I will strongly support this work through the new fisheries operational programme and I am confident that we are moving forward into an era in which healthy fish stocks, fished sustainably, will be the norm.  The latter will give assurances of economic stability and profitability to our fishing industry and dependent coastal communities.<\/p><p> In the event that anyone is in any doubt as to the extent of the discards problem, it is important that I place some facts on the record in order to highlight the challenge we are facing and to explain why we are making the changes I have outlined.  Among the annual catch of 6,556 tonnes of Celtic Sea haddock, we are currently discarding 2,227 tonnes.  This represents a discard rate of 49%.  Of the average annual catch of 6,633 tonnes of Celtic Sea whiting, we are currently discarding 1,669 tonnes, or 25%.  The discard rate for Celtic Sea plaice is 57%.  In the context of Irish Sea haddock, it is 37%, for Irish Sea whiting, it is 81%, and for Irish Sea plaice it is 66%.  The discard rate for nephrops is 29%.  What we want to do is ensure that the fish we catch and kill are fish that will actually be sold, that fishermen will obtain a commercial return and that stocks will not be damaged as a result of fish being caught and killed at sea and then discarded, or thrown back into the water, because the fishermen involved do not have quotas to land them on the shore.  This is the biggest challenge in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy.  We are moving towards the use of maximum sustainable yield, MSY, which is a more scientific calculation for maximising fish catches commercially while simultaneously protecting fish stocks.  We have obtained agreement in terms of regional decision making, which is extremely important, but the big change for both the public and the fishing industry as regards the changes in approach, gear, selectivity, targeting, etc., will be that which relates to the obligation to land.  We will invest a great deal of money, time, resources, effort and support into assisting the industry in this regard.<\/p><p> What I have outlined means that in five, ten or 15 years we will still have a very strong and growing fishing industry, because we will have healthier stocks and quotas that will hopefully be growing as a result.  I am not pretending that introducing an obligation to land or banning discards will not be challenging.  It will be, but we can do it in a way that makes commercial sense for fishermen as well as making environmental sense in the context of the sustainability of fish stocks.  That is the big challenge to be faced and the big ambition behind the new Common Fisheries Policy.  In broad terms, what is being done has been broadly welcomed by NGOs and also within the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#L00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I understand that the Minister will be obliged to leave the meeting at 3.45 p.m. sharp, which means we will have one hour for our deliberations.

The first point everyone must accept is because a thing is as it is or because there is an historic arrangement in place does not mean that it represents best policy either now or into the future.  I understand the nub of the issue here really relates to the pelagic and polyvalent sectors.  The nub issue is that in the whitefish sector, there is tonnage and kilowatts available but that in the polyvalent sector, there is not.  As the Minister appreciates fully, the world does not stand still and members raised an issue with him last year in respect of timber boats that required replacement with steel boats.  At the time, members suggested this be done with safety tonnage but that has now been eliminated.  Consequently, in the case of someone who is obliged to replace a boat with a slightly bigger boat or to replace a timber boat with a steel boat - even if the latter is not significantly bigger and of course the same quota will be allocated to it - or where modifications must be carried out to a boat on the recommendation of the marine safety office that increase its capacity, it is practically impossible to purchase polyvalent tonnage and kilowatts.  Although whitefish tonnage and kilowatts are available, because of the sub-segmentation policy, a person who tries to purchase that particular tonnage and kilowatts, even if it is a very small fraction of the total tonnage and kilowatts on one's boat, in other words, one is only topping it up to comply with the requirements of the size of a boat and the engine power, effectively is locked out of the market.  I understand, for example, that in some cases in which fishermen have been obliged to replace boats, they have wound up in a situation whereby if they inform the Department they intend to buy even a small amount of whitefish, they are being told they cannot fish either all or part of their polyvalent pelagic entitlements.  In other words, they are put out of business.  Consequently, this becomes a catch-22 situation and as the Minister is aware, many fishermen have signed the documentation sent to him outlining their concerns on this matter.<\/p><p>I understand that to every change, there will be people for whom it will not suit but ultimately, as Minister, Deputy Coveney must decide objectively, irrespective of what any group is saying, what is the best and fairest thing for all.  I will give the example of a boat up in County Donegal.  It is an 11.89 m timber vessel and its owner wishes to replace it with an 11.9 m fibreglass vessel but is short three tonnes of the requisite polyvalent pelagic tonnage, as well as being short 25 kW of the requisite associated kilowatts.  He has been offered a licence but basically he is being told he can have the licence but he will be denied his polyvalent pelagic entitlements and the gill-netting entitlements, which effectively would put that fisherman out of business.  The Minister is aware of the situation regarding the sinking of the <i>I&uacute;da Naofa<\/i>off the coast of Scotland and, thankfully, there were no casualties in that event.<\/p><p>Efforts had been made for a long time to replace the <i>I&uacute;da Naofa<\/i>, a timber boat, with a steel frame boat of more or less the same external dimensions.  However, the conditions applied in terms of whitefish tonnage and kilowatts were such that the fishermen in question were put out of business.  I have cited only two examples. <br\/><br\/>I believe the Minister recognises that this issue presents a challenge.  In 2011, modification of a polyvalent pelagic vessel and the use of whitefish tonnage was permitted in one case on safety grounds.  If that was possible then, surely it would not be a major step to make this option available to all fishermen.  I hope the Minister will indicate a willingness to examine the proposal put to him as a matter of urgency and on its own merits.  Having listened to the case made for the proposal, I believe it has merit on the basis that polyvalent fishermen are being locked out of the market and precluded from improving their position.<br\/><br\/>I understand sub-segmentation is not taking place in most other European countries.  If the Minister believes the case put to him has merit, I ask him to immediately commence a public consultation in order that we can advance this issue and ensure the producer organisations and all other individuals and groups are able to make a submission.  Ultimately, the Minister's decision must be based on achieving objective good and fairness for the fishing industry, rather than any view expressed by powerful vested interests.  One of the worries we must have is that a small number of dominant players - the fishing sector has a number of extremely large owners - will exercise inordinate control over the industry.  The Minister is under an obligation to make his decision based on the common good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#P00400","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is substituting for Deputy Martin Ferris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#Q00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I thank the Minister and his officials for appearing before the joint committee.  Based on the information provided by the fleet sub-segmentation lobby group, I get a sense that the Minister has not set out his position on this matter in any great detail.  The group made a highly compelling case and I concur with all of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v in this regard.  The pelagic polyvalent fishing sector appears to be on its knees.  It strikes me that the issue is more closely related to health and safety than the viability of this segment of the fishing industry.  I understand that many of the vessels in question are not covered by the producer organisations through which the Minister suggests they should make representations.  A large section of the fleet is not represented by these organisations.<\/p> <p>  On the specific recommendations, the fleet sub-segmentation lobby group has indicated that in the event that the Minister does not adopt the policy changes it proposes, the Irish fleet would continue to fall behind other fleets in the European Union, the market value of Irish catch would continue to decline owing to fleet inadequacies, Ireland would lose its competitive position on the export market and the whitefish sector would continue to decline and eventually become unviable.  It calls for the introduction of a decommissioning scheme to help the whitefish sector, which would cost the Government and the European Union.  I trust the Minister and his officials are party to the issues raised by the group.   Where does the Minister stand on the specific points the group has raised and the requests it has made?  While I understand the Minister's point that a change in policy would require consultation with all relevant stakeholders, will he indicate whether he agrees or disagrees with the specific recommendations made by the group?<\/p><p>It strikes me that the system employed here is very rigid and cumbersome and more complicated than similar systems in other EU states.  It may well have worked for Ireland up to now, but it is surely time to review the policy with a view to maintaining the livelihood of the fishermen in the polyvalent sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#Q00300","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for engaging with us on this issue.  The current fleet sub-segmentation policy is a ministerial policy and, as such, I assume the Minister can decide to review it on the basis of evidence he has heard and based on the comprehensive business case that was submitted by the vessel owners who are seeking a policy shift.  He can initiate a policy review if he so decides; it does not require a senior official to ask him to do so.  Will the Minister clarify whether he will give active consideration to such a review?<\/p> <p>  I understand the sub-segmentation issue is unique to Ireland among EU fleets.  Moreover, the problem in this regard is specific to one particular sub-segment, namely, the polyvalent pelagic sector.  My understanding is there is plenty of available tonnage in the refrigerated seawater, RSW, pelagic sector and surplus tonnage in the whitefish sector.  However, because of the way the policy works, operators in the polyvalent pelagic sector are not able to access that tonnage, which is all being used up by existing operators.<\/p> <p>  A number of fishermen find themselves in situations which are rightly classed as emergency cases, some of which were outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Another such case of which I am aware involves a vessel owner who is required by the Marine Survey Office, in accordance with a seaworthiness survey, to have a bulbous bow fitted on his craft.  In order to do so, however, he must purchase additional tonnage, which he cannot do because the only tonnage available is whitefish tonnage.  There is a risk, therefore, that he may not be able to get a licence to go back to sea.  Reference was made to another vessel owner who was granted the required tonnage and offered a licence but would, as a consequence, have to be taken out of the sector in which he is fishing.  The case to which I referred is a very pressing one and there are people in a similar situation across the fishing industry.  Even if the Minister does decide to initiate a review, those cases should be dealt with in the meantime, on a one-off basis, to allow people to continue to sustain themselves within the industry.<\/p> <p>  I do not see why the sub-segmentation system should be so rigid.  The policy was introduced in 2003, but sub-segmentation has been going on, as the Minister indicated, since the early 1990s.  Surely no policy should be cast in stone but instead should be subject to periodic review to ensure it continues to meet the requirements that were placed on it at the time it was introduced?  I urge the Minister to address this particular issue.  As other speakers pointed out, there is precedent here by way of the vessel owner who purchased whitefish tonnage in 2011 and was licensed subsequently to continue in the polyvalent pelagic sector.  Dealing with cases like that, at the same time a review is ongoing and a new policy is being drafted, would go a long way to satisfying the concerns of those operators who find themselves in a very difficult situation because of the current provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#R00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

A number of weeks ago we heard a presentation on this issue in Buswell's Hotel during which concern was expressed by those giving the presentation about the safety aspect of this.

I would caution against using that as a precedent.  There were specific circumstances involved, in respect of which we can provide members with the details, if they so wish.  That was not, as is being suggested by some, the Minister interfering and doing a particular job in respect of a particular vessel.  I have a clear record of not dealing with licensing issues in respect of individual vessels because I am not allowed to do so, legally.  That was put in place by a previous Government for good reason and because of the pressures that Ministers were coming under previously to do individual deals in respect of individual vessels.  We need to be careful of that.  I am not saying I do not have an open mind to suggestions because I do, as it happens.  However, I cannot do individual deals in respect of individual vessels; otherwise, I will spend all of my time doing so.  Also, I would need to change the legislation before I could do it.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, what we are talking about here is 18 boats.  What we are being asked is that we would allow people to essentially use whitefish tonnage in kilowatts in order to have bigger boats that are targeting pelagic fish.  Essentially, we are using whitefish capacity to increase the capacity per catch in the pelagic sector, accepting, of course, that the quota does not change.  We need to be careful before we do that.  It is not true to say that somebody cannot replace a wooden boat with a steel boat.  They can if it is the same size.  However, they cannot build a bigger boat without getting extra capacity.<\/p><p>It has been suggested that the pelagic and polyvalent sectors are on their knees but they are not.  Some boats are finding the going tough but some are making a very good living now.  The people who are looking to expand and buy or build bigger boats are in this category, by and large.  It certainly does not suggest a category on its knees if people are looking to build bigger boats.  Let us have an honest conversation.  I want to try to help the industry to make more money and have as many viable fishing boats as we can in the Irish fleet.  I want to get them as much fish to catch as we can.  I also have to balance the fact that we essentially have a whitefish and pelagic fishery, which are quite different, and the way we manage them is quite different.<\/p><p> We had a mackerel review in 2010 that was quite significant.  We had a herring review in 2011 and 2012.  It is not as if we have not had recent reviews in terms of the split and segmentation within different categories.  There was a change in terms of the percentage of mackerel that the refrigerated sea water fleet was catching versus the polyvalent sector.  In the future, we will probably have to review that again.  I would like to see proposals from the fishing industry as a whole so we can get a sense of what the fishing industry is looking for and I can make proposals on the back of that.  I understand what they are saying but there are consequences for many other people in making those changes.  If bigger boats in the polyvalent sector catching mackerel and herring are facilitated, we would be increasing the capacity for catch without increasing the quota available.  We must ask questions as to the likely outcome of somebody having the capacity to catch much more fish but not the quota to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#S00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>There are other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#T00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will allow supplementary questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#T00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>There may be safety issues but there is also the temptation to catch more fish out of quota.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#T00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>They are under quota.

The record of this Government with respect to safety, particularly the money and resources put into it and the changes made, has been fairly strong.  I am glad to say we have had some positive results.  Although there have been some tragedies in the past two years, there has been a big improvement on previous years.  I take safety very seriously.  I have personal and professional experience of the consequences of not giving safety at sea full attention.  I will happily debate with anybody who wishes to question my bona fides around safety.  This issue should not be sold as simply a safety matter, as it is more than that.  If people are to build a bigger boat with the capacity to catch much more fish but people are not allowed to catch more fish, concerns will be raised about the temptation to catch more fish without having the quota to do so.  Essentially, capacity would be taken from the whitefish sector and given to the pelagics without the corresponding change in quota.  Maybe that is the right way to go but I would certainly like to have the views of others in the industry outside of those 18 boats before going ahead to make a proposal.  That is not an unreasonable approach.<\/p> <p>  If this is a slam dunk and the obvious action to take, why are no producer organisations asking for it?  Some of the members know them very well because of where they come from.  No major producer organisation is asking for this at the moment because they cannot get agreement on it.  The Killybegs Fisheries Organisation would certainly get no agreement and the Irish South and West Producers Organisation does not have agreement on it.  My understanding is the organisation in the south and east does not have agreement either.  Let us not paint this as something obvious to be done.  Instead, we can consider it, and I am happy to do so.<\/p><p>If, after there has been a discussion with all stakeholders in the industry, a majority of people say this is the right thing to do, then we will do it.  I do not accept the suggestion we are hearing here today that we should get on with this because it is an obvious thing to do for safety reasons.  I do not think it is as simple as that.  Most people who understand the fishing industry will accept that too.  I have read the letter.  I have it in front of me here.  The key paragraph proposes that permission be granted to use whitefish tonnage, of which there is currently surplus available, on polyvalent pelagic vessels.  Pelagic fishermen would then be enabled to purchase whitefish tonnage and kilowatts in order to effect the necessary modernisation of their pelagic catch.  All I am saying is that while this makes sense on the face of it for some boats, I cannot in all conscience ignore the knock-on consequences it would have for the industry in terms of the sustainability of catch, the availability of quota and all the rest of it.<\/p><p> As I have said, if even one producer organisation came out in support of this proposal along with the group that is here, we could start to build a consensus about what we should be doing.  It is wrong to paint this as the mainstream view of fishermen on the basis that some people are asking for it.  Some people want it for very good commercial and other reasons.  They might want to upgrade their boats or increase their capacity, safety and comfort, etc.  They are perfectly entitled to aspire to all of those things.  I need to make sure we make a decision that in the round is right for fish stocks and for the fishing industry as a whole.  That is all I am saying.  I am not ruling it out but I am not saying that, as Minister, I should pursue the proposal we have here as policy at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#T01000","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I would like to raise three issues.  On the court case, I would appreciate it if the Minister could outline for us in writing the circumstances of the decision made by the Department in this instance.  What did the court say?  I understand that if the court told the Minister to do something, he had to do it.  If the regulations as they were written at the time did not allow him to do so, he would have had to amend the regulations to make it happen.  In other words, if the court tells the Minister to do something, that does not give him dispensation from law in doing it.  He is obliged to change the law so that he can do what he is required to do legally.  I ask the Minister to give us a comprehensive explanation of how this was done.  If it was possible to do it without a change in the regulation in one case, it should be possible to do it in similar cases.  I am curious about it.  I am not asking for a detailed explanation today, but I would appreciate it if such an explanation could be forwarded to us and this particular issue could be addressed in it.<\/p> <p>  The second issue I would like to raise relates to wooden boats, which were mentioned by the Minister.  Does he agree it is time to take larger wooden boats out of the system for safety reasons?  Does he accept that if a wooden boat is replaced by a steel boat with the same external dimensions, extra tonnage and kilowatts will be needed?  As steel is much thinner than timber, its internal dimensions will be larger.  My understanding is that the measurement goes by the inside.  Basically, I understand that if a steel boat and a wooden boat are the same size, the steel boat requires more tonnage.<\/p> <p>  The third issue I wish to mention is that in many of these cases, the extra tonnage that is being added is not significant.  It is actually quite minuscule.  The least the Minister can do is deal with the three issues we have mentioned, namely, the replacement of tonnage, the purchase of boats that are more or less the same size but might be slightly larger and the question of the changes demanded by the Marine Survey Office to comply with safety requirements - in the old days, this would have been seen as safety tonnage - making the technical size of the boat bigger.  We need to be clear about the case that is being made.<\/p><p> I also do not follow the argument about the Minister creating the capacity.  The total capacity of the fishing fleet will stay the same, because the amount of tonnage and kilowatts in the fishing fleet in its totality will stay the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#U00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It is moving from whitefish to pelagic.

The reason for quotas is that the capacity to fish far exceeds the allowed quota, so I do not consider that to be a valid argument.<\/p> <p>  To move this forward, a proposal has been made.  When one looks at the MSO requirements, replacing timber boats with steel boats and so forth, there is a very valid case.  It is only a small segment but that is because most people moved to steel boats in the past.  Is the Minister willing to move this process forward by some means, and not wait for some PO to come forward with a proposal?  I do not believe he will get agreement among the producer organisations, POs.  I believe they are wishing for the Minister to take the initiative here, to be brave and say he will start the process.  Would the Minister consider writing to each PO to say that he has received this document, that he is anxious to find out from them what their response would be to the document submitted and whether they would, with or without conditions, support or object to the proposal involved, which basically is bringing tonnage and kilowatts from the whitefish fleet into the polyvalent segment?<\/p> <p>  As I said, this might be very limited; it might be 10% or 20% of a polyvalent boat.  It is not about bringing it in wholesale as it could be limited.

As I understand it, there are 31 or 33 vessels in the polyvalent pelagic sector, which means a majority of vessels in the sector affected is requesting this.  That surely should carry some weight within the decision-making process.  I understand the Department's concerns that if a vessel is allowed to increase its stability at sea and its ability to go to sea in certain weather conditions, the next step would be that it would look for additional quota.  On that basis, one would never do anything and the Department would never allow anything to happen.  Fishermen will look for additional quota.  I do not see it as a valid reason not to do something.  If somebody puts a bulbous bow on their vessel, for example, that will not all of a sudden create the capacity to catch an extra 200 tonnes of mackerel a year.<\/p> <p>  I know of situations where boats were unable to go to sea because of weather conditions and were not able to catch their mackerel quota until very late in the season.  In order to make their quota, they had to steam for 17 or 18 hours from their home port.  Surely that is not a good situation for those boats.  It could lead to them going to sea in weather for which the vessels are not fit.  We have seen tragic cases like that in the past, unfortunately, when fishermen have gone to sea in bad weather because of the need to catch quota.

There will be practical complexities.  I refer to the Celtic Sea, which is often used as an example because it is a good one, where fishermen are catching cod, haddock and whiting.  Whiting is separate as it is a slightly different shape from cod and haddock.  It will be complicated over the next three or four years to introduce an obligation to land for each of those species.  We are starting with whiting, which is the easiest one to start with.  There is a slightly cleaner whiting fishery in part of the Celtic Sea than for cod and haddock.  The feedback from the industry and stakeholders was that whiting is the easiest of the three species to start with.  That is what we are trying to do.  Given what we have learned from the scientific observation this year, we will work through next year to try to do as good a job as we can on the obligation to land for whiting.  We will learn lessons from that and then we will introduce another species.  We will do it step by step.  We will help fishermen with the cost of changing gear to become more selective.  Obviously, that will impact on mesh size, the shape of nets, escape hatches and so on.<\/p><p>It will be quite challenging to deal with the prawn fishery, but there are known mechanisms to create a cleaner fishery, such as the Swedish grid and a number of separation systems of cod and prawns that have been used in the Irish Sea quite successfully.  There are approaches that can make the problem easier to deal with.  In the Celtic Sea, we increased the mesh size and we introduced technical conservation measures, which actually reduced the discard of juvenile fish by 40% in the past two years.  This can be done.  As a result, the stock should be healthier the following year.  The whole point of this is to build up stocks.<\/p><p>Deputy Pringle said the <i>de minimis <\/i>rule is 7% to 8%, but to be clear, the rule is 7% at a maximum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#AA00100","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Is it going to go down to that level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015063000002#AA00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Policing that will be a challenge, of course.

This is my first time before a parliamentary committee in Ireland and it is a real pleasure.  I have been a member of select committees in the UK Parliament for the past ten years but am here in my capacity as the chair of the cross-party Save the Pub Group, which I established with other Members from all political parties back in 2009.  We did that because we were concerned about the rate of pub closures in the United Kingdom and the reasons behind that.  A document I have to hand for circulation to members is the mission statement we published as an all-party group in 2009, which would provide members with a sense of our work on some issues on which we have been campaigning.  I have taken a real interest in this issue and have become something of a champion for these issues.  Clearly, the joint committee's particular interest is the economic impact of measures governments can take which are pub-friendly and that can have a direct effect on jobs and I will restrict my comments to those areas in the five minutes allotted to me.<\/p> <p>  It is important to state, before so doing, that while there are huge similarities between pubs in the United Kingdom and the Irish pub and the role it plays in the community and nation of Ireland, there also are highly significant differences between the pub sector in the two countries and it is important to bear that in mind.  When it comes to the issue of jobs and economic impact in particular, we are looking at the taxation policies and this has been a real focus for us as group in recent years.  I am well aware of the double whammy here in Ireland with the 23% VAT rate on alcoholic drinks, which is offset slightly by the 9% VAT rate on the hospitality industry.  Incidentally, that is something for which we are campaigning in the United Kingdom but for which we are not meeting with any success thus far.  As members are aware, we have been successful with regard to beer excise duty.  Until recent changes in the United Kingdom, the two countries have had among the very highest beer excise duties.  Moreover, through organisations like the British Beer and Pub Association and the Campaign for Real Ale, CAMRA, members should please follow up with me regarding any information they seek and I will provide factual information to them from the various surveys.  However, it was clear from surveys that the price of a pint in the on-trade in pubs was causing a decline because it was making it less attractive to go to the pubs.  Moreover, while the beer excise rises through the beer duty escalator, which we have had in place for a number of years, was also affecting the off-trade and supermarkets, the latter in particular were able to absorb them and often did not increase their prices at all.  Consequently, after a long-fought campaign, we managed to have the beer duty escalator abolished and since then, we have had two further cuts in beer duty.  We actually have achieved a cut in beer duty.  I will provide the joint committee with some research, as ultimately one must be able to back up one's facts, and research was carried out before the third and most recent cut in beer duty by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, which I will happily share with members.  It is estimated that 26,000 jobs were created from the abolition of the beer duty escalator alone, which is highly significant.  A lot of those jobs are in brewing, as opposed to pubs because clearly, the tax is levied at the producer level but many medium-sized breweries, in particular, were unable to invest in their plants and staff.<\/p><p>The abolition of the duty escalator has also led to higher investment.  It is estimated that in 2014 investment was &pound;61 million higher than it would have been if the duty escalator had been maintained and the price of a pint was 16 pence lower before the third cut in beer duty than it would have been under a beer duty escalator.  This has led to 750 million more pints being sold in the on-trade and clearly this increase has had a significant effect.  These estimates were calculated before the third beer duty and further research will be done on the effects of the duty cuts which have provided further significant and good news. <\/p><p> The other issue directly related to pubs is the business rate relief which has been extended to pubs, although the Save the Pub Group would like it to be directly focused on pubs.  <\/p><p> There is clear, cold, hard evidence that the reduction in beer duty to a much more competitive level in the United Kingdom compared to European competitors has had a direct effect, not only on helping to restore confidence in the pub sector but also in terms of further investment and direct jobs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Mulholland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Mulholland and Mr. Cribben.

Will Mr. Mulholland outline how it operates?<\/p> <p>  While we all agree with Mr. Mulholland on duty and excise, the position of the off-trade versus the on-trade is another important issue and one which Mr. Mulholland did not discuss in detail.

Members should not worry as I do not propose to do so.  The Deputy asked about the Save the Pub Group.  I am visiting Ireland to share the group's experience and potentially make contacts.  I visited the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly to discuss the possibility of similar groups being formed and it is wonderful that the next place I am visiting is the Republic of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that Ireland does not have a system of all-party parliamentary groups.  We are a formal all-party parliamentary group which is constituted through the rules pertaining to all-party parliamentary groups, which have a certain number of Members of Parliament from the various parties.  We have officers selected along those lines.  Ultimately, we set ourselves up as a campaigning group with a specific set of aims.  I have our 2010 remit, which leads me nicely on.  I will read briefly from the purpose and mission statement of the group.  It states that the purpose of the Save the Pub Group is to \"bring together Members of the House of Commons and House of Lords who want to add their voice to the efforts to preserve and protect the British pub\".  The group shares a belief that \"British pubs are important to the country's history and heritage and are hugely important to the communities they serve\".<\/p> <p>  To pick up on another point the Deputy made, the Save the Pub Group also believes that the traditional public house provides a sociable and controlled drinking environment, which is important in encouraging responsible and sociable drinking.  We continue to push this message strongly as it is one that has been lost to a great extent to both nations.<\/p><p> We have not agreed a policy on supermarket pricing because there are different views on that thorny issue.  The price differential is very significant and surveys show people are opting to drink at home because of the very low prices available in supermarkets.  My own view is that below-cost selling of alcohol is entirely wrong.  I have pushed the Government in the UK and its predecessor to deal with the issue, and we have had some success in so far as legislation was passed.  However, that legislation does not really deal with the problem because it is effectively concerned only with taxation issues, without any reference to the cost of production and distribution of the product.  I am still pushing both Government and industry to come up with a workable below-cost selling ban.  We have considered minimum pricing, which I understand is also under consideration here, but that brings one into the realm of having to decide what level to choose and considerations such as whether it is an arbitrary level and whether what is being done is punitive.  While we all want to encourage responsible drinking, we do not want something that is deliberately punitive.  We will continue to push on that particular issue.<\/p><p> The assets of community value, ACV, scheme which was introduced in Britain by the last Parliament under the Localism Act is an interesting initiative that gives communities the ability to seek to list not only pubs but also local shops and other community facilities.  So far, the number of pubs listed is not huge, at between 600 and 700, although it has gone up in the past few months.  Communities must go through a listing submission process with the local authority and applications are sometimes turned down.  However, the opportunity is there to put a community bid together.  It is a fairly weak power in that the bid can be ignored, but it does present something of a roadblock to those situations where a local pub is lost without communities having a say.  One of the greatest problems in terms of pub closures in the UK is the situation where supermarket chains are buying pubs, including profitable pubs, simply because they want to impose a store on local communities.  We have absurd permitted development rights which allow that use class to go through without the need for planning permission and with communities having no say.  Where indebted property companies own pubs, it often suits their needs to sell them, even where they are profitable and viable concerns.  The ACV scheme was partly brought in to deal with that particular threat, but we are still campaigning for greater protection and an end to all permitted development rights.<\/p><p> Ireland is very lucky not to have this type of issue with property companies, which has proved a disastrous economic experiment in the UK.  It was essentially a scam and is, in fact, referred to by many campaigners as the \"Great British Pubco Scam\".  It came out of an attempt to facilitate more competition for consumers through the introduction of beer orders back in 1989, at a time when the six largest brewers had a stranglehold on the market.  The situation in Britain is very different from that in Ireland in that we have many smaller brewers, including very small brewers, who were struggling to access markets.  It was the right thing to do to try to tackle that but, unfortunately, there was no restriction on non-brewing companies.  As a consequence, large pub companies were set up which did not brew beer and which proceeded to buy up thousands of pubs.  The problem is that they then borrowed money against an overvalued estate, that is, an asset with an artificial value.  When the property market collapsed, it proved disastrous, with the two largest pub-owning companies now in billions of pounds of debt.  That is a significant problem which the sector in Ireland does not face, although there are, of course, different issues here.<\/p><p> The introduction of beer duty would not automatically result in lots of pubs being able to stay open.  However, it would send a strong signal that governments and parliamentarians value pubs.  It is easy to say how much we value pubs and the brewing industry's great products, including, in Ireland's case, the great Irish whiskeys and stouts.<\/p><p>Putting those things into practice is often something that Ministers are more reluctant to do.  The experience of beer duty in the UK is that it does restore confidence among businesspeople.  There were huge celebrations among licensees and trade representatives following the abolition of the beer duty escalator three years ago and the first cut in beer duty and a sense that this was, perhaps, doing a lot to stem the decline in the British pub sector.  One of the exciting things for Ireland is that because it has a much less complicated pub sector with, generally, freehold ownership, as long as producers commit to pass on any reduction in excise duty - I am sure they would do so because it is in their interests to do so - this will have a direct and predictable benefit for the producing-brewing sector.  I note, although this relates only to a small part of the market, that as in the case of the rest of the western world the craft beer market is now opening up in Ireland.<\/p><p> The only issue we had with the beer duty was that the property companies, because they were in huge debt, would pocket any reductions in beer duty.  We had to really push to ensure this did not happen.  Ireland does not have that problem and, as such, it will be able to ensure a more sensible and reasonable level of beer duty, which will have a much more positive economic effect on beer producers and will then be passed down directly through the chain to individual licensees and the customer, which is crucial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Mulholland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Mulholland and Mr. Cribben to the committee and thank Mr. Mulholland for his presentation.  Mr. Mulholland referred in his opening remarks to the many similarities between the UK and Irish pub trade, particularly the rural pub sector, although I am not too familiar with rural UK.  I am sure the witnesses are aware that the laws in relation to drink driving and so on have been tightened up over the past number of years.

Rural pubs is a particular concern in Ireland, particularly in the context of the tourist appeal of the Irish pub in many areas.  We have not pursued the possibilities of taxi licences for pubs or schemes in terms of designated drivers and so on, although I think that is a measure it would be interesting to look at in relation to rural areas.  What has happened in the UK, and I think is worth looking at, is the Pub is the Hub scheme, which is not a Government initiative but it is supported by Government.  It is a charity supported by a number of organisations which works with communities, villages and licensees to enable them to diversify their business, adding new things such as shops and so on.  It is ironic that we are now moving towards the old Irish model of the grocer and pub being co-located, which is not something we did in the past in the UK.  We are trying to enable diversification, including in relation to post offices in the context of the recent threat to that sector.   I would suggest the committee look at the work of Pub is the Hub, in respect of which I am happy to facilitate links.<\/p> <p>  Also, there has been a presumption in planning law to seek to protect a last pub in a village.<\/p><p>Clearly, there are villages that may have had two, three or four pubs, and once it is down to one pub, it is in planning guidance in the UK that the pub should have greater protection than other pubs, and that is clearly sensible.  It is not an absolute and perhaps it could go further.<\/p><p> It is important to say, on the other side of that coin, that sometimes the so-called pub and beer industry in both countries must accept that pubs will not always be great direct income generators, and there are some areas where the pub may only provide a living for someone and their family.  It may not be at all appealing to a larger company or suppliers.  It is important to look at the community worth and the fact that pubs are still contributing very significantly and directly to local communities.  In the UK we have figures from the British Beer and Pub Association indicating that every pound spent in a pub provides twice the value to the local economy of a pound spent in a supermarket.  People who run bed and breakfasts and local shops tell us that if a pub closes, it makes a village less attractive and it is damaging to tourism, so more must be done to ensure there are ways, through some initiatives that we are implementing and that are being implemented here, to help pubs to survive.<\/p><p> We have seen a very exciting increase in community pubs, and that has not yet happened here.  The Plunkett Foundation helps communities to put a bid together and formulate various models to run a pub, including but not limited to co-operatives.  There are now some thriving community pubs, and some of these may not make more than a wage for the person behind the bar, although that may be enough for that person and their family.  It could become a viable public house for the future and, crucially, it will continue to help the wider economy; it will still encourage people to use the bed and breakfasts, hotels and other tourist attractions.  Without the pub, the place would suffer, and then we would be on a very dangerous downward spiral.  It would be useful to bring some of those ideas together.<\/p><p> On the beer duty question, the answer is, \"I do not believe so.\"  The figures I have provided are national figures.  I can speak to the people in the Campaign for Real Ale, CAMRA, and the British Beer and Pub Association to see if any regional figures are being pulled together.  If they have been, I will certainly be happy to share them with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Mulholland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>It is interesting to hear the Mr. Mulholland's point of view.  I must admit my own bias, as I have been in the supermarket business all my life.  I have listened to him being \"anti-supermarket\" in almost everything he said.  Britain and Ireland have the highest alcohol prices in Europe, to the best of my knowledge.  It seems to me that if we are going to encourage competition, we really should be encouraging supermarkets to sell alcohol rather than discouraging that.  Mr. Mulholland has advocated a campaign of saying \"No,\" and is almost saying that those who run supermarkets are very nasty people who cut prices, sell below cost, etc.  I argue that this is in the interests of the community and the community needs an interest such as that.  Competition is very useful and should continue.  We love to have pubs, by all means, but they must adjust to compete with supermarkets.  The public wants the best value, and that does not just mean price; it is price plus spirit, choice and service.  I can go back 50 years to a time when there was not such choice.  Supermarkets have done a marvellous job in bringing in that choice.

I am not anti-supermarket in the same way that I am not against pub companies.  I am against abusive practices, and we can see a host of abusive practices by pub companies.<\/p><p>Legislation is now in place to deal with some of those practices which are anti-competitive.  When any large company gets such a dominant position and has such resources that it can bully everyone else out of business, be they dairy farmers or communities, that is anti-competitive practice.  Supermarkets that open up in a market town and encourage the closure of village shops in order that there is no competition clearly represent anti-competitive practice.  I am not trying to put the genie back in the bottle.  There are those in the UK, and they are almost all licensees, who would say it would be great if we could turn the clock back to when supermarkets were not allowed to do this and we had off-licences and off-licences off-sales of alcohol but that is not going to happen.  We must be realistic.  It is a bit like the smoking ban, which most people think is a positive development, although it has damaged some pubs.  That ban will not be reversed either.  It is anti-competitive to sell alcohol below cost, to sell it at a cheaper price than bottled water.  That is irresponsible and immoral.  If people are playing fair and the price comes down to competition, that is great, but when that is not the case and such a strategy is deliberately used simply because people can afford to do so, that is not great.  It is not competitive and it is not proper business.  <\/p><p> Regarding my comments about supermarkets, particularly the imposition of supermarkets in a building that was a pub and often one that has been there for many years and was wanted by a community, one can say that is the supermarket's fault but it is not as it comes down to the weakness of the British planning system, which is what we have been saying.  Companies will exploit weaknesses in law and regulation, which is why we need to tighten up, improve and change the law and regulation.  I am happy to get a good priced, decent quality, bottle of wine at a supermarket, so that is not an issue.  The issue is that if instead of encouraging young people, as they are growing up, to go out with their father, mother or grandfather to enjoy a pint in a pub in a sociable responsible atmosphere, we go down the route of having very cut-price alcohol sales, which is simply seen as a means to get intoxicated and is not associated with sociable atmosphere, that can be dangerous.  That does not represent competition.  It is not what the supermarkets may intend.  The licensed trade in every country is always the most regulated sector of business, and it should be.  The supermarkets are not sufficiently considering the amount of alcohol that they retail.  We must be honest about that.  I do not want to stop them selling alcohol, nor do I support a high minimum price in the way that some of the health lobby do to have punitive pricing.  The evidence shows that does not make a big difference to problem drinkers.  That is not the way forward either.  However, we need to stop below-cost selling of alcohol and in the UK we certainly need to deal with the planning issues and those issues are related to planning rather than being anti-supermarket.  It will mean that people will get the chance to have a say if they want their pub to be turned into a supermarket without it being decided in two head offices of two giant companies both based hundreds of miles away.  Such strategies are anti-community and often anti-competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Mulholland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have some knowledge of this issue as I was close to setting up a craft brewery about 15 years ago and I have done considerable research on the sector although some of it is a little old at this stage.<\/p> <p>  With respect to a supplier power structure in Ireland, there is quite a degree of supplier power here in that there is a small number of suppliers in general and they exert considerable influence over their customers.  The position was worse a number of years ago, even to the point that many pubs were fearful of taking on taps from some of the craft breweries in that they would get less attractive contracts and deals from the larger breweries.  However, that has subsided somewhat at this stage.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with what Mr. Mulholland said.  Alcohol is a special type of product in that it has great social uses but it also has great social dangers, so it has to be treated slightly differently from other types of products.<\/p><p>My view is that the on-trade market is far more attractive for many reasons.  There is greater safety in the consumption of the products and there is added social value.

In respect of the tied structure, I believe the healthiest market structure in this area would be perfect competition between the pubs themselves and perfect competition between the suppliers.  In other words, there would be a large number of independent suppliers and pubs.  That would be best for the consumer as it would create diversity, variety and good competition on price and quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#J00200","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435667400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Those are some very good questions.  The Deputy's last point is very interesting.  One could imagine a fantasy pub sector with the Irish pub ownership structure, which is nearly all freehold, and the British beer sector, which is booming and enjoying huge competition.  There are small breweries knocking on pub doors and new breweries opening every month, yet many of them cannot get into the large pub companies because they cannot afford to sell at the very low prices those pubs insist on.  Often, breweries cannot afford to sell even in their local village, if none of the pubs there is freehold.  It is a stark contrast.<\/p> <p>  I am interested to hear about the Deputy's experience of craft brewing; perhaps he was 15 years too early as it is all the rage now.  It was Gordon Brown who brought in the progressive beer duty - the small brewers rate relief - which started a resurgence at the bottom end of the British brewing industry.  The growth has been quite remarkable.  In September 2014, for which I have the figures here, there were 1,285 breweries in the UK, the vast majority of which were in Great Britain with more in England than anywhere else.  To plug my own area, west Yorkshire has the single largest concentration of breweries of any county in the country.<\/p> <p>  The range of beer being brewed now is extraordinary.  The majority of it is still cask ale, although there is a new trend for craft keg beer, which is more akin to the craft beer brewed over here or to American-style beer.  British brewing has been going through the most extraordinary resurgence in quality and quantity.<\/p><p>That type of beer nearly died out in the 1970s through the dominance of the large brewing companies at the time.  They decided to turn away from the traditional cask conditioned product for cheaper keg versions of the British bitters.  Lager also became a popular drink, as it did here.  At the same time we have seen the decline of the pubs.<\/p><p> It is not entirely popular, it must be said, because some of the medium sized brewers do not believe it is fair that they do not get any relief.  There are some calls to make it a sliding scale, so everybody gets relief on the first quantity of beer that they brew and one does not get this cliff edge, which can prove a disincentive for some brewers to expand from being a micro brewer to being a medium sized brewer.  Clearly, one does not wish to have anything in taxation that produces a disincentive to grow but it is important to have that so we will continue to have the quality and choice of beer.  Incidentally, it is now generally produced far closer to the pubs that serve it, which is more environmentally friendly.  Also, there is a trend among people both here and in the UK to want local produce of all types, and that is to be welcomed.<\/p><p> That is the significant thing that has been done.  There has not really been a promotion of craft beer.  Governments would say that they support brewing and the current and last governments would say that the biggest way they did that and showed confidence in British beer was through cuts in beer duty.  It was very significant in terms of the message it conveyed and the confidence it produced in the sector.<\/p><p> There is far less linkage with the lucrative scotch whisky industry and the on-trade, although it is clearly a big seller in the on-trade.  Most of the focus from the UK Government tends to be on exports rather than promoting it in the on-trade and, indeed, there are always efforts in supporting the Scottish whisky industry in that regard.<\/p><p> With regard to business rates, the small business rate relief being extended has certainly helped many pubs.  The Save the Pub Group would like to see, potentially through the assets of community value initiative, a specific rate relief given to community pubs where the community pub can show that it has that role in the community, as genuine community pubs do in that it supports charitable work, community organisations and sports teams.  It is necessary to find a way of doing that but we would like to see something specific in the rates system in the UK.<\/p><p> A campaign was launched recently to try to address the high business rates that many pubs are charged, and the Save the Pub Group has pledged to support it.  Clearly, business rates is a big issue for many UK publicans.  There is something of an irony here because it is being led by the British Beer and Pub Association, which is the representative body of the big players, the large pub companies and large breweries.  The irony is that it was the British Beer and Pub Association which put the current rates regime in place by proposing it in the first place.  At the time, it was a way of enabling the pub-owning companies to take a greater share of the income from the pub.  Now, it works very significantly against licensees.  That is one of the ironies from that debacle, but we are keen and we will work with that association and others to try to get a fairer system of rates which, as the member said, more directly reflects the income and the profit in the pub.  The current very complex system, on which I can share more information with the committee, does not do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Mulholland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I wish Mr. Cribben the best of luck in his ongoing talks with the LVA.  The next time he appears before the committee there might be a joint body rather than two separate bodies.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a couple of points.<\/p><p>I have always been opposed to below-cost selling because the manner in which many below-cost sellers, including supermarkets, are taking advantage of the VAT rebate means that taxpayers are indirectly subsidising the drink.  I am delighted that we have introduced legislation to provide for a minimum cost for each unit of alcohol.  I am aware that a similar arrangement is in place in Scotland, but does Mr. Mulholland envisage that it will be extended to the entire UK as a means of controlling the sale of alcohol in supermarkets?<\/p><p> I must say that what is happening here on the craft beer side of things is really exciting.  Many micro-breweries are producing craft beer in various locations throughout the country.  In fairness to the Minister, in the last budget he increased the number of hectolitres that can be produced before additional excise duty needs to be paid.  That has been welcomed by the craft brewers that are found all over the country.<\/p><p> I travel to Mr. Mulholland's part of Yorkshire once a year for a race meeting in York.  I have noticed that for more and more pubs in the UK, the food business is as important as the drink business.  I see that happening here as well.  Perhaps, as part of a cultural shift, people are getting used to eating out rather than cooking.  Does Mr. Mulholland have any thoughts on how we can improve and increase that business?  As a certain skill set is needed, we need to consider how we can address the shortage of chefs in this country.  I am sure that problem is being encountered within the food-serving pub trade in the UK as well.<\/p><p> I agree with Mr. Mulholland that many pubs are merely surviving.  In many cases, the problem is where they are located.  I understand there was a time when there were more pubs than houses in Dunmore, County Galway.  That has changed dramatically in recent years.  There has been a rationalisation of the trade and a shift in the culture.  I see this in my own town of Naas as well.  There are just six or eight pubs there now, whereas there were 15 or 20 pubs in the town ten or 15 years ago.  Based on his experience in the UK, how does Mr. Mulholland believe we can address the problem of pubs closing down in certain areas?  How can we make a change so that pubs are more likely to operate on a vibrant community basis, in the manner to which he has alluded, rather than being lost to their communities?  If a post office is closing people will protest outside it, but very little notice is taken when a pub is closing, even though in most rural areas it is the link that enables people to communicate with one another.  We do not see that happening.  Does Mr. Mulholland agree we could be doing something on that to encourage more of them to stay open?  It may be possible to link in with other services as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#L00200","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435667400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>The Deputy has made a number of interesting and important points.  I will be watching with interest to see what happens here with regard to below-cost selling.  The debate on that is still raging, including within the sector.  There are people within the so-called industry who are absolutely opposed to a prohibition on below-cost selling because potentially they could benefit from sales.  Some producers are less opposed to it because they object to supermarkets being able to sell their products at a price that they consider to be too low.  There is generally strong support for a ban from licensees.  The problem in this regard lies in how one picks the minimum price.  For that reason, I hope we will work towards a genuine definition of what it means to sell below cost.  I think the costs of production and distribution should be taken into account, as should taxation.  I believe that would help us to stamp out the very low-price sale of alcohol in supermarkets without necessarily picking an arbitrary figure.<\/p><p>Doctors would like it to be pitched at a very high level because they believe that would put people off drinking or they would drink less.  Not only does that not necessarily help some problem drinkers, even though it might reduce consumption, there is a danger that it could damage pubs if it is too high a figure.<\/p><p> I share the point on the VAT rebate.  It is a scandal and needs to be highlighted more.  In terms of craft beer, it was very interesting to hear that Ireland is going down the route of doing something similar to what we call the progressive beer duty for smaller producers.  I am interested in seeing what impact that has because there is a global move towards locally produced craft beers.  No one will threaten the dominance of Guinness in Ireland but people want choice, and there is no reason there cannot be a range of different types of beer.  That is to be encouraged.<\/p><p> The issue of food is interesting because food is much more important to many pubs than it used to be, in particular rural pubs in the UK which serve Sunday lunches and other meals.  That is to be welcomed and I am not aware that there is a shortage of chefs, but there is a crisis in curry houses in the UK because of changes to the immigration rules which mean we may not have enough qualified chefs for our curry houses.  If one goes to a pub in the UK that does not do food, one might go from the pub to a curry house.  <\/p><p> Deputy Lawlor referred to visiting York, which is a fascinating example of what is happening.  It is a very popular tourist destination.  Pubs are opening there in locations which were not formerly pubs, and the same is happening in Leeds and a number of other places.  There are various reasons for that.  A Leeds brewery opened a new pub in York in recent years.  People often find they cannot get their hands on pubs owned by large companies, even if they are not doing particularly well, and often buy a shop which they convert into a pub.  That is strange, at a time when other pubs are closing.  <\/p><p> There has been a large increase in micro pubs for that reason.  If one buys a shop, one pays significantly less in rates because of the size of the building.  One can have a fairly small bar, which is often more akin to a traditional Irish bar, with a counter and a limited offering that does not include food.  Such pubs are very successful.  In the UK debate is shifting.  It is not true to say that a pub cannot do well unless it serves food.  Certain pubs are reliant on food, but it is exciting that there are now many smaller pubs which do not serve food and do better for not doing so because they specialise in beer and people go to them for that reason.  There needs to be a balance and that depends on a particular pub.<\/p><p> On the question of pub closures, it is about giving a community the opportunity to seek to save a pub.  That means finding someone else to run it or running it themselves.  In Ireland the challenge, because of pubs being freehold, is that if a family decides they no longer wish to run a pub and want to turn it into a house that can be more problematic than a distant pub company which people may not like or know deciding to close a pub against the will of the community.  That is why the assets community value initiative is interesting.  It gives a community the right, not necessarily to buy a pub, but to have a say and to seek to put a community bid together.  <\/p><p> It is a very complex sector in the UK and there are many positive stories.  I mentioned a brewery in Leeds.  Many such small breweries are taking on pubs, and are actively seeking to do so because they are doing very well.  They are often prevented from doing so because of the ludicrous amounts property owning companies seek to sell them for, and that is why they are often sold to Tesco, Sainsbury's or the Co-op.<\/p><p>There are people, certainly in the UK, who are prepared to take on pubs that other companies have deemed non-viable.  All we are arguing for is that the process be seen through: if someone wants to take on a pub and can barter a fair and market price they should be allowed to do so.  That is something we are pushing for.  With those rural pubs, there is a need for some provision in the planning laws to prevent it from closing if it is the only pub in the village.  That is an issue that would have to be worked through within the realities of Irish planning law, an area in which I am not expert.  The pub is a hub initiative.  It should be possible to get more services into a pub - to combine it with a shop, a post office and so on - and to work together with other businesses and get support, mainly from local councils, with some government-backed schemes.  We need to ensure these pubs do not close in the first place because they are so important for the wider economy in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Mulholland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors.

As I have made clear, I am pleased that the pub has a future that is not necessarily in the form of a pub restaurant.  It is a little bit similar to how things are in Ireland: when we use the word \"pub,\" this can cover some things that are substantially different.  Some of the figures that are bandied about include bars, which we in the pub sector group would not necessarily recognise as being pubs or having that intrinsic community value.  Food is important in pubs, but it is great that there are many pubs that are doing well without it, focusing on the beer side of things.  They may well have snacks and pork pies and so on but they are not food-led.<\/p> <p>  There are often grumbles about various elements of red tape and regulation.  I am probably not the best person to speak to from that point of view in the sense that I represent a campaigning organisation, not a licensee representative body.  I can certainly seek organisations that could give the committee that information.  I am not aware of a huge number of complaints about problems serving food in pubs.  It is certainly something that companies of all sizes that own pubs encourage their licensees to do.  With regard to individual pubs, ultimately, pubs are competing against each other, unless they are the last pub in the village, and even then they still need to attract people.  Clearly, they are businesses that need to attract people. The pubs that is getting it right is providing the customer with what he or she wants in terms of the range and quality of beer but also the ambience.<\/p><p>Often, if it is a food-led pub, it is the quality of the food, be it simple Sunday lunch fare or something more fancy.  There are some fantastic operators in the United Kingdom, as there are here.<\/p><p> It has been frustrating to see a real problem in the UK with the lease-tied system, which is operated in particular by large companies.  This is something Ireland does not have, and it goes back to the issue of competition.  I have seen many heartbreaking examples in which people have worked extremely hard, been very good operators and provided what the customers wanted but not got the support from the pub-owning company, and the price of success was to see their rent go up, so that however hard they worked, they could not make the pub sustainable on the terms under which they were being offered it.  We legislated in November last as a result of our big campaign and we hope that will start to become a practice of the past.  We want to see these great operators doing well and really making an effort to attract customers in so that they choose to go to the pubs rather than, as was stated here, choosing to sit at home and watch a DVD with a four-pack of lager.  There is work to be done by operators, by everyone in the trade and, to some extent, by governments, both national and local, to get the message out that well-run responsible pubs are important for tourism, for the economy and for communities and should be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Mulholland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435667400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulholland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015063000002#P00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435667400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>If I may, Senator Mullins's last question deserved an answer.  He asked what would I bring over to the United Kingdom from Irish bars.  I dare say we will visit at least a few Dublin pubs later on and I hope I will come back and visit some pubs in rural areas, as I did some years ago.  One of the wonderful aspects is the difference between the two countries, which is all about history in the end.  It is due to the very different ways in which pubs emerged.  The public house in the United Kingdom emerged from people literally opening up their front rooms to allow others to drink there to supplement their income.  One forgets that it was not a big industry; it was to supplement their income.  Then there is way the Irish pub developed, with the spirit grocers and so on.  There is nothing better than going into a traditional Irish bar where one has a group - generally, but I hope now not always, men - just sitting in conversation at the bar.  In previous times they would have been smoking, but not now.  It is the ambience created by that.  There are a few very basic pubs or bars in the United Kingdom and, certainly, that is the sort of thing I love.<\/p> <p>  One point I must make is that, despite my being the chairman of the Save the Pub group in the United Kingdom, there is no pub called the Mulholland Bar or the Mulholland Arms, whereas in Ireland there are quite a few.  I have not yet visited one.  Something I would certainly like to import is a pub called Mulholland.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the best aspects of the English pub, and the uniqueness of those I call \"English\" specifically, I particularly love mid-terrace locals.  One of my own locals is mid-terrace.  It is literally a terraced house between other terraced houses.  One would not get that anywhere else.  It has a certain quality.  Another is a beautiful pub garden in an English pub in one of the attractive rural areas.  That is something we do particularly well.  However, there are always things that we can learn.  We must make these linkages so that we learn the best things in the pub sector.

I spoke on this on Second Stage and I outlined my reasons but for the benefit of the committee, I will reiterate my views.  It is assumed that the vacant site levy will get at developers hoarding land.  That is all very well where there is a housing need, as we know there is.  However, this will impact on ordinary people who may have a site that is under-utilised.  In some cases, they may not be able to get a loan to do it up, or there may not be a market for the particular property, because a shortage of housing is not a problem in every part of the country.  In my constituency, the local authority has long-term voids that are almost derelict.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with one sentiment expressed by previous speakers.  In some cases, the local authorities do not have money but equally there are ordinary individuals, private property owners, who have inherited properties.  It might be an old family home belonging to parents in the centre of town.  They might not have money to do it up and the market that prevails may mean they cannot sell it.  Why should they be penalised when the local authority will not be penalised?<\/p>  <p>  The one great benefit of this will be that it will bring a certain sobriety to an overzealous county manager who has plans for housing or regeneration and might decide to slap vacant site levies on private property owners without the same measure applying to the local authority itself.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  There must be more sympathy for the ordinary individual who might be put in an unforeseen and unintentional predicament.  The sentiment of providing more housing and developing under-utilised land is good but there are people who could be caught out by this.  <\/p>  <p>  This measure will bring more sobriety to any deliberations by a council which might think it can shove a major responsibility onto private property owners without considering the ramifications for that property owner.  It will consider it if it has to face the same ramifications.  The issue of local authorities not having the means to develop sites is an issue but it is also one which a private person might face, so this measure is welcome.  My only question is about who will levy the council.  The council has its own budget, so to whom will it pay the levy and how will that be implemented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#B00400","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  We might pose the question as to why we have the vacant site levy at all.  This Bill is targeted at incentivising urban regeneration and the provision of housing in core areas of our cities and towns.  We must start where infrastructure already exists.  We all know cities and towns in this country that have sites in their centres which have public services on the footpaths outside them and which have been lying vacant for many years while pressure is coming on the suburbs of those same towns and cities for development.  Pressure is being put on the taxpayer to provide infrastructure and services when we should be focused on regenerating and redeveloping the cores of our cities and towns.<\/p>  <p>  In general, this Bill is adopting a carrot and stick approach.  This is the stick element of it, where we are proposing, given due process, to introduce a vacant site levy to stimulate the development of these sites and to bring them back into beneficial use.  Nobody could disagree with that rationale in the first instance.  How do we go about it?  Why are we now applying it to public bodies and local authorities as well as private bodies?  If we look honestly at the property registers of many cities and towns, public bodies own substantial tracts of land there.  With that ownership comes responsibilities.  If a person who is proud of their community looks at a site, it should not matter to him or her who owns the site once it is put into use for the benefit of the citizens of that community.  Local authorities have a responsibility, like everyone else, in this regard.  For those reasons, they are being included.  <\/p>  <p>  At the very least, the proposal that a vacant site, whether publicly or privately owned, will be designated as vacant will stimulate debate in the local authority chamber where the elected members are being given a new power to identify and designate such sites according to the needs of their areas.  Ultimately, the local authority will decide but it will be difficult for any local authority to target any particular site while neglecting sites in its ownership.  It will incentivise the development of those sites.  For that reason, we propose the amendment and I hope we will get support for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#B00500","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I have one question as the other questions I wanted to ask have already been answered.

What was envisaged by Government, in view of the report commissioned by the Department of Finance which showed that we need to build 30,000 houses per annum, was that NAMA would address that need.  NAMA is clapping itself on the back after announcing that 4,500 houses would be built in the greater Dublin area by 2016, with the possibility of an additional 20,000 houses around the country in the next five years or so.  This is a drop in the ocean when one considers the housing need.

Local authorities already apply rates to themselves.  That is a known fact under our current rating system and, therefore, any liabilities that would result from a designation are identified and shown on the local authority books.  It is my hope - this is the reason we are bringing in this legislation - that we would not get to that stage, because a strict set of criteria is set down and there is due process before any vacant site is designated.  Again, it affords the owner, whether public or private, the opportunity to set out clearly to the local authority what he or she intends to do to bring that site back to beneficial use.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to learn from the past, we have to move away from urban sprawl, greenfield sites and a shortage of infrastructure.  The same Deputies who are complaining here now were the first Deputies to come to me with complaints about unfinished estates, protocols for unfinished estates, lack of infrastructure and half-finished infrastructure.  I am saying clearly that the intent of this Bill is to exploit and sweat existing public infrastructure that has already been paid for by the taxpayer.  We want to focus minds on local authorities, which are the authorities that will designate ultimately.  We are giving them that power.  They are also the same local authorities that prioritise their housing proposals.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a good question regarding local authorities that come forward with proposals for social housing on a vacant site.  I will give him an example of that in Fingal.  The Deputy said no capital funding was being provided.  The capital funding being provided to Fingal, for example, for the provision of housing has increased from &euro;6 million to &euro;81 million this year.  Whether it is Fingal or any other local authority, if a local authority comes forward with proposals to regenerate a site and provide social housing where public infrastructure already exists, if it is being prioritised by the local authority, it is logical to me that we in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should prioritise it as well.  Also, the figures stack up because the infrastructure is already paid for.  We do not have to go to enormous lengths and expense to install new public sewers, water facilities, electricity and so on.  <\/p>  <p>  This is about urban regeneration and refocusing development back to the core of our towns and cities.  We may not like all that is in the Bill, but it is an attempt to focus the minds of local authorities and their members, who have a strong responsibility, on this issue.  I believe that all public bodies, even if they are owners of sites, have a responsibility also.  They need to make plans for those sites just as everybody else does.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment stands.  I hope I have explained the rationale behind it.  There are strict criteria, there is due process and there is an appeals system.  It is not something that can be struck down overnight.

If someone has bought land for development and deems that there is no need for housing there at the time, I would point to the two categories we have in Ireland - namely, land banking and shadow land banking - and this one falls into the shadow land banking category.  It is land that did not cost as much as land that we would regard as being part of a land bank, and that will sell for a lower price, but fellows are hoarding it until, they estimate, the time comes when there is a need for housing on that land.  The Government should be catching those land hoarders in the net as well, even though the land might not be suitable for development currently.  There might not be a need for housing there right now, but the developer or investor bought it for a good reason.  That is what shadow land banking is.

Many people have one-off units in areas of towns that are derelict.  I will cite a case for the Minister of State.  An older retired woman came to see me.  The woman, who is on a non-contributory pension, has an old premises that she used to live in but that she had to leave.  It was half commercial, half residential.  It is an old building and she has priced what it would take to do up that building, which is &euro;250,000.  There is an old stone facade on it.  The property is not worth that.  We have to be careful that we are addressing a problem here and that we are not going overboard.  This retired woman will not get a loan.

We have the Derelict Sites Act if an issue arises regarding the facade of a building or the visual amenity, but these are the realities for ordinary people.  They are not developers or land holders and they would sell it.  I have cited that case, and I know other properties in respect of which people have not told me their stories but I would be reasonably familiar with the situation.  We have to protect such people.  That is why the provision is included.  It is not designed to get somebody who is a land hoarder out of the trap.  We know land has been developed in the past that should not have been developed, which is an issue to do with development plans and how the development took place.

Without such criteria, there is no justification for designating which sites in residential and regeneration land should be targeted for the application of the levy.  These are important justifications underpinning the vacant site levy measure aimed at incentivising the development of high-potential vacant sites in central urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes.

The criteria in this Bill go much further in a strengthened process to ensure a vacant site is one of high potential.  A key criterion to be aware of is that a site can only be designated where there is a deficit of housing in a particular area.  Where there is surplus housing or adequate provision in an area, this Bill would not allow a site in the area to be designated.  Section 6 deals with the register of vacant sites and section 6(4)(<i>d<\/i>) refers to &quot;whether the number of habitable houses available for purchase or rent was less than 5% of the total number of houses in the area.&quot;.

Obviously, there is a very good reason to do that in most cases.  One does not want to be lashing levies on people who might have a house or what is defined as a \"home\" empty for a period for understandable and legitimate reasons.  However, there is an issue of which I am aware, albeit I have to do a bit more research.  In fact, the Minister of State may be in a position to enlighten us.  I understand that in London and other European cities if a house is empty for a very prolonged period without good reason, there are laws which provide that those sites can either be taken by local authorities or that levies will apply to them.  One might not be able to take them here, but levies might be possible.  I would like to hear the Minister of State on this.  While one would obviously have to be careful and there would have to be a great deal of consideration as to how it might be done, it is wrong if there are built houses just sitting there for long period, whether they are in public or private ownership, when there are people in need of places to live.  We need to consider whether a provision should be included in the Bill to address that issue.

There is a link between this amendment and some of the others that I have tabled.  My problem with it is that there is too much reliance on the private sector generally in the Government's approach to dealing with the housing crisis.  This Bill is the working out of that logic, in that it asserts that the only way we will get the social and affordable housing that we need is by constantly incentivising, getting down on our knees and begging private developers to provide it for us.  I do not agree with this approach.  It will not deliver the volume of social and affordable housing that we need.<\/p>  <p>  My concerns in this regard are increased by the fact that the Government is going to provide a further large get-out clause on the 10%, in that developers can lease property back to local authorities, which is a matter that subsequent amendments will address.  The combined effect of these two provisions is to let developers off the hook completely, leaving local authorities with nothing.  They will not get 20% or even 10%, but 10% leased back, which means that they will get nothing.  I do not agree with the logic behind these provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#J02100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Naturally, we are not going to get a large amount of social housing unless the State builds it.  If the State ring-fenced 10% of property as social and affordable housing and there was zero chance of a developer getting out of that obligation, I would agree with the 10% level.  Currently, one cannot get financing from a bank if one owns a site but has to cough up 20% of it.<\/p>  <p>  Part V was a failure because we let it be so.  Ghettoisation has continued unabated because we have allowed it to happen.  If the Government cut the level from 20% to 10%, I would agree so long as no site could escape the social and affordable housing requirement.  Last summer, Kennedy Wilson received planning permission for more than 160 units at Clancy Barracks.  It told the council that it did not believe that the development was suitable for social housing.  It paid &euro;850,000 instead of providing property.  At 10%, that would have been 16 units.  The Government is doing away with allowing people to buy out of the obligation, but it will still allow them to debate how to sort out Part V.  Developers will have the opportunity to move the obligation off site and deliver the units elsewhere.  Doing away with the cash payment is a good idea, but the Government should not allow the units to be moved off site.  Be the site in Ballsbridge or Darndale, Part V must be applied.  If the site was in Darndale, we would be discussing affordable housing.  If it was in Ballsbridge, it should be social housing.  I would live with the 10% level provided that it was written in stone and there was no opportunity for developers to get out of it.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know whether my next point relates to this section, but the Government is changing a rule.  There was a time when a builder had X weeks to revert to a planning section and sort out Part V.  As the Minister of State knows, though, sites were being commenced without Part V having been sorted.  That the Government is changing this situation is a plus, as builders will not be allowed to start until Part V has been sorted.  If the Government wrote the 10% figure in stone and made it part of the planning conditions, there would be no need for a debate after permission had been granted and the builder could not start until he or she had agreed to fulfil these conditions.  There would be no need for a further meeting.

We cannot meet the housing demand by direct build only, as put forward by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I can guarantee that should he be appointed Minister in the morning, and with the best of intentions which I know he has, he would not deliver the number of houses we need to meet the current demand with direct build on local authority lands.  We are already greenlighting and approving shovel ready projects that local authorities are proposing but there is a time lag in delivering on them.  We must take a multifaceted approach to delivering housing.  In the first instance, we have turned around many vacant houses, by providing extra funding to local authorities.  We were rightly criticised for allowing these houses to remain vacant.  In the past year, we have brought back into beneficial use more than 2,300 houses that were lying vacant and boarded up.  Families are now in those houses.  We have also provided additional funding this year for an additional 1,000 vacant houses in our existing stock to be brought into use.  This has been our priority.  We have also, as Deputies know, allocated funds for the first phase of direct build of local authority houses and there will be a second phase announced in the coming month or so.  We will also be announcing additional funds for the approved housing bodies.  These are for new capital build projects that are in the pipeline.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not believe in throwing the baby out with the bath water.  By saying there is an over-reliance on the private sector providing houses, we are doing a disservice to the people on the housing list because we need the private sector to provide houses to meet the demand.  That is not an ideological position but the reality of the position we find ourselves in.  We are using all resources and all abilities to deliver houses.  Part V is an important element of that delivery in the private sector.  <\/p>  <p>  I can understand the reasons Deputies oppose reducing the obligation from 20% to 10%.  As was stated, 20% of zero is zero.  There has been very little construction and we need to ask why that is the case.  There is a question mark on the economic viability of building again because, to be quite candid, it is cheaper to buy houses than to build them in some areas.  Deputy Wallace knows that as do I and Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Until the market normalises to some degree and until we address viability, we will not get the type of housing construction that we want.<\/p>  <p>  We must try to incentivise construction by assisting the economic viability of building.  We have agreed to reduce the 20% obligation to 10% but it is not all one way traffic for the developer.  We have removed, as some Deputies have said, the flexibility that existed in the past to pay cash in lieu of houses.  We want housing units and that has been clearly stated in this Bill.  We have gone a step further.  We are strengthening the process because we are front-loading the agreement and the negotiation on Part V.  As Deputy Wallace has said, there now can be no commencement notice unless that agreement is in place as part of the planning conditions.  We are strengthening the Part V process to ensure that we deliver more units for the people who need them.  This is a critical element of the social housing strategy.  It is a multifaceted approach and this is just one element of it.  We need to see housing units being developed and construction projects starting.  We believe the Government's approach is reasonable and will assist in that area. We will oppose the amendment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#K00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I agree with reducing the obligation from 20% to 10%, provided it is written in stone and it is impossible to get out of the obligation.

I put this amendment forward out of genuine concern and desire to have a serious debate on the issue.  I remain open to hearing the arguments but I wanted to put it down because this is a central component of the Bill and I will consider it as we go along.  Essentially, I want to reserve the right to re-enter it on Report Stage, depending on what I hear in the discussions that I might have with people who are concerned about this issue between now and then.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of how much can we directly deliver, which, as the Minister of State indicated, is my favourite approach, I accept that some has to come from the private sector as well but we are not exploring fully the potential for direct build.  I was at a briefing by TASC recently and it was pointed out that apparently - I cannot give the exact title, but I can get it - there is some provision for about &euro;1 billion which one can get off balance sheet in the European Union for infrastructural projects where one can show it is infrastructural expenditure.  Such expenditure will not be put on the balance sheet.  I also believe from discussions we had on this subject with the Fiscal Advisory Council a week or two ago that a serious debate is opening up about structural deficits, what should be included in them and the degree to which capital expenditure should be included in them.  There is much debate on what should be considered a structural deficit and there are different interpretations of it.  However, there is a debate opening up in the European Union that endorses the view that capital expenditure of this sort should not be included in the structural deficit.  We need to wade in big time behind that argument.  It follows what Deputy Wallace has just said.  This is a no-brainer.  It is guaranteed saving of money that is currently being wasted on rent allowance and so on.  <\/p>  <p>               One needs upfront capital but in the long term, there is a guaranteed saving and benefit to the State.  We need to strongly make that case and to proceed in that direction and be much more ambitious in doing so.<\/p> <p> I will now deal with the provisions under Part V for social and affordable housing.  There is a large site in my area, namely, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire golf club.  As Deputy Murphy said, prior to the boom, some developers were burned by the Part V provisions because they had done the deal and paid extortionate prices to meet their 20% obligation.  However, should this Bill be enacted, the developer who was bailed out by NAMA, and is probably still in NAMA, will be required to deliver 10% of the land for social and affordable housing in the second phase of this development.  I consider that completely unacceptable, particularly when the developer was bailed out by NAMA.  <\/p> <p> At this point, things are on the floor in terms of the number of houses being constructed but let us remember that we will head upwards, although never to the mad levels of building 80,000 to 90,000 houses a year.  When the market normalises, with the construction of between 30,000 to 50,000 houses per annum, and the hope is that the sector will head in that direction, I would hate to think that when more houses are being built, we will not get the necessary social and affordable housing to ensure we have a social mix.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#K01200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I am puzzled as to why we are rowing back from 20% to 10% of the land that must be provided for social and affordable housing.  There is a myth among the general public that local authorities were given up to 20% of the land zoned for residential use.  I know that it was quite common for it to range from 17% to 18% but the local authorities had to buy the houses.  In some cases, the developers and builders used low grade material in the social and affordable houses, with some of them leaving a lot to be desired.  However, other developers built houses that ranged from okay to very good.<\/p>  <p>  I am at a loss to understand the reason we are reducing it from 20% to 10%.  There is a growing need for affordable housing, particularly in the cities and larger towns.  The previous Government has been criticised, and it may have deserved criticism for some things, but the figures as set out show what was built under the social and affordable housing scheme each year.  Many people who otherwise would not be able to buy a home were able to buy a home under this scheme.  I think it is a retrograde step to halve it to 10%.<\/p>  <p>  The provision in this Bill is that the development has to be a minimum of ten houses - in other words, the local authority will be able to buy one in ten whereas in the past, the local authority had the option to buy one house in five and often had the same option when four houses were built.  I think the reduction to 10% is a retrograde step.  I am at a loss to know the reason for this.  Has the need for affordable evaporated?  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there are parts of the country where one can buy a house cheaper than any local authority could provide a house, especially in more rural areas, where there is no demand for housing and the ghosts estates are lying idle.  Even in County Laois, I can see parts of the county where it would be hard to give houses away but in other parts of the county, there is a high demand and prices are starting to outstrip what people who are earning reasonably good wages in steady jobs can borrow.  We must look again at the provision of affordable housing and bring it up to 20% in the first instance<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#L00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>First, I have to disagree with Deputy Stanley for giving Fianna F&aacute;il credit for the provision of affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#L00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>What I am saying is that under the previous Government, there was an obligation to provide 20% of land for social and affordable housing and that is better that the 10% proposed by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#L00400","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Government did not deliver 1% of it.<\/p>  <p>  If 10% of the land zoned for residential and-or residential and other uses is ring-fenced for social and affordable housing, there will be less pressure to deal with it.  There was a major flaw in the old system.  If a builder bought a site to build 50 units and paid &euro;100,000 a unit, under the current Part V provisions, he had to provide 20% of the site for social and affordable housing and accept a payment for the site at the agricultural value of the land and a payment of his costs plus 15% for the house.  Paying a builder &euro;1,000 for a site that he had paid &euro;100,000 for made the scheme unbankable for many developers.  It did not work.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how the Minister of State proposes to handle the site value.

Let me assure Deputies that we share their ambition to deliver as many houses as possible to address the housing need.  We might not agree on how we will do it but the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly and I are adamant that we focus our attention on trying to find ways to leverage more houses to meet the needs of society.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the genuine concerns of members but we have to come up with solutions on the best way that we can deliver houses as early as possible.  The Part V provision is one way of doing that and we feel our approach is balanced, strengthens and ring-fences the 10% and ensures there is no payment of cash in lieu of houses, as was previously possible.  We are making serious interventions to strengthen the Part V process to ensure that we get units and not cash or other alternatives.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett remarked about funding of &euro;1 billion being available off-balance sheet.  I am not aware of that, but I am aware that the approved housing bodies, for which we want to see an enhanced role, have the capability and the capacity to raise funds off-balance sheet.  We want to see them coming forward with proposals to the Department so that we can work with them and the local authorities to deliver more units.  That is another mechanism of delivering housing distinct from Part V.  <\/p>  <p>  We are also considering alternative proposals as part of our social housing strategy.  We want to find ways to leverage off-balance sheet funding to put it into capital projects.  Ultimately, the delivery of a house from the concept through the planning, tendering and construction stages is an equation.  <\/p>  <p>               It is an equation, which must take into account the viability of a construction project.  Unfortunately, the market has not normalised just yet because there are still properties for sale out there for prices far below what it would cost to build them.  They are working through the system.  Deputy Stanley raised the idea of local authorities purchasing them.  We are approving local authorities to purchase houses directly where there is value for money and where there is a strong housing demand.  They are being approved all over the country as we speak.  However, we need to be careful that we are not soaking up all the houses that are available to young couples who require houses.

They understand there is a permanency about those units being delivered, but they are not going to be long-leased.  Some elements of the housing programme are about long-leasing existing properties in the private rental sector.  The concern relates to some of the Part V requirement being satisfied by a long-leasing arrangement, as opposed to permanent ownership of the housing by the local authorities.  At the moment local authorities are out looking to purchase homes for people.  The problem is that we could end up doing exactly the same thing in 20 years time to replace houses that have been occupied by people under this scheme.  That is a serious concern.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the housing associations.  I know of some very good examples and some very poor examples of housing associations, but the bigger housing associations tend to be the better ones.  When we had Dr. Michelle Norris in here talking to us about that, she said there was money available from the European Investment Bank<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>for housing associations, but there was one proviso that she and others made, namely, that they are set up as charities and are precluded by law from undertaking a project that would ensure they ended up with a loss.  They require some level of co-responsibility in terms of leveraging that fund from the investment bank.  We cannot criticise or blame them if we do not give them the wherewithal to do that, and I have not seen any legislation to change that scenario since they were in here.  We were told there was no shortage of money to be leveraged from the European Investment Bank, within reason, for that purpose.  It is important that the Minister of State respond to that and say that is out there and they could do something.  They can only do something if they are given the ability to do it by a change in the Government's approach to co-responsibility.<\/p><p>Deputies Wallace and Boyd Barrett have put forward some of these amendments in my name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#M00700","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>This committee may recall that when we did a report on housing we recommended that we would exempt developments consisting of an integrated scheme of retiring houses and houses with care from Part V requirements.

We do not get permanent social housing, we get property that is being leased by the developer.  In effect, this is a way out of even the 10% requirement.  They get 90% at full-market profitability for themselves and then they can lease the other 10% at market rates.  Given market rates at the moment, that is a recipe for sucking local authorities dry.  The money continues to pour out from the public sector to the private sector, but we do not even get something permanent to call our own social housing.

It completely stands the original intention on its head.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that the previous Part V was not everything it could have been.  It was not wild and wonderful.  There were flaws in the system.  However, the leasing arrangement will cause many problems, including in estate management.  If the number of rented houses in a development is too high, in particular if they are leased privately, then the chemistry is different than if one is renting from a local authority in the sense that the local authority owns the house, which leads to a sense of permanency.  People see it as their house.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I spoke about the fact that I live in an estate that has Part V housing, both affordable and social housing, mixed in with private housing.  People on one side of me are council tenants and people on the other side own their house.  There is no difference.  It is all the one, in the sense that everyone looks after the house in the very same way.  The housing mix can work when it is done right and social and affordable houses are dispersed properly.  The problem with leasing is that one will get a glut of apartments or low-grade housing in one corner.  When prices begin to rise again unscrupulous developers will shove social housing into one corner.  Some day when the Minister of State is in Portlaoise I will show him some bad examples of where that has happened already.  It will be possible to develop a low standard of apartment or houses of the minimum size and to lease them to local authorities that do not have any other way of getting housing and they will put people into them.  That will create another ghetto situation.<\/p>  <p>  In the long term the approach will provide very poor value.  I accept that a balancing act is required and that all the housing that is required cannot be pulled out of the air tomorrow morning.  Leasing for a long period will ensue and tenants will pay the differential rent.  I understand there will be a gap in that regard.  When a house is owned by a local authority the rent goes directly into its coffers.  That adds up very well on the balance sheet in the local authorities with which I am familiar in terms of what comes in in rent and what is spent on maintenance and paying off the capital.  It is a good investment in the long term which works out reasonably well for local authorities.  At the end of ten, 20 or 30 years if a tenant decides to buy the property then the local authority will get another pot of money following the purchase.  Such an approach is better in the long term and it creates better, more stable communities.  There is an inherent problem with leasing.  I read in the newspapers about what the Tories are doing in England.  They are paying people in local authority houses in London to move out to private rented accommodation in the shires.  Their intention is to sell off local authority housing.  I accept that is not what the Government is doing but it is a slippery slope.  An income stream is not being created for local authorities.  A noose is being put around their necks.  Local authorities will pick up the bill for the situation in years to come, as well as the communities where stability is lacking.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is not going in the right direction.  The previous Part V arrangement dispersed social and affordable housing in the community and provided for permanency for local authority tenants and people buying their homes under the affordable housing schemes.  Such an approach consolidated the community and it worked very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#N00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I accept the grouping of amendments covers a range of areas.  I will try to address some of the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy inquired about how the European Investment Bank could assist and fund social housing.  Some approved housing bodies already have the structures and capacity in place.  They have proven they can raise funds via the European Investment Bank through the Housing Finance Agency.  We have examples of that where some projects in this country have been funded for the first time this year through the European Investment Bank.  It is our ambition to see many more follow that.  Deputy Murphy is correct in one regard, namely, that we need some level of regulation of the approved housing bodies in order that they can prove they have the structure and capacity to raise funds in this way.  In order to address the matter, the Government intends to introduce an approved housing body regulation Bill in the autumn.  That will provide an opportunity to bring the stakeholders together and to hear all their views and to advance the cause and need for housing bodies in order that they can access funding to deliver more houses.<\/p>  <p>  If I understood him correctly, Deputy Coonan inquired about exempting retirement housing schemes from Part V and other such schemes.  It is not the intention at the moment to exempt them.  That is not being considered at this stage.  I could give the Deputy some more information on the plan in that regard if he so wishes.<\/p>  <p>  On the concerns expressed about leasing and rental agreements, the intention is that leasing and rental agreements would give options to local authorities in negotiating Part V agreements.  They offer a number of advantages which I will try to spell out for the committee.  The overarching policy objectives set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 place a considerable emphasis on a tenure mix and the use of the private rental sector as a means of meeting the social housing needs of society.  I have already explained that there is no one solution to the demand that exists.  The private sector has a strong role to play in meeting the urgent demand we face at the moment.  Therefore, the strategy envisages a stronger partnership approach between local authorities, approved housing bodies and the private sector, which the concept of long-term leasing supports.  Furthermore, the strategy envisages a front-loading of capital investment in the early stages of implementation with a greater shift to current funding over the longer term.  The intention is essentially to front-load funding into the early delivery of housing.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities do require flexible options for the delivery of social housing and to be able to respond to the local need and local context.  This flexibility must be balanced with the need to ensure that as many permanent social housing units as possible are achieved with the financial resources that are available.  To reassure Deputies, in order to achieve such a balance, it is my intention to issue a ministerial policy directive under section 29 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 directing local authorities to the effect that where capital funding is available they should enter Part V agreements for the acquisition of social housing units, as the Deputy stated, rather than entering into a leasing arrangement.  Furthermore, where leases are being agreed they should be for a specified minimum period.  That will ensure the potential of Part V to deliver completed social housing units into the ownership and social housing stock of local authorities is maximised.  I hope Deputies will understand the intent of having flexibility for local authorities to negotiate in accordance with the resources available to them.  The Deputy can rest assured that the directive we will issue will prioritise the acquisition of such units over leasing, but we must have a realistic approach and that where we can get more units in addition to direct acquisition we will use the leasing and long-term rental process to achieve those extra units.  Essentially, we are not ruling out any mechanism that is available to us to secure more units.  That should be welcomed in general.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution on amendment No. 28 and Part V, in terms of profit, we will not accept the amendment for the following reasons.  It is accepted that there has been much difficulty with Part V agreements in the past.  Deputies have already spoken about the complexity of the legislation, which has been reflected in the number of court actions taken in the past.  We need to learn from that.  The proposed amendments to Part V are an opportunity to provide some clarity in the operation of the legislation and could ultimately save millions of euro while reducing time spent on negotiations, the engagement of professionals such as quantity surveyors and legal advisers in court proceedings.  We believe that by bringing certainty and streamlining the process, as proposed, we will eradicate much of the lost revenues and costs associated with difficult Part V negotiations in the past.<\/p>  <p>  Section 33(1)(c) substitutes section 96(3)(d) of the principal Act and provides that where houses are to be transferred as part of an agreement, the price of the houses shall be calculated on the basis of the cost of the land and the costs which would be incurred by a planning authority had it retained an independent builder to undertake the work on its behalf.  <\/p>  <p>               The price an independent builder would command in the marketplace would ordinarily include provision for profits.  Section 33(1)(<i>c<\/i>) should bring clarity on the costs to be considered as a basis for calculating the price of housing units to be transferred under Part V.  The amendment takes account of relevant court judgments and practical difficulties reported in the operation of Part V.  The inclusion of &quot;profit&quot; on these costs is consistent with the existing provision, and there is no change in the policy proposed.  Court judgments do not appear to point to any deficiencies in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#N00300","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I will make two points on the negotiations that must take place.  Many local authorities have lost some of the staff that would have been on temporary contracts and so on.  When developers are coming in and negotiating, there is a particular skillset that is not always available at local authority level.  The Minister might give us some assurances that there would be a beefing up of that expertise, particularly when it comes to negotiating rental agreements.  I am not at all happy that the Part V mechanism will not be indefinitely in the ownership of the local authority; I do not want to give the wrong impression in that regard.  However, should the Minister find a local authority in that position, where it is dealing with an experienced negotiator, and the construction industry is not short of an ability to lobby to ensure its own interests are properly served, it will be critically important in terms of the delivery mechanism that there is both expertise and an adequate number of staff to deal with that in an efficient way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#O00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>The Minister is saying that, in general, where the capital is available local authorities will be encouraged to acquire rather than lease, but that creates a major slippery slope.

I do not understand why it is not sufficient that they make profit on the 90%.  It does not cost them anything but there is an obligation to give us cost price on the 10%.  That is an entirely reasonable question to ask.<\/p>  <p>  I raise a somewhat related matter so that I can raise it on Report Stage.  Has the Minister thought about including a reference in the Bill to the local authorities having the money to buy existing property of individual units when it goes on the market?  A case arose recently in my area where a landlord is having to sell and evict their tenant.  However, the landlord does not want to evict the tenant and has asked the local authority to buy the house and allow the tenant to stay, and the local authority said it does not have the money.  In those instances, and there may be quite a few of them - we know this is happening - there should be some way that we can tell the local authority to buy the house.  This particular landlord is saying they will sell it to the local authority at a discount rate because they do not want to see this person on the street.  That is an acquisition area where we could get permanent social housing and save people being made homeless if local authorities are given the approval and the money to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#O00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Murphy, Boyd Barrett, Stanley and Coonan for their engagement on this amendment.  I acknowledge that, in the past, there were very difficult negotiations and complex court cases.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that, to be fair, local authorities have been denuded of many experienced staff in recent years.  In terms of addressing that, where local authorities are making proposals they can stand over, we are allocating resources to both housing and planning departments.  I can report to the Deputy that over 300 additional staff have been allocated throughout the country in recent months to the very departments she mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  To support the local authorities and the staff, we will be issuing strong revised Part V guidelines on negotiating agreements.  Also, this Bill, in its own right, will ensure that we have closer collaboration and co-ordination between housing departments and planning departments in local authorities because from a planning point of view this Bill demands that a housing assessment is done in an area before vacant sites, for example, are designated.  There has to be close co-ordination, and that is the way it should be because the Deputy and I, and anyone who has been in public life, knows that sometimes housing departments did not make good decisions in terms of where they built houses.  They did not look at sustainable planning, and we did not have that close co-operation that was needed.  This Bill in itself will ensure that we have closer collaboration.  I put the challenge to local authorities that their strategic policy committees, SPCs, which will have an enhanced role, the housing SPCs and the planning SPCs, should make a joint effort in terms of how they will respond to the housing and regeneration challenge we face.  There are opportunities for local authorities in this Bill because it brings a new focus, resource and direction in terms of the way we will respond to the challenge we all agree exists.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have much to add in terms of the profits scenario referred to by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I have outlined the position and it is on the record.  We need to protect the options available to local authorities to ensure they deliver as many units as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked if the Department is open to proposals for single units.  We are already doing that.  Where local authorities have identified single units and put them on their priority list, and if there is value for money in it and it meets their housing needs, they are being approved for that throughout the country.  As the year goes on, we will be able to give the Deputy more detail on that by way of parliamentary questions and so on.  We are open to that, but it must come from the local authority as a priority.  Essentially, it is the housing authority that is responsible.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I have an open mind on various mechanisms that can deliver houses, be they private or public, to meet the current need and this Bill is targeted at that in terms of the approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#O00400","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>The issue of leases was not addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#O00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>It was addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12015063000002#O00600","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1435685400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I refer to it being coupled with the earlier opt-out clause relating to development contributions being lowered, which can have an impact.

We are introducing legislative changes, including those in this Bill, to reform the planning sector for the better, so that we do not have urban sprawl and unsustainable development of greenfield sites.  We are developing new planning legislation for the autumn so that we have a proper alignment of planning policies, from local to regional to national.

We have already had a detailed review initiated by this Government, undertaken by the Housing Agency and informed by public consultation, which Deputies should welcome.  I will not rule out similar reviews being conducted in the future.  The points made by Deputies are well made.  If further reviews are required they will take place.  I wish to inform Deputies that my Department routinely collects, monitors and publishes data provided by local authorities in connection with Part V and will continue to review and evaluate its success and, if necessary, we can come back for further debate.

For example, issues concerning the cost of an electoral commission depend on the remit afforded to such a body.  I am not in a position to answer all these questions, as issues such as the independence of the commission and how it is to be established are matters for powers higher than my own to decide.  What I would like to discuss, however, are the functions that would be afforded to such a commission.  For me, this is the key question.<\/p> <p>  Other experts have made presentations to the committee in recent weeks and have addressed a number of areas the commission could tackle.  I will focus on one, the area of research and education.  By research, I do not mean anodyne academic papers that no one reads but, rather, a monitoring of the system, whether it is fit for purpose, international best practice and so on.<\/p> <p>  The current process is an Irish solution that creates an Irish problem.  I have observed elections in a number of countries, including transition democracies and the likes of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, and noted that one of the first steps taken on the road to democracy is to adopt an electoral commission.  Therefore, we in Ireland seem to be rather slow on the uptake.<\/p> <p>  The primary reason Ireland needs an electoral commission is to carry out research into the electoral process and to educate voters and the rest of the population about it.  A commission is required to monitor the operation of the electoral process, which does not happen at present.  Systems and processes evolve in other walks of life but in the area of elections they seem to stand still.  For example, in the area of personal banking, there has been a movement from being able to withdraw money from the local branch only to being able to withdraw from any branch, and then there was a movement to ATMs and recently to online banking.  Why is there no organisation monitoring the practice of elections in Ireland that could oversee a similar evolution?<\/p> <p>  We are using pretty much the same system for the past 100 years, with very little review of the process.  For example, we must register at a police station, we must vote at a local school, we must still use pen and paper, and we are still using limited constituency sizes of three, four and five seats when it is known that proportional representation can be achieved only with constituencies of five seats or more.  There is no reason we cannot have larger constituencies given the small size of Ireland.  The recent European Parliament elections are an example.  South Australia, with a territory eleven times larger than the island of Ireland, uses the same electoral system as we do and yet treats the state as a single constituency for elections to the federal Senate.  Other areas in which the electoral rules have not evolved include the use of an inequitable arbitrary means of distributing surplus votes and the alphabetical listing of candidates on the ballot paper.<\/p> <p>  Tasmania, for example, uses Robson rotation.  New Zealand uses the Meek method.  Australia and Scotland use the WIG method.  Are voters aware of all these methods?  Are the administrators aware of them?  Why is there no consideration of them or research into them?  Australia is a fine example to mention.  It uses the same electoral system as Ireland for federal, state, territorial and local government elections.  It produces regular reports on the operation of the system and how it could be improved.  Conferences are held regularly to discuss various aspects of the electoral process, from voter registration and lowering the minimum age to vote to the design of the ballot paper.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, there has been a lot of talk recently about reform of the electoral system but its being specified in the Constitution is being used as an excuse to prevent change.  However, there are a lot of aspects to the voting system that could be altered by simple legislation without the need for a referendum.<\/p><p>This has happened in Australia where the single transferable vote system was transformed into a <i>de facto<\/i>party list system, even though it is still STV in name.  This came about following representations by, among other groups, the federal electoral commission.  I am not advocating such changes, but this is an example of the role such a body could take in Ireland to investigate such matters.<br\/><br\/>There is a vast range of areas that the proposed commission could look into and which I would be happy to discuss further, but the final issue to mention is voter education.  Voters in Ireland are not told how to vote or how the electoral system operates.  Do voters know the value of a third, fourth or fifth preference, or the value of casting preferences full stop?  This is important because we know that the large volume of non-transferable votes, which was estimated by Se&aacute;n Donnelly to be about 12% at the last election, can have an impact on the final outcome.<br\/><br\/>There could be voter education programs for the large non-Irish population entitled to vote at local and - for EU citizens - European Parliament elections.  Similar programmes could take place for British citizens who can vote at D&aacute;il elections.  Likewise for the Travelling community - do we even know what proportion of the non-Irish and Travelling community vote at elections in Ireland?<br\/><br\/>Symptomatic of the failings of the current system is the severe lack of online public information about elections and election results in Ireland.  Brief summaries are available on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's website for the last set of D&aacute;il and local elections, but that is the limited extent of this coverage.  Compared to that available for other countries, it is woefully inadequate.  Ireland urgently needs an electoral commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Weeks","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and other members of the joint committee for giving an opportunity to the Department of Finance to contribute to the discussion on the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland.  I would also like to wish the committee well in its deliberations.<\/p> <p>  My comments will be brief.  The Department&rsquo;s role in the electoral system is quite narrow and specific but it is an important one.  I should explain that the costs for returning officers for the conduct of elections and referendums are paid directly from the Central Fund by the Department.  The Department is responsible for the Central Fund and for drawing up the finance accounts, which are the annual accounts of that fund. <\/p> <p>  The Department supports the view that returning officers&rsquo; costs should continue to be charged to the Central Fund.  The alternative of charging them to a Vote would not be appropriate or practical.<\/p> <p>  Because of the way the current system works, the Department has much of the accountability for election expenditure, even though its role in the system has been reduced since the establishment of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  The Department is suggesting that accountability for returning officer costs should transfer to the electoral commission.  The costs would continue to be charged in aggregate to the Central Fund.  However, the commission would make onwards disbursements to returning officers and would account for them.  We think this would be a more transparent system compared to the current approach. <\/p> <p>  Based on our experience, we also consider that an electoral commission framework around returning officers would enable a greater level of co-ordination among returning officers.  This would allow them to resolve common issues and deal with logistical matters on a collective basis.  It might even facilitate greater efficiencies in the conduct of elections and referendums. <\/p> <p>  To summarise, the Department of Finance position is that the electoral commission should have a role in the financial arrangements for the conduct of elections and referendums, and should have accountability in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jimmy McMeel"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and other members of the joint committee for the invitation to contribute to their deliberations.  I understand that one of the matters arising relates to the issue of data protection and the possible use of PPSN numbers for the purpose of compiling a central or rolling register of electors by the new electoral commission.  I would therefore like to make some broad comments on that.<br\/><br\/>In the documentation so far, it appears that there has been no very detailed examination of the data protection issues.  The comments concerning data protection have been quite broad and headline in nature, so there is an opportunity to expand on that in more detail, not only with the electoral commission itself when it is established, but also in the ongoing process.  I would also endorse the comments of the previous data protection commissioner on these issues.<br\/><br\/>One of the starting points for this type of discussion concerns alternatives.  While we are thinking of PPS numbers, we should also ask whether there is anything else we might think of as solutions to some of the concerns and problems that arise.  Some of these have been mentioned already, such as matching, consent and computer identifiers.  There may be other solutions to some of the problems as well, however, so we should not just leap forward and go straight to creating a new exemption for data protection usage.<br\/><br\/>If, after looking at those alternatives, there is an issue about considering PPS numbers, we should examine what the justification for that is.  However it is defined and elaborated upon, we should also ensure that it is clear, justified and limited so that what is intended for one purpose is not so openended that it can be used for other purposes or justifications, or effectively become an example of mission creep whereby other unintended consequences can arise down the road.<br\/><br\/>While some issues and concerns have been raised in the discussion, it is important to separate these different purposes and consider each one individually.  At the end of the day, purpose No. 1 might be justified but purposes Nos. 4, 5 and 6 may not be.  Therefore, each activity and purpose requires individualised consideration. <br\/><br\/>Principles to bear in mind from the perspective of data protection include data minimisation and proportionality.  While we can create an exemption we should not necessarily leap to the widest exemption possible.  There should be a proportionality to what it is we are creating in an exemption, if there is to be an exemption.<br\/><br\/>There are other separate matters to bear in mind, some of which have been briefly flagged.  There is a strong argument that the PPSN should not appear on the register itself and may not, or should not, be attached to the register.  There are also issues of verification and identification.  If we are creating an exemption for creating the register, that is quite separate and distinct from using the PPSN for identification purposes on polling day.  There is a strong argument against relying on PPSN for purely identification purposes on election day.  That is an example of where we should put some detail into separating the problems and possible data protection issues and purposes for individualised consideration.<br\/><br\/>Security is always an issue, particularly nowadays, concerning personal data protection, but it is a particular issue in terms of PPSN also.  A separate issue is that of marketing.  If there is a central register, it should not be available to people for marketing purposes.  The ability of individual citizens to opt out of marketing purposes should be contained in or continued over into a central register.  <br\/><br\/>Utilising PPSN <i>per se<\/i>is not necessarily a magic bullet for all the various issues and concerns that can arise concerning the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lambert"},{"type":"speech","time":1435670100,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comments.

It is certainly a view that I would share.<\/p><p>As regards Dr. Weeks's statement on proportional representation, is he suggesting that constituencies should comprise five seats or seven seats or should we just have a national or provincial list system?  Perhaps he could explain the rationale behind that.  We see substantial shifts that everyone in all parties are casualties or benefactors of, depending on which way it works out.<\/p><p><i>Ad hoc<\/i>changes are made by boundary commissions, whereby county boundaries are chewed up, maybe for good reasons.  In addition, there may be a completely new geography from one election to the next, with five-seater constituencies being turned into three-seaters.  It appears to me to be precarious.  Dr. Weeks might explain how he would bed that down.<\/p><p>It would be easier to have a more fixed boundary if an area were bigger as that would be easier to tweak.<\/p><p> In his comments on the Department of Finance, Mr. McMeel seems to be suggesting that the electoral commission would handle the funding and co-ordinate it.  Obviously, that would be of benefit.  He also said the electoral commission would have a co-ordinating role in respect of returning officers, which makes some sense.  What is the role of local authorities in terms of elections from the perspective of the Department of Finance?  Do they have a role at all?  I hope they have as they are local government.<\/p><p> On the vexed question of PPS numbers, it was stated that less intrusive alternatives to those should be explored such as consent or computer identifiers.  Can that be explained?  Can Mr. Lambert state whether methods used in other countries have been considered?  Are there any obvious ones that could be used as an identifier or any simple examples?  The address-based system we have here is not working as one can see on picking up any register.  Some people are not on it who should be while others are on it several times.  Some people are on it who should not be.  Its accuracy is very poor.  Mr. Lambert said that, obviously, one's PPS number should not appear on the register and I agree with that.  I can see good reason for not using it for verification on voting day.  As such, is Mr. Lambert suggesting that other simple forms of identity such as a driving licence or passport be used?  Certainly, one problem I have come across is that some people have neither.  There is a general acceptance that people have bank accounts, driving licences and passports, but we all know people who do not have any of those forms of identification.<\/p><p> What are the views of the witnesses on a rolling register that one can join at any time.  As has been said, the system is very restrictive with people having to go Garda stations.

Are there other ways of handling the verification process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#C00500","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":394,"content":"<p>On proportional representation, it is not my role to advocate a particular system but it is a role an electoral commission could investigate.  It was asked whether we should have more seats.  Personally, it is about whether one wants stricter proportional representation.  For example, in 2007 Fianna F&aacute;il won approximately 49% of seats with approximately 41% of first preferences.  If one wants strict PR, one will simply have to have larger constituencies.<\/p> <p>  Professor John Coakley has done research on moving populations.  He advocated the idea of having fixed boundaries in much larger constituencies.  As the population alters inside these fixed boundaries, the constituencies would lose or gain seats.  I imagine a problem returning officers would highlight would be that if one had larger constituencies, it would make voting a great deal more complicated, particularly when it comes to the surplus vote.  When it gets more complicated, machines might be needed to count votes, which is what happens in most other systems.  In fact, almost every other jurisdiction that uses our voting system, apart from Malta, counts with machines.  The number of votes in Malta is very small.  Every other system using the single transferable vote seems to use machines to count these votes.  My point is that there is no research in this area.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the returning officers do not have these facilities.  Research is being done by academics who are being paid by the State who are quite happy to provide the information, but we are simply not asked.  This is something that could be done and there could be some liaison if there were conferences between the commissions and academics and other people conducting research in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Weeks"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":395,"content":"<p>On Deputy Stanley's question on the role of local authorities, the Department of Finance is involved purely on the financial side of this.

It may be that some returning officers are using local authority premises for taking the poll or counting votes on occasion but, by and large, local authorities are not involved in the financial side of the operation.  It is the Central Fund and the Minister for Finance making payments to returning officers who then make onward payments, much of which is for the labour costs of presiding officers, poll clerks and those who count the votes.  There are also payments to schools.  Most of the returning officers are also officers of the court.  They are registrars for the local circuit court areas.  Some of them use court premises to store equipment and so forth.

Having been the beneficiary of the distribution of a surplus, what is the alternative?  Obviously, this not a science.  The returning officer literally picks up a bunch of ballot papers and distributes a surplus on that basis.

That goes back to that arbitrary picking up of bundles of votes.

In the likes of Longford-Roscommon, it affected Denis Naughten in 1997 when he only got 23% of transfers from his running mate because his running mate was from a different county.  The simple method is to pick the whole pile.  Why pick just the top pile?  For example, Scotland adopted the single transferable vote for local government elections a couple of years ago and it uses the weighted, inclusive Gregory method.  It is also used in Australia.  The issue for returning officers is in examining the whole pile of votes.  Let us say the surplus coming to a candidate is 100 votes, but the entire pile of papers is 1,000.  That means one will be dealing with fractions and each ballot is only worth one tenth of the vote.  When a candidate receives the surplus, if that is undertsandable, all of his or her ballot papers with his or her first preferences are worth one vote, but the ballot papers he or she receives from a running mate are only worth one tenth.  What happens if that puts the candidate over the surplus?  There will be fractions of fractions.  However, that is the method used in other systems because, if the votes are there, what reason is there for not counting them?  It is a far more equitable system.  When we adopted e-voting on a pilot basis, this was not the system recommended largely because it would have meant different rules for different constituencies.  I can understand that one would probably need machines to count fractions of fractions.  It was done once by hand in Australia and the votes got mixed up.

I recall about &pound;500 million being spent on advertising the e-voting process.   I do not just mean young voters, because young voters are not the only first-time voters.  I mentioned members of the Traveller community and the hundreds of thousands of non-Irish people in this country who are entitled to vote at local and European elections.  They use entirely different voting systems.  We have a very unusual voting system.  Only one other lower house of parliament in the world uses our voting system and that is Malta.  It is not a simple \"X marks the spot.\"  Most ballot papers in most countries involve a party list system, so it is just an \"X\".  That is not the way our system works.  In Australia, a person must cast a preference for every single candidate or his or her vote is not counted.  I know that counting officers in Ireland are quite liberal, so if a person starts his or her preferences with 68 or 72, I believe that vote is still counted as long as a clear preference is indicated - for example, if the person starts with 72 and then continues with 73 and so on.<\/p> <p>  I do not see the education process as taking place just in schools.  In my original submission to the committee a few weeks ago, I likened it to being handed the keys to a car and being told the instructions are on the dashboard and to go ahead.  Those are the only instructions being given by the Department.  A person gets a ballot paper and at the top there is an instruction to vote one, two, three and so on.  When I voted in the recent referendums on marriage equality and the age of presidential eligibility, old people in the school asked me what it was about because there was no mention on the ballot paper of the actual text of the change that was going to be inserted into the Constitution.  This was the first time people were thinking about this.  Simple public information is available in other countries, be it in post offices, on television and radio or in newspapers.  It is quite a simple system.  <\/p> <p>  Even when people are told to vote one, two three and so on, the average number of preferences cast in Ireland is three.  That is not the average number of candidates.  I know that at the last election there were at least a dozen candidates in most constituencies, but people just stop at the third or fourth preference.  They say, \"What's the point?  Is this third or fourth preference going to count?\".  I teach modules on elections in university and my own students tell me that their fourth preference is worth only a quarter of a vote so it is not as important as the first preference.  There is a severe lack of information.  Even having questions from Deputies about how the voting system works indicates that there is some failure in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Weeks"},{"type":"speech","time":1435670100,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Should there be more of a national campaign to educate people, be it in newspapers or on radio?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#F00900","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I know all this will cost money.

I agree with him completely because I do not think there has ever been an election after which people have not asked me whether they voted correctly.  The very fact that adults who have been voting all their lives are asking that question shows the need that is not being met.  Youngsters who have gone through secondary school would have been taught a very mechanical type of voter education that does not go into the detail that is needed, but it is an ongoing process.  It seems that we are outsourcing responsibility when it comes to more vulnerable groups.<\/p><p>For example, the Vincentian Partnership has worked with marginalised groups on voter education.  That should be the responsibility of the State rather than a private matter.  I agree the commission should have a formal remit in this area, which would perhaps include schools and ongoing research and education.<\/p><p> There is a fixation on counties in terms of identity.  Sometimes it escapes us that counties did not exist prior to the 12th century and the last one was created in the 17th century.  They are not uniquely Irish but we have come to identify with them, whether for electoral purposes or GAA matches.  Are these identity issues present to the same degree in other jurisdictions or are Irish voters unique in assuming they will lose out if they do not have a Deputy from their county?  The urban living project carried out by Maynooth University produced some useful work on identity which suggested that it happened at a much lower level.  It may be the case, therefore, that we are overstating identity as an issue.<\/p><p> In regard to data protection, we keep returning to the electoral register.  This is an important issue for the electoral commission and I expect it will be the first item on its agenda.  It is important that data protection is put at the centre of the register rather than on the periphery as an issue to be addressed.  We have run into all sorts of problems with data protection, not least of which was Irish Water's use of PPS numbers.  We recently introduced amending legislation to overcome a difficulty that had arisen with data protection and post codes.  The current register is a public document and I do not doubt it is being used for marketing purposes because data have become a commodity.  How can data protection issues be overcome for a public document?  I agree that PPS numbers should not be included in public documents.  How do other jurisdictions deal with data protection issues or prevent the use of registers as commodities for marketing purposes?

Put more broadly, the question is whether institutions influence behaviour or if behaviour influences the type of institution created.  We are often guilty of overestimating the effects of the voting system.  If we followed the example of Israel and the Netherlands by voting on the basis of the entire country as one list, the quota might be very low and voters in certain localities could choose candidates from their area.  Professor John Coakley has written about the national election of 1925, which was held by single transferable vote.  The quota was between 20,000 and 30,000 and candidates ran on a county basis because, for example, a candidate for Cavan might have enough votes from that county to get elected.  Regardless of whether that is a bad thing, it suggests changing the rules might not change the voters' behaviour.<\/p> <p>  The question also arises as to why one would want to change the mentality of voters and their way of thinking about their counties.  Voting behaviour and constituents' interactions with Deputies might change over time but these patterns run far deeper than the size of constituencies or the number of Deputies.  Ireland is one of only six EU member states which divide up their countries into constituencies for elections to the European Parliament.  Why do we do this, particularly given the mess we saw at the last election?  It is clear that, aside from the question of the importance of counties, the use of county boundaries restricts the process and creates problems.  We saw an example of this with Deputy Catherine Murphy's experience in Kildare in 2007 on foot of changes in voting numbers and population size.  This is related to Deputy Stanley's question about whether we should introduce fixed boundaries.  They would be easier to manage and as the population changes, we could simply alter the number of seats.  This is why we need a commission to investigate these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Liam Weeks"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":437,"content":"<p>The use of the electoral register for marketing purposes is a legitimate concern.

The reason we asked about cost is because we do not want to reinvent the good practices and expertise of local authorities.  It might be expensive for a new commission to rebuild these functions from the ground up.  What is the cost of the electoral register at present?

The postal service in New Zealand is used to maintain and update the electoral register but a new postcode system is being adopted here and the postal service is being computerised.  I would like to link that to matching identifiers.  Mr. Lambert referred to other methods that could be used other than using PPS numbers.  The use of these numbers, however, would be straightforward because everybody has one them and it would be a common link though all computer systems in every Department and local authority.  I acknowledge individualised consideration has to be given to each issue in the recommendations we make.  What could be used as a matching identifier other than a PPS number?  Is there a data protection issue relating to linking these numbers to postcodes, which means they could not be used?<\/p><p> Education is a major issue and teachers would be amazed listening to us, if it was not, because the CPSE programme has a module on voter education.  There are other good modules in this regard, which are delivered regularly as part of the continuing professional development for teachers.  They relate to how to vote, postal voting, the mechanics of voting, and the single transferable vote and how it works.  Schools are doing a little but they could and should do more.

I am fully supportive of the electoral commission.  It is a very good idea and it needs to be broadly based and given a very broad remit.  The issues which should not be included in it are policy issues regarding legislation and constitutional matters which should be left to the appropriate Department, and boundaries should not be within its remit either.  If the electoral commission deals with election activities on a day-to-day basis, the staff involved could influence boundary changes for their own administrative convenience.  It would be like giving local authority managers the power to set electoral boundaries.  They would consider the staff in each area and what suits them from an administrative point of view, and they might adjust the boundaries to suit the internal administration of the organisation.  This is why the boundaries should be independent of the commission.<\/p><p> A key issue which I have mentioned before is the voters' register.  We should have one national voters' register.  At present each local authority goes about the work on an individual basis.  There are set procedures but there is an element of local interpretation of how various matters are dealt with, such as supplementary registers, second supplementary registers and draft registers.  An essential element of the voters' register is that a PPS number would have to be produced for a name to be on the register, but I stress the PPS number would not appear on the register.  It would be used by the registration authority for administrative purposes and subject to data control legislation.  It would also facilitate ease of transfer if people move house.  It is a bit of an ordeal to move from a Dublin register to the Laois register or the Cork South-West register, and this would make it very easy.  This job should be given to an organisation such as An Post, as its employees call to every house regularly and know the people and the landscape.  Perhaps the new postcodes could help in this area.  Local authorities are not the organisations to do it.  In the normal course of their work, its employees do not normally call to people's houses and are not best placed.  It might upset some staff, who are used to the official nixer of checking the register every so often when the time comes, but they should not be involved in it.  It should be done independently by An Post.<\/p><p> The electoral commission should subsume the role of the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Referendum Commission.  Each time a referendum is called a new commission is set up with a new chairman.  If improvements are made or mistakes are learned during the course of one referendum a permanent body should learn from them for the next time.  The electrical commission should be responsible for the control of and reporting on all donations and election expenses, including at local authority level.  If we are to have one central body, we should not exclude local government from it.<\/p><p> The single biggest cost of every election so far is the cost of issuing the election address.  If five voters are in a house and six parties and candidates issue election addresses, it means 30 pieces of literature at 70 cent each are sent to that house.  It is by far the biggest cost of running an election campaign.  I suggest, such as what happens in a referendum, that when people hand in their nomination papers and are photographed for the ballot paper, a short biography along with that photograph should be included in one booklet to be issued to every voter, with the candidates' names in alphabetical order and a page for each person.  It would be like an information leaflet.  One document is enough for each voter.  The cost of it would finance everything involved in establishing an electoral commission because a substantial cost would be removed from it.<\/p><p> The commission needs to examine the question of people with disabilities who have difficulties with sight and those who are away with work or on holidays.  This leads us to the bigger issues of electronic voting and distance voting.  They should be re-examined by the commission from a practical administrative point of view.  I know electronic voting has a troubled history in Ireland and I hope it can be looked at again.<\/p><p> The electoral commission also needs to look at an education process for voters.  It is not generally appreciated that approximately 20,000 spoiled votes are cast in every general election.  Most constituencies have between 500 and 700 spoiled votes.  In ten, 15 or 20 constituencies the difference between the last two candidates for the last seat is less than the number of spoiled votes in the constituency, so there is a phenomenal number of spoiled votes and this needs to be addressed.  An electoral commission should look at it.<\/p><p> There needs to be a clear timeframe as the commission cannot do it all on day one.  It should be established with a mandate to deal with the register or to take over the role of SIPO first, over a three to five year period, and when the responsibilities are clearly identified as to what the functions will be, we can then speak about the reporting and accountability mechanisms to the Oireachtas.  I will not go into detail on it because my time is short.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#J00200","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the joint committee on the proposal to establish an electoral commission in Ireland.  One of the last major reports in which I was involved at the end of my parliamentary career arose from a review in 2010 by the Joint Committee on the Constitution of the provisions of Article 16 of the Constitution and the electoral system for the election of Members of D&aacute;il Eireann.  The committee considered that an independent electoral commission would be of central importance to the future operation of the electoral system and accordingly recommended its establishment \"as an urgent priority\" with responsibility for the administration and oversight of elections and referendums.  The 2010 report also recommended that the new electoral commission would assume responsibility for the registration of voters, postal voting, voter education programmes, the drawing of constituency boundaries - I notice Deputy Fleming has a different view on this - the system for counting surplus vote transfers and the examination of the design of the ballot paper.<\/p> <p>  At the time, the view expressed was that given the broad range of responsibilities the electoral commission would assume, it should include former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee also considered it appropriate that the commission be placed on a constitutional footing, as such a step would enhance the legitimacy of the process.  The discussion has since moved on, with the comprehensive consultation paper recently launched by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the excellent contributions to the joint committee in the discussions of recent weeks.  I have moved on, having retired from active politics at the previous general election, and in the meantime my views have been further informed by service on the Standards in Public Office Commission.  However, my views on the need to establish an independent electoral commission have not changed, and I am hopeful that what appears to be continuing all-party support for its establishment will help to get it over the line in the near future.<\/p> <p>  In considering its role, functions and composition, the commission has to be looked at in tandem with consideration of the proposal in the proposed public sector standards Bill which will, if enacted, introduce a new statutory framework governing disclosure of interests and relevant matters.  This proposal is to replace SIPO with a public sector standards commissioner who will have increased powers and who will, through the establishment of a deputy commissioner who will be independent in terms of complaints and investigation functions, implement more streamlined and improved complaints and investigation procedures.  The commissioner will have stronger powers of sanction and enforcement for a range of contraventions.<\/p> <p>  There will be some issues to be teased out as to the allocation of functions between the two new bodies, but in broad terms I envisage that all responsibilities under the electoral Acts should be dealt with by the electoral commission and all issues relating to standards and ethics should be dealt with by the public sector standards commissioner.<\/p><p>By that process, I achieve the same result as Deputy Fleming, namely, the abolition of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.<br\/><br\/>For those with quango creation concerns, which were raised at one point, there is the assurance that the two new bodies will absorb, subsume or bring to an end the current standards commission, the Referendum Commission and, if my suggested approach is adopted, the boundary commission, and probably also absorb other functions of existing bodies.  Ideally, both new structures would be established at the same time.  In any event, I would caution that care would have to be taken in respect of the transfer of ongoing functions of SIPO, particularly in terms of the current complaints being considered and, even more so, arrangements for completing ongoing investigations and inquiries.  I understand that certain transitional arrangements may be included in the legislation to cover this.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the key questions raised in the consultation paper and being considered at the moment, I am party to and support the views expressed in the recent SIPO submission to the committee and will confine these opening remarks to a few further observations.  In terms of the functions of the electoral commission, it should begin initially by monitoring and supervising the work done at local level by the local authorities and local returning officers.  It is important that such expertise should continue to be available to the new process.  I am unsure as to what may happen in the future, but there is a great deal of expertise that should not be ignored.  Ultimately, the commission should be responsible for a national voter database and be given statutory powers as to the use, with necessary safeguards, of PPS numbers or whatever technology may be developed that would have a function as regards individual voter identification.  The commission should assume responsibility immediately for referendum and boundary commission duties.  Excellent work has been done in the past by these, but the timeframes allowed for such work has often been too short.<br\/><br\/>On composition, the public has confidence in bodies chaired by judges or retired judges.  I saw a reference in the committee's debates to some judges having had previous political involvement.  I can honestly say that, whether as a lawyer or a politician or since serving in SIPO, I never had the slightest doubt about the integrity and impartiality of such appointees.  They bring a certain judicial presence which can be useful in running these commissions.  The existing <i>ex officio<\/i>members of the standards commission - the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Clerk of the Seanad - are ideal appointees.  In my experience, they bring expertise to the table.  There is an issue to be teased out about the possible double function of the Comptroller and Auditor General as a member while also being the auditor of the commission's accounts, but a solution can be found to that problem.<br\/><br\/>As far as former Oireachtas Members are concerned, I have the same view as I do about judges.  The two previous members of SIPO before my time were former Ministers from different parties to my own.  Both performed their functions with honour and dignity.  Appointees with a political background have an experience and expertise that is not available to others and can bring a useful public representative, as opposed to public servant, view to the table.  I also feel reinforced in my current position by the fact that my nomination to SIPO was approved by votes of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Perhaps as an additional measure it might be a requirement that any such appointment in the future be approved by a super majority in the Houses in order that such appointments would not be forced through.<br\/><br\/>Another point I want to emphasise is that reports to the Oireachtas rather than the Government of the day would reinforce the actuality and appearance of independence on the part of the new electoral commission.  I also envisage appearances before the appropriate Oireachtas committees for discussion of annual and other reports, and otherwise when required by the circumstances of the time.  I have already mentioned my view that, in time, the electoral commission should be given constitutional status.<br\/><br\/>I commend the work being done towards the establishment of a strong, independent electoral commission and the equally important work under way towards the establishment of an equally strong but separate ethics regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee.  I am grateful for and flattered by the invitation to address it.  I have followed the committee's previous hearings and do not propose to cover much of that ground except to say that I am struck that there was a general consensus in the expression of regret that this has taken so long and in support for the principle of an electoral commission.<\/p> <p>  As I have set out in my written submission, I agree with Deputy Fleming that the boundary commission's function should stay with an independent boundary commission.  In terms of the state of the electoral register, I am attracted to the New Zealand model, which has effectively franchised that under contract to its postal services.  There is an exciting similar potential in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In terms of bringing added value, I wish to focus on three points.  First, the integrity and confidence that the Irish electorate has in the election system are not to be taken for granted.  Like legal systems, integrity and confidence in electoral systems are the kinds of thing that one only notices when they are not there.  They are hard won.  We have had approximately 100 election-type days between referendums and local, European and general elections since the foundation of the State.  In all of my study, I have only come across two instances where anyone even uttered a controversy about the results in that period.  I will not name which, but that is a phenomenal achievement for a relatively young democracy born out of a civil war with troubles 60 miles or 100 miles up the road for a long period of its history.  Integrity and confidence are not to be taken for granted.  It is a compliment to the current electoral administration system that trust and integrity exist.  Therefore, any move or adjustment to the system must have regard to that.  This can be done as Mr. O'Keeffe suggested by retaining the skills, corporate memory and standing that county registrars and local government officials have in the electoral process, at least initially as we transition to an electoral commission.<\/p> <p>  Second, although there has been confidence in the administration of elections, there has been a gap between election days in encouraging and promoting participation in the electoral process.  I mean this in every sense of the word, from the maintenance of the electoral register and the design of systems that reach out better to young people for the purpose of registering to the need, especially in times of diverse and challenging media, for greater innovation in how all that is communicated and motivated.  It is in respect of this gap that an electoral commission has the most capacity to bring added value.<\/p> <p>  Let us compare the system with the administrators of Gaelic games, who have done that successfully.  We have not just watched them referee and administer the games well.  They have promoted the games, participation in them, their development and the modernisation of infrastructure in the same way.  This is because they are not just working on a Sunday or during a season.  They are focused year round on how they can improve interest and involvement in, activity around, the study of, the gathering of information on and the fine-tuning of their system.  A key task given by statute to the electoral commission should be the proactive promotion, modernisation and improvement of the electoral process generally.  This is in part because, in these changing times, which are politically volatile and volatile in communication terms, it is the best way to ensure integrity and support for the political and electoral systems.<\/p> <p>  Third, the committee will inevitably analyse whether an electoral commission should happen and what it should do at a point in time in 2015, 2016 or as it rolls out in 2017 or 2018.  How politics is done, the context in which it is done, the media environment in which it is done and the level of political competition in this country are changing exponentially.  An electoral commission is better placed - this is no criticism of the Civil Service structure generally - to adapt and be given the task of new initiatives that need to be undertaken across the system.  For example, the Government is committed at a minimum to overhauling the third level panels in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for the next election or whenever.  This in itself is a major registration task.<\/p><p>There would be some resistance around how we would go about doing that.  If we developed a free-standing electoral commission, that experience and expertise could be of added value.  The point I am making is that although the recommendations are made at a particular point in time, they must have regard to the fact that while we once had a fairly solid two-and-a-half-party system with traditional loyalties, this has loosened up, as have all of the communications and the demographics in terms of where people live and where they are registered.  I believe that an electoral commission with a more diverse skill set would be well positioned to chart those choppy waters.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435670100,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  This is the committee's third meeting on the issue of setting up of an electoral commission.  Reference was made to the level of abuses over the years in relation to registration, in respect of which the message appears to be that this could be addressed by way of PPS numbers.  Last week, I met a group from USI, which represents 300,000 students across the island of Ireland and registered 28,000 students prior to the recent marriage equality referendum.  One of the main issues about which it expressed concern was how slow <i>checktheregister.ie<\/i>is to update.<\/p><p>Reference was made to each local authority being responsible for its own register.  Is this the way forward in relation to getting people on the register?  In the past, we had rate collectors in every county.  However, that is no longer the case.  What is the best way forward in terms of getting people on the register?  We know from previous elections, including the most recent referendum, that there is often a clamouring to get on the supplementary register at the last moment.  I referred previously to abuses in the context of the last local election, when people who were not in the country were included on the register.  Despite the fact that many of those registered were living in Australia, Canada, America and so on, they were included on the supplementary register.

On his comment regarding updating of the register and <i>checktheregister.ie<\/i>, the difficulty with all of the local authorities doing this individually is that there is no real-time register.  A person could apply today to the local authority for registration but his or her name will only appear on the draft register next November.  There is no public body operating in such a way that applications, even for a medical card, are completed within three days.  When an application for registration is submitted, even to the supplementary register, this will not be confirmed until such time as the hard copy of the register is made available the week before polling day.  There is need for a centralised live system from which people could find out within, say, 24 hours, that their application has been successful.  That is important.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's point regarding the inclusion of people who were not in the country on the supplementary register for the last local election, I thought that process had been tightened up, because it has been the case for the past couple of years now that applications for inclusion on the supplementary register must be stamped by a garda.  Perhaps local authorities were being a bit lenient in accepting forms from people they know through their work in those local authorities.  That should be easily verified.  In cases in which calls were made to a house and there was no response, despite the fact that there were ten people at that address on the register, the matter was investigated by the local authority following the local election.  There may have been no prosecutions, but the matter was followed up.  There are lessons to be learned in that regard. <\/p><p>On the boundary charges, while I accept that people will have differing views on this matter, I believe this function should remain separate from the commission, because where people working on the administration of elections on an ongoing basis are involved in the drawing up of boundaries, personal or administrative convenience could come into the equation too much.  There are many difficulties in our current system, the biggest being the change in population, which people do not like.  There are more Polish people living in Ireland than there are Leitrim people living in Leitrim.  That is a brutal statement, but it is a fact.  There are nearly more Polish people living in Laois than there are people living in Leitrim.  I can understand a county feeling it has the right and entitlement, because of a geographic county boundary, to be part of a unique constituency.  However, if we are to count people rather than county boundaries, this will not always be possible.  I do not have the answer to the problem highlighted by the Deputy.  I know there are four constituencies in the county concerned.  To me, that is wrong.  People should have an association with whoever they are electing.  There was probably a better way of addressing the issues in that area.  While it might have been necessary to combine two areas, it was not necessary to combine four.  I share the Deputy's concern but I do not have an answer for him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#M00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":467,"content":"<p>On voter registration, I fought nine general elections, and one of the most frustrating things for any politician or aspiring politician is prospective voters who only find out on the day of an election that they are not on the register.  I have come across all sorts of situations, including people who have been on the register for years who only become aware during a particular election that there has been removed from the register, and cases of double registration.  In my case, my name was registered in Dublin without my knowledge, approval or consent, despite the fact that my voting centre is that of west Cork.  This issue needs to be addressed.  The views being expressed by practising politicians are very helpful to the debate, but at the end of the day, one of the first tasks for the electoral commission will have to be address of this issue, taking on board all of the views expressed.  I agree with Mr. Whelan that the expertise of the 31 local authorities, sheriffs and returning officers in this regard should not be cast aside.  This expertise should be availed of in the context of the establishment of a national database.  This can only be done by way of an individual voter identification system.  In this regard, use of PPS numbers appears to be the obvious answer.  I accept there are data protection issues, but this could be addressed by way of inclusion in the relevant legislation of a statutory provision and necessary safeguards.  Reference was made to advances in this regard as this process progresses, including the introduction of the new public services card, the new postcode system and so on.  Ultimately, we will have to ensure the best system is put in place.  It will be up to the electoral commission to address this issue, bearing in mind all of the frustrations and problems associated with this in the past.  It was mentioned that there are 6.5 million PPS numbers in use, which is slightly more than the population base.  We need to be careful.<\/p><p>On the boundary changes, I still adhere to my view that the electoral commission should handle that on an ongoing basis.  What happens at present is that an <i>ad hoc<\/i>boundary commission is set up with a judge and so forth.  It does its work on a one-off basis and is then dissolved.  I believe that a continuing role looking at the changes that might be desirable would be a better way of doing it, and the electoral commission would be responsible for that.  I take the point made by Deputy Fleming that some of the officials involved in the electoral commission might be keen to take the easy way out, but I have a higher opinion of such officials having worked with them on a similar type of business with the SIPO.  Ultimately, it will be the members of the commission who would make the final decisions and I believe the point raised by Deputy Fleming could be covered.  That is my view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435670100,"counter":469,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy McLoughlin, there are two issues with the electoral register.  One is the failure of the county councils to engage adequately with each other, particularly in Dublin.  It is 28 years since I went to UCD.  In the first year I stayed in digs in Ballinteer and I registered in Dublin South.  In second year I moved to Ranelagh and registered in the Dublin city area, but the council did not take me off the register in Dublin South.  In the third year I stayed in Blackrock, which is the D&uacute;n Laoghaire county council area, but I was not removed in Ranelagh or Ballinteer.  My father, being a councillor, made sure I stayed on the register in Wexford as well.  In theory, at least, I was recorded in each election as not having voted three times, which is why it affects the turnout as well.  That was in the mid-1980s, which was a great deal less volatile in terms of demographic shifts.  The PPS number is ultimately the answer, and we can get to that system.<\/p> <p>  However, there is another issue.  There used to be a pattern of active campaigns every October or thereabouts to put new people on the register or to put people on the register at new addresses.  In the recent referendum the campaigning groups, and the Union of Students in Ireland was campaigning in it while I was involved in another group, reached out to get the younger voters in particular on the register.  They did it in innovative ways, such as registration desks in the colleges and online encouragement for people to do it.  Some of that became controversial because a garda must certify the identity for the supplementary register.  It would not be controversial if the electoral commission was providing the same facilities, not requiring people to come to it to register but reaching out to find and encourage people to register.  If that was done properly on an annual basis, there would be less need for people to be on the supplementary register, so the additional cumbersome process of identification would not be there.<\/p> <p>  I tilt towards Deputy Fleming's view, as members will see in my paper, that the electoral boundaries should be done by a stand-alone, temporarily appointed boundary commission.  In fairness to boundary commissions, and like the committee members I am among the few people who have read their reports over the years, they have begun to develop a consistency at least in terms of trying to identify big geographical areas with which they can work.  The answer might be that the electoral commission would staff and support the boundary commission when it is established, in the same way that the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is currently on the boundary commission and it is staffed by a principal officer or senior officer in that Department, so at least the corporate memory and material is brought forward from election to election.  That might be part of the solution.<\/p> <p>  I emphasise again, however, that one of the most controversial powers in any electoral system is the power to draw boundaries.  It dominated for decades in Northern Ireland.  At one time here the folklore was that Kevin Boland, when he was Minister with responsibility for the environment, used to send over to Mount Street for the best tallymen before he would draw the constituency maps for the next election.  Then there was the controversy with the Tullymander, which ultimately gave rise to the change.  It was the first modernisation of our electoral system to allocate that to an independent commission and I would be careful about shifting it.  That is my general point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435670100,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I take the point made by Jim O'Keeffe about a permanent commission, but we carry out a census of population every five years and we should only change boundaries based on hard facts based on a census.

There were some interesting points and I will not repeat them.  However, I was struck when Noel Whelan spoke about his father putting people on the register.  One of the things that maddens people even more is when people like his father take people who have been on the register for a considerable time off the register.  That issue must be addressed as well.  There is nothing as annoying for someone who has been on the register for 50 years.  Suddenly, even though they have not died or gone away, as someone else in politics would say, they are not on the register on the day of the election.<\/p> <p>  At the outset it appeared that the witnesses were saying that the boundary commission should be separate from the electoral commission, but I notice Jim O'Keeffe appears to be saying that they should be a single body with, perhaps, sub-committees of it to deal with various things.  Noel Whelan spoke about confidence in the electoral system, which is of the utmost importance and a very valid point.  However, in the three elections in which I stood, there were up to 40,000 people who did not have confidence in it.  First, there was an area of south Tipperary brought into north Tipperary.  Second, an area of south Offaly was brought into north Tipperary.<\/p><p>If they think the boundary commission is doing its job right, the witnesses should talk to the people from Lower Ormond and Nenagh in north Tipperary, who have now gone into the Offaly constituency.  There should be more to a constituency than just the number of people.  We should also look at the location and the distance from one point to another.  For example, to go from one end of the new Tipperary constituency to the other is over 75 miles.  It might be better if we were joined up with Tallaght or somewhere.  At least we would have the motorway to get up directly to it.  There are major issues to be dealt with.  The other issue is that people are sick and tired of the various bodies, a commission for that, a body for this and something else for the other.  If we are to make progress on this, we need to solidify all of it and get it in under the one umbrella.<\/p><p> Deputy Fleming made a very good point about 20,000 spoiled votes, but nobody from his group has mentioned the people who do not vote at all and whether an element of the commission's function should be to deal with compulsory voting, or whether that is a political issue.  In any election, in his constituency or mine, the people who do not vote would certainly elect at least one Member if they were all to turn out.  We need to address that problem.<\/p><p> On establishing the register, the witnesses were talking about how they deal with the register and PPS numbers.  There are so many people compiling registers now that perhaps they should consider the experience of the Revenue Commissioners and Irish Water.  I am sure it would bring joy to many people if Irish Water had a role in compiling the register of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#N00800","speaker":"1087","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435670100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Deputy Coonan spoke about the upset caused by boundary changes.  People need a sense of identity with whoever they are electing to the D&aacute;il and the idea of somebody being a significant distance from the area, or not in the natural hinterland, county or even province is an issue the CSO figures probably just do not capture, as it is just numbers rather than people.  There is a fair point in that and the terms of reference of a boundary commission can be more specific than they have been.  They have tended to be specifically about three, four and five seats, protecting county boundaries in so far as possible and not breaching provincial boundaries.  To deal with that, we could have more specific terms of reference for the boundary commission, without being party political but taking those points into account.  We have done analysis in my own constituency and found that in those rural areas that would normally vote well, where there is a large area and some parts of the area are far from a polling station, the townlands that are farthest from the polling stations have historically had the lowest turnout.  It might be a 16-mile round trip to get to the polling station and people just do not bother.  That is a factor that needs to come into it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Coonan is right that the big issue we have omitted today is people who do not vote.  I am not quite sure whose remit that is in, but that is an issue.  We can talk about voter registration, but, to use the Irish Water analogy, they might be registered, but will they pay?  They might register for an election, but will they vote?  That is the big issue that needs to be dealt with.

I would not be rushing to introduce compulsory voting, at least initially.  We have to have a proper system where anybody who wants to be registered can be registered easily and will only be registered once where they are.  Clearly we do not have that because of the dispersed nature of what is there at the moment and other reasons.  After that, we want to ensure that those who want to vote can vote.<\/p> <p>  I also agree with Deputy Coonan that, while we talked about frustrations of people involved in politics and that of people who wanted to vote, the worst frustration I ever saw was people turning up at a polling station, having been on the register all their life, and finding that without their knowledge, consent, approval or notification they were off the register.  I can certainly understand that total electoral frustration.<\/p> <p>  On the boundary commission, I also take the point raised about identity, distance and so on.  The central issue, for me anyhow, would not be distance.  As the Chairman will know, Cork South-West is about 100 miles long, but there is a sense of identity in west Cork, which is sometimes known as the 33rd county.  The distance does not matter too much.  It is a bit awkward if one wants to be servicing it, but that is another day's work.  The biggest frustration I have found in that regard, going back a good bit, was when a chunk of the western area in B&eacute;ara was transferred into Kerry South.  That caused much more frustration at the time.  It is possible, but if we are going for a proportional representation system, we cannot go down to one-seat constituencies.  There is no total solution but in so far as is possible identity, whether it is like the west Cork identity or a county identity, should be given very high consideration in the establishment of constituency boundaries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1435670100,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The two elections Mr. O'Keeffe referred to were 1973 and 1977, where they took the B&eacute;ara peninsula, Castletownbere, and put it into Kerry.

The electoral commission's first function would be to bang heads together of the 31 local authorities and get them to compare notes and databases and then take those databases and compare them to the databases of the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  Sometimes it is just a database management and integration process.  A national body would have the power to insist that be done.  Simultaneously, as a national body it would run a national campaign in the autumn to encourage those voting for the first time or those who have moved area to register to vote at that stage so that they would not be caught up in the supplementary register process.  Those two steps alone could deliver a marked improvement and give confidence to the electoral commission to take on the broader task, if that is appropriate, and to the public and politicians that somebody is now responsible.  This comes back to the point made by the former Member, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe.  One of the difficulties that I see as an amateur expert in this area is the lack of expertise about the system.  The best expertise about the system is among the politicians in this House but by their very nature they are biased.  That is fair enough.  One cannot have the players being the referee as well.  There is no group whose job and life work, day by day is to compare how things are done in Australia and New Zealand and other comparable places looking at what is best and tweaking the system accordingly.  This is where I emphasise that technology can be a great help to the electoral process.  It also brings me back to Deputy Coonan's question about compulsory voting.<\/p> <p>  I would not go as far as recommending compulsory voting but there is a great deal more that could be done to encourage voting.  One of the campaigning groups for the marriage referendums in which I was involved ran a campaign called \"Get me to the Vote on time\" .  All the research from the referendums, in particular, shows that about one third to 40% of people did not vote on the day because it was not practically convenient for them.  Sometimes that is an excuse, sometimes it is real.  They do not think through where the polling station is located, the hours the polling station opens and closes and whether they would vote before going to work or, because it is Friday, after they go for a pint, which cannot be done.  One of the campaigns was directed at getting people to register on the previous Friday so that they would think about Friday, 22 May and where they would be, and what would be involved in getting to the polling station.  Again my point is that an independent electoral commission that was proactively engaged in communicating with the public would see that as part of its function so as to encourage voting rather than necessarily making it compulsory.  Text message reminders were used, not because the text message reminded the individual to go to vote but by registering for the text message at the time one indicated one would vote, forces the person to think about the following Friday and the possible calls on one's time.  It is all about using best practice and modern technologies by a group that has the remit and the expertise to make elections work better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015063000002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435670100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>That is a good point.

What I have to say is of particular relevance to the matter of the national postcodes, particularly the chosen system, Eircode.  I have spent many years in the positioning and navigation industries.  I worked for 35 years as a navigator and land surveyor, have relevant experience and qualifications in the field and am a fellow of the Royal Institute of Navigation.  The whole idea of a postcode and how it may be used is, in effect, a navigation technology exercise.  The conduct of a service, product or person from A to B is about navigation.<\/p> <p>  Way back in 1997 and 1998, I developed a specific interest and completed a master's degree in co-ordinates systems and geo-coding systems.  I went on to consider how those could be applied to mapping and navigation systems in Ireland and abroad and, in 2005, began developing what I believed was an address code system for Ireland, Loc8Code.  I did not necessarily view it as a national postcode as that had never been delivered.  Since Loc8Code was delivered to the market in 2010, I have amassed a lot of experience in a coding system for addresses in Ireland.  This experience is also relevant to the committee's deliberations today.<\/p> <p>  I have prepared a very detailed analysis of Eircode, which members have in soft copy and which is also available to them in hard copy format.  It is a very technical document.  The subject merits this level of technicality; we are not just introducing a series of characters to define or identify properties, but are introducing a piece of national infrastructure, which needs careful attention.<\/p> <p>  Much has been made of the fact that An Post may use Eircode.  It is my opinion that An Post will not use it much, although it may tolerate it, because Eircode does not fit with An Post's operations.  If that is the case, we must focus on the other users, namely, the transport and logistics industries, emergency services and, particularly, the ordinary people, who have not been mentioned much.  If the people in the street do not use this coding system, it is not a postcode and will be relegated to history along with other technical projects with which Ireland has been involved over the years.<\/p> <p>  As it stands, Eircode gives the user no intelligence about the location of the property to be travelled to.  In fact, it has less capability than latitude and longitude, which have been around for hundreds of years and with which most people are now getting familiar.  <\/p> <p>  People migh<\/p> <p>t suggest that I am coming to this issue with a vested interest.<\/p><p>It is important that I draw the committee's attention to a report by the Global Address Data Association, GADA, in the US, which was circulated to members during the week.  I will not go into its detail but, effectively, it says that Eircode is not a postcode.  The detail of the discussion is an indictment of Eircode in terms of what it is supposed to do and can do, and the fact that it is not the technical new generation solution for a postcode that people have claimed it to be.<\/p><p> We must not forget that when we talk about the history of a national postcode, it dates back many years.  Essentially, the national postcode was about levelling the playing field in Ireland with postal liberalisation.  The postal market should not be referred to or thought of as just mail, because the front line in the postal market nowadays is parcels and other companies, including couriers, deliver parcels.  If it is the case that the postal market is liberalised, everybody should be able to equally and easily find addresses in Ireland.  Eircode was supposed to be about that.  If it is the case that people from various industries have stated, before this committee or in other interviews, that it does not do that, perhaps the field is not levelled.  In my opinion, if we have spent 13 years talking about this, there must be significant reasons that it did not happen.  It is quoted that, perhaps, An Post did not want it to happen.  That is on the public record.  A postcode has not been designed for 13 years; it has been designed only since January 2014 when the winning bidder, Capita, engaged directly with An Post to design the code.  The document which covers that is in the public domain.  It is the postcode design document which runs from January 2014 to May 2014, when it was published.  That consists of a consultation only with An Post.  There is no record in that document of consultation with other people.<\/p><p> That is the basis.  I will deal first with the issue of whether Eircode has legitimacy.  I will not go into all of the detail.  I have raised some topics in the analysis as to why Eircode might not have legitimacy, but one of the most significant is that Eircode does not conform with, or deliver, the definition of a postcode that is in the legislation, the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011.  I realise the Oireachtas is dealing with an amendment to that legislation at present, but we already have an Act which defines what a postcode in Ireland should be and Eircode does not fulfil that.  The definition requires the postcode to define a locality.  In other words, if I look at the code and I wish to go somewhere, that code automatically delivers to me the idea of where I am going.  When we are going somewhere, none of us visualises the exact destination.  We always visualise how we are going to get there and the areas we will pass through to get there.  That is navigation and it is how people operate.  That is the reason the definition says that the postcode should define a locality.  The design document for Eircode states very specifically that it will not define a locality.  An Post has requested that it would not define a locality because there would be unreasonable expectations about where people live and so forth.<\/p><p> I have documented in the analysis other reasons that Eircode may not have the legitimacy it should have, but in that regard alone it does not.  In fact, if one reads the definition, it becomes very clear that the method An Post uses for sorting at present, which is the post town model and which the High Court gave sanction for An Post to operate and use in 2012, better conforms with the legislation and the requirement.  In fact, if we go ahead with Eircode there might well be the possibility of two postcodes operating in Ireland, one which has legitimacy and High Court sanction and another that has no legitimacy.  If Eircode is to be used as a property identifier for property related taxes and so forth, it could easily be challenged.<\/p><p> Effectively, Eircode does not comply with the legislation, nor does it comply with all of the recommendations of the last national postcode board since 2006.<\/p><p>It does not conform with the tender documents.  It does not deliver something required by the ordinary Joe Soap user.  Citizens of Ireland and visitors to Ireland need to be able to look at a postcode and use it in a useful way.  Eircode has ignored all the prior knowledge about postcodes that existed in the world.  If I was going to design something, as I have done, the first thing I would do is look at what is there, take what is good from it and enhance it as necessary.  Any designer or anyone in business globally would do likewise.<\/p><p> In the document I have furnished to the joint committee, I refer specifically to the Northern Ireland postcode, which is part of the UK postcode.  If one looks at the two examples I have included in my submission - BT4 1PW and BT4 1PY - one might not know exactly where those locations are, but one will see immediately that they are close together.  One cannot make the same judgment when one looks at an Eircode because there is no indication of whether two postcode locations are close together.  This is a critical issue for ordinary users.  It is important that there is some intelligence in the code that tells us we were there before, or we will not have to go far from where we were previously.  Above all else, one should be able to use the free Excel spreadsheet software that is readily available to order postcodes in a rational sequence for delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Delaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435665600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Delaney to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#F00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435665600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of brief points before taking some questions.  As I have said, Eircode does not deliver intuitive capability for ordinary people in Ireland.  It has been suggested that Eircode is a core requirement for mail.  I would argue that a national postcode should be about the widest breadth of national requirement.  There was a suggestion that the Eircode app would do for non-core matters.  It is well recognised that anything that depends totally on technology must have a fail-safe backup that can be used in a manual way, especially if it is being delivered by a state which has a responsibility to its people.  Eircode cannot be used in any manual way.<\/p> <p>  I will make one more point before I conclude, if the Chairman does not mind.  Much has been made of the fact that Ireland has non-unique addresses.  This is a concern mainly for people who operate address database lists.  The real problem in Ireland is ambiguous addresses.  It is a different problem and a much bigger one.  Everyone here has experienced the simple issue of standing in a busy street and not knowing which door is the right one.  There might not be numbers on the doors, or an upstairs apartment over a shop might not be identified.  The emergency services might be trying to reach someone who has collapsed and activated an alarm button.  Eircode does not resolve the big problem of ambiguous addresses.  It tries to rely on technology, including GPS, to resolve it.  As a GPS expert, I can tell the committee that in my world, we would not rely entirely on GPS because it has many limitations.  For example, it cannot and will not resolve the problems encountered in a busy city or town street or urban area, where there are upstairs and downstairs apartments and back and side entrances<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1435665600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Delaney.

As I said, there is a long history, which I have dealt with in the document, and I hope people have time to consider it in detail.  In 2006 the national postcode project board, which was appointed to come up with recommendations for a postcode system, defined nine criteria.  It is arguable that Eircode does not satisfy any of them.  I refer to two in particular.  One is that national postcodes should be based on small spatial areas.  Loc8Code does this, but Eircode does not.  I referred to localities and the definition of a postcode in the Act.  In the design document, Eircode does not do that.<\/p> <p>  From my navigation background, I am conscious that a person travelling anywhere first visualises the localities through which he or she must drive to get there.  Those recommendations were picked up by the board and brought forward.  We knew we could address that.  We also knew we could address the idea that the code must be future-proofed and based on technology, while also being easy to use and not hidden.  The UK postcode system has survived for 50 years.  It has problems, and I am not recommending it, but I am taking ideas that work from it.  It has many features that work, such as the fact that anybody can look at it and intuitively guess that something is closer or further away.  <\/p> <p>  These are all things we build into Loc8Code, not just because they were recommended by the national postcode project board but because we, as navigation experts, recognised that humans needed to know them.  They also need to know such things when GPS or the mobile phone network is not working.  We have SOS phones on the side of motorways because it is recognised that phones do not always work when there is a disaster and the emergency services need to locate people.  <\/p> <p>  When the tender for the postcode started, it used the 2006 national postcode project board recommendations as the reference.  The recommendation to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resource from PA Consulting in the months before that were that it was to comply exactly with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1435665600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>That was in the tender documents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#G00600","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435665600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Yes.  Loc8Code designed a code that was intended to fulfil all those requirements and did so.  The difference between Loc8Code and Eircode is that Loc8Code is intuitive.<\/p><p>There are localities in it.  It certainly depends on GPS - that is my business and my background - but it does not require GPS to actually interpret it.  It can be iterated in the same way as the Northern Ireland postcode that I have given.  Eircode cannot.<\/p><p> The other issue about Eircode is that it is totally dependent on a database which must be kept up to date.  I have supported sat-navs in this market for nearly 15 years, so I know GPS and I know sat-navs very well.  I know also that people do not keep them up to date.  I dare say, if there are sat-nav owners in the committee, I could count, probably on one finger, the number of people who have ever taken the time to update them.  If one builds a postcode that is totally dependent on a database and in that database there are coding systems that can change and need to be updated on a regular basis, then if the sat-nav is not up to date or the GPS is not up to date, one cannot use it.  If over-the-air communications, Internet, or mobile phone networks are required to access that database, we know that a piece of national infrastructure has the potential to fall over in the event of a major emergency or disaster.  The major emergency could be just a major pile-up or a crash on a motorway where emergency services need to get to the right location and the right access points.<\/p><p> In terms of a deliverable, Loc8Code has much more to offer.

John Tuohy of Nightline said that should happen.  No pilot is planned, so that is very worrying.  He also said in a separate interview that if it does not work out he can tweak it.

Mr. Delaney mentioned GPS, which cannot be reliable at all times.  I was in the south west of Ireland last month looking for a particular location, but GPS was sending me in the wrong direction.  I met a young man who works for An Post in Clifden and we were talking about the new Eircode system coming in.  He said they will be depending on the postmen to clearly identify homes.  I asked him what he meant and he gave the example that in a small area in Clifden on the same street, we have John and Mary Quinns at four separate addresses.  I asked him how he knew which piece of mail was for a particular address and he said \"Sure, after a while you kind of get to know their business and know which mail is for which address.\"  I asked him how he knew which of four ESB bills was for each address.  He said he did not but at least they go through.<\/p> <p>  Senator Barrett appears to be most concerned about the cost-benefit analysis and the &euro;27 million or so that is going in.  That is one particular issue.  This particular issue is about trying to identify whether this is the best code.  Mr. Delaney says it is not the best code.  Capita says it is.  The matter is with the Department.  It has been passed and is going through the various stages of procurement.  Addresses are not going to change.  I will still live, to use my parents' address, at 110 Cooley Road, Drimnagh, Dublin 12.  The Dublin 12 reference will not change and it might be D12XYZ.  The next door neighbour might be 112 Cooley Road, D12XYB.  Capita is telling us that this unique identifier in the last four digits is unique to each house.  As far as I am concerned, this is fantastic as it will eliminate the Mary and John Quinn times four issue in one area.  They will know that a particular Mary and John Quinn's unique identifier identifies their house.  The emergency services are saying this will be good for them.  An Post has said it will use it and there will be a cultural change in people's thinking about not using the address if they do not want to.  In the United States of America, where I used to live, the Zip code in Rye, New York, was 10580.  Philadelphia, 19085 is a locality that might have been three miles by three miles, but that code still does not identify an actual address on a particular street.  Capita tells us that this unique code will.  It is saying this is the first code in the world that will give us a unique identification.  The reason the codes are not going to be sequential is that it might be 400 to 500 yards from one house to another today but someone might build a house between them once the system is in place.  Therefore, they will have a unique four digit code at the end of it.  If Capita is telling us this will work, why does Mr. Delaney say it will not and that it is not future proof?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#L00300","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435665600,"counter":543,"content":"<p>There is a great deal in what the Senator has said there, some of which I think I have answered already.

If it is the best, it would have been established.  Everywhere else in the world where a postcode is being introduced, the idea is tested and piloted.  This has not happened here.  The fact that it is the first of its type in the world would suggest that we should test it before we go to the bother of rolling it out and wasting not only &euro;27 million, but all the costs to all of the businesses, including An Post, and everyone else who wants to use it.

If somebody tells me something is the best, the first thing I will do is test it.<\/p><p> Emergency services were mentioned.  In one of the annexes to the documentation I provided to the committee is a document from the director of the National Ambulance Service.  When people were sitting here stating they were behind it and supporting it, he wrote a letter to a private citizen, not me but an individual, stating he had never said it would do all that is required for rapid access to patients.  This is the direct opposite of what he was quoted as saying.  He also went on to say that he does not know enough about it to be able to talk about it in depth.  One would imagine if the director of a national agency supported something he would first investigate, test and analyse it and check its suitability for his or her purposes and for the public, because it is all about public safety.  If the director of the National Ambulance Service is saying he cannot speak about it in depth, perhaps he never had the chance.  I can tell the committee from other sources that neither the National Ambulance Service nor the fire service has ever tested or looked at Eircode in reality, as in a real-life scenario tested all the way through, which is what anybody would do if money was being spent on technology.<\/p><p> I accept if a business process outsourcing company such as Capita states it has the best in the world, we should believe it.  One would suspect the people who say this would have some technical knowledge but this is not the case.  There is no expertise on this in the organisation.  One would also ask the company to show where it has been tested.  An oversight contract was awarded to PA Consulting in April last year, and one of the requirements was that it would make a decision and assess whether Eircode was fit for purpose.  We have not heard this.  To do this, it would have to test and analyse it, but this never happened.  What is of concern is that we might roll it out and find it is not useful.  This should happen before we roll it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Delaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435665600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Mr. Delaney mentioned the document in annex C from the emergency services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435665600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>From the National Ambulance Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015063000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Delaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1435665600,"counter":547,"content":"<p>It states: \"I would like to acknowledge receipt of your numerous emails in relation to the Eircode initiative...
