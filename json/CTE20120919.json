I acknowledge the presence of the new Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on education, Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  I look forward to working with him and Deputy Jonathan O'Brien of Sinn F&eacute;in.  If they would like to receive a briefing or any information from the Department of Education and Skills in their own right, they are perfectly entitled to receive it.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman for inviting me to discuss with the committee the position of the Department in advance of budget 2013.  When I presented the Department's Estimates for 2012 to the select committee in April this year, I said engagement with the committee was an important element of the \"commitment in the programme for Government to open up the [Estimates and budgetary] process to wider public and parliamentary scrutiny.\"  I also said, \"I do not profess to have a monopoly of knowledge\" in constructing Estimates that keep within the very tight Expenditure parameters set in the Government's comprehensive expenditure review of December 2011.  Sadly, these parameters are necessarily tight, if we are to emerge from the current international programme of financial support and regain our economic sovereignty.<\/p><p>  While the Government is ultimately responsible for preparing the Estimates of expenditure for 2013, I am happy to take advice on how we can go about this task with regard to educational expenditure.  Therefore, I look forward to discussing these matters with the committee and receiving any input members may make in this regard.  I hope the material my officials have provided for the committee will assist the discussion.<\/p> <p>I propose to elaborate only briefly on the slides that were provided with the briefings, with the focus being on current expenditure.  Committee members will also have received copies of the report produced by the Department as part of last year's comprehensive expenditure review process.  The comprehensive expenditure review, CER, process has provided the basis for the medium-term expenditure framework for the period 2012-14.  It set expenditure ceilings for each Department for that period.  The task facing me and my Department for 2013 is to identify and implement the further savings measures that are necessary to keep expenditure within the CER ceiling as well as containing any further upward pressures, specifically demographic pressures on expenditure that may arise in the meantime.<\/p><p> I also mentioned in April that the 2013 Estimates for the Department will be based fully on the new performance budgeting format that was agreed by Government.  The performance budgeting approach, by including specific information about the outputs and outcomes that will be delivered with the Estimates funding, alongside the more traditional information on expenditure, is designed to increase the focus on what is actually being delivered with public funds.  This is to be welcomed.<\/p><p> Committee members will see from the first slide that budget 2012 shows the identification of savings measures amounting to approximately &euro;132 million on the Education and Skills Vote in 2012, increasing to &euro;206 million in 2013.  These measures, which are summarised in the briefing material provided, none of which were easy to implement, did two things.  First, they met the comprehensive expenditure review target of &euro;76 million in savings for 2012, which were necessary to live within the voted current expenditure ceiling of &euro;8,242 million.<\/p><p> Second, they also provided savings to fund important new initiatives and offset costs emerging on various areas of the Vote.  These new initiatives included the literacy and numeracy strategy in schools, junior certificate reform and the roll-out of the 100 megabyte broadband to second level schools.  The main upward pressures emerging were costs under the redress scheme as a result of the surge in applications received by the new closing date of last year.  However, notwithstanding the saving that budget 2012 measures will deliver, one will see that in order to manage within a current expenditure ceiling of &euro;8,165 million for 2013, I am obliged to identify a further set of measures to yield &euro;77 million in savings next year.<\/p><p> This is before taking account of any further upward pressures on expenditure that may emerge in 2013.  There are some indications that our allocation for teacher pay costs may be under pressure.  A further area of uncertainty for 2013 will be the position regarding superannuation expenditures.  Projections for superannuation expenditure in 2012 are putting very significant upward pressure on this year's allocation, due in large part to the increased number of retirements that took place in the early part of the year before the 29 February 2012.  The Department is working hard to identify measures that can offset this upward pressure and the situation must be monitored very closely again for next year.<\/p><p> Finding further current expenditure savings next year of &euro;77 million and containing upward pressures will be a significant challenge.  The slides provide some idea of the scale of this challenge.  Almost 78% of current expenditure of the Department is on pay and pensions, which covers the pay costs of just under 95,000 staff and goes towards the superannuation costs of approximately 38,000 pensioners.<\/p><p> In a situation where there is limited scope to reduce pay expenditure, especially given the continuing upward demographic pressures that have been summarised in the briefing material, much of the focus falls on those areas of non-pay expenditure on the Vote.  The main components of non-pay expenditure are set out in the briefing material which also shows that effectively all elements of this non-pay expenditure have taken a hit as part of the range of budget savings and efficiency measures introduced over the past number of years by this and by the previous Administration.  As I already indicated, few of these measures have been implemented without pain.  I am very conscious of the need as far as possible to protect front-line education services, particularly for the most disadvantaged.<\/p><p> I must, however, accept the reality, as we all do, that failure to meet public expenditure targets now will have much more serious implications in the years ahead, including for our continued ability to maintain high quality education services into the future.  It is certainly not the most favourable backdrop against which to formulate an education budget but we have a duty to act today in order to secure tomorrow.<\/p><p> Aside from the pressing need to make savings in day-to-day expenditure, the Government is also committed to reducing the numbers employed in the public service.  I am increasingly of the view that this is perhaps the biggest challenge for our education system in the coming years.  Our education workforce overwhelmingly consists of teachers, lecturers, special needs assistants and support staff.  The challenge will be to deliver the same level of public services with fewer staff.  In addition, the demographic boom in children which our country is experiencing at present will mean the demand for education is only going to increase.<\/p><p> As a social democrat, I did not enter politics with an ideological ambition to reduce the level of services in our education system.  However, if we did not have a cataclysmic economic crisis in Ireland, we would still be facing some very difficult choices in education spending in the years ahead.  We have a growing demand for services and self-evidently we have limited resources.  It is a national tragedy that the grossly negligent handling of our country's public finances by previous Fianna F&aacute;il Governments have added to our list of woes in this regard.<\/p><p> When I was Minister for Finance in the 1990s, I firmly believed we had to have a mixed social economy which was competitive, where we lived within our means, but where we delivered public services that helped and delivered for all in our society.  That challenge was ignored for 14 years but it did not go away.  We have to make up for lost time during a very difficult and painful balance sheet recession and where our membership of the eurozone has removed some of the tools we had in the past to restore our economic fortunes. <\/p><p> Though I am a heartfelt advocate of Keynesian economics, we simply cannot continue to borrow each year significantly more than we take in through revenue.  It is not a sustainable model and if unchecked will have much more far-reaching consequences in the years ahead.<\/p><p> The process of shaping the budget for 2013 is under way.  I will be bringing proposals to Government as to how my Department can deliver an Estimate for next year that will remain within the expenditure target set under the comprehensive expenditure review.  I am exploring with officials all areas of expenditure and drawing on the CER report which was produced by the Department last September in this regard.  Deputies and Senators will recall that last December I tried to give the education system some certainty by announcing some multi-annual reductions to allow schools and colleges and parents and students to plan for the years ahead.  I have no choice but to maintain the reduced capitation grants announced for primary and post-primary schools and pay and non-pay funding for higher education institutions.<\/p><p> Similarly, in relation to the teacher allocations for small schools with four teachers or less, I announced a three-year phased adjustment to the pupil-teacher ratios last December.<\/p><p> The four-year plan of reductions in language support teacher numbers announced by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government in 2010 will unfortunately continue.  Despite these reductions there still remains a challenge of finding &euro;77 million of savings in 2013 as well as containing the costs of emerging upward pressure.  It is important to remember that without the measures I have referred to the target required for next year would be even bigger.<\/p><p> Aside from these measures, I realise the Government must strive to be fair and to ensure the burden is shared equally.  It is important for social solidarity that those who have the most provide a bigger share of the contribution to our recovery.  I am sure this is a sentiment that all members present will agree with.  Such is the scale of the challenge that everyone must make some contribution and the debate should be based on the acceptance of that fact.<\/p><p> I would strongly encourage each and every member to read the outputs from the comprehensive expenditure review process in the coming weeks and months.  They list a wide range of options for current expenditure savings that are open to the Government to consider.  Much as I wish, there is no magic list of easier alternative savings hidden somewhere in Marlborough Street.<\/p><p> Chairman, I am happy to hear the views of members today and I look forward to having a constructive, frank and rigorous debate on the decisions that must be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900003#B00300","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348045500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I look forward to working with him on what is an extremely important Department.  I thank him for taking the opportunity to appear before the committee well in advance of the budgetary negotiations to outline his position.<\/p><p>  Education has to be a important aspect of our future economic foundation and of a strong and healthy society.  As such it is one of the key areas that must be protected in the current environment where there are many budgetary pressures.  We are aware of the effects that the cuts introduced in the past and those introduced by the Minister last year have had on the education system.  Given that pay and pensions account for 78% of spending, I understand the difficulty for the current side of expenditure.  <\/p><p>  Some of the initiatives announced by the Minister last year were disappointing in light of commitments given by him previously, particularly the decision to remove the maintenance grant to students, one third of whom benefited in the past and, as a result, would have been exempt from fees.  I raised the issue in the House yesterday as well as the issue of the post graduate loan deal which the Minister has endorsed from the Bank of Ireland, which is the only source for many of those students to fund their post graduate education at a high interest rate of 10.8%.  As I said yesterday, that was a poor deal on behalf of the Minister given that he encouraged students to take up that loan.<\/p><p>  In regard to the &euro;77 million the Minister is seeking to find in this year's budget from current expenditure, how much of that amount includes initiatives already announced, such as continuing decreases to capitation fees to schools and the student registration fee, which he plans to increase by &euro;250 in the next two to three years, and additional initiatives?<\/p><p>  What is the Minister's position on maintenance grants?  Prior to the last general election, the Labour Party and Fine Gael indicated they would establish a student loan facility.  What is the Government's policy on that issue?  Will the Minister give an assurance there will be no change to the maintenance grants system for undergraduate students, given the additional pressures on families due to increased fees?  <\/p><p>  On the issue of special needs, last year and this year there have been real difficulties at primary level for students who need that additional assistance to keep up and stay within the education system.  What are the Minister's plans for special needs students in the budget to ensure they will be protected?<\/p><p>  In regard to changes made to the school transport scheme last year, following a query to the Department we were unable to ascertain the budgetary savings.  In fact, the response from the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, in the House was that it was not yet possible to be clear as to what the savings might be.  The changes I refer to are that students are required to travel to their nearest school only.  I ask the Minister to revisit that issue as in many cases there will be no saving to the Department.  The number of families affected is relatively small but it is causing a real difficulty to them with no real budgetary impact.  It is within the Minister's power to address the issue in the run-up to the budget.<\/p><p>  An issue which has been topical in recent days is the Minister's response to the move by Clare County Council to attach payment of the household charge to the issuing of a third level grant.  The Minister's casual response was irresponsible.  In effect, he is abdicating responsibility for determining the terms of the maintenance grant to local authorities whose role is to administer it.  The job of deciding who is eligible for a maintenance grant is that of the Minister.  When a county council, whose role is to administer it, decides to attach additional conditions to it, and the Minister's response is that it is okay, that is an irresponsible approach.  Why should that be a condition in one council area and not in others?  Why should it be a condition in Clare but not a  condition for applying to the Student Universal Support System, SUSI, administered by the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900005#D00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1348046100,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I invite the Deputy to conclude as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900005#D00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1348046100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Where does one draw the line?

Some of the questions will be similar.  I welcome the Minister to the committee and look forward to working with him in the coming months and years.  There is no doubt he has a difficult job and there are huge challenges within the education portfolio to overcome.  I will be as constructive as possible but will also be critical when the need arises.  It is not only my job to offer alternatives but also to keep the Minister to account.<\/p><p>  I understand the &euro;77 million saving will be outside the multi-annual announcements made last year in respect of capitation grants and reductions to language support teachers.  The challenge facing the Department in trying to find the &euro;77 million is evident.  In regard to capitation grants, has the Department carried out an assessment of the impact the announcement had last year?  Some schools, including those attended by my children, are being asked to take with them basic items such as toilet rolls because schools no longer provide basic toiletries.  That gives a sense of the pressure under which some schools operate.  As there will be a further reduction in the capitation grants next year, this will start to affect front-line services.<\/p> <p>Front-line services will be affected by the ongoing cuts to services.  The financial cost of sending children to school is increasing.  A review of the book lending scheme took place and a voluntary code of practice was put in place.  This is not the meeting at which to discuss the issue but I would like to hear the Minister's views on how the voluntary code of practice is working, the buy-in and the tangible benefits arising.<\/p><p>  In January, the Minister asked his officials to examine the whole area of fee-paying schools.  Will he give the committee an update on its report and the outcome?<\/p><p> Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of the post primary school transport scheme.  The way in which the scheme was implemented this year was a disaster.  Parents made decisions in November 2011 on the schools their children would attend, yet five months later they received notification stating they would not qualify due to changes in the scheme.  I am aware of a couple whose two children attend the same post primary school, one qualified because of being in the scheme already while the second child did not qualify.  One had the option of availing of the school transport scheme while the other child has to be driven to school.  Such situations on the ground create problems. <\/p><p> In regard to the &euro;77 million saving, has the Minister identified areas, red-line issues, that he will not touch because of previous announcements in respect of cuts in that area or in terms of the multi-annual cut in funding?  It would be easier to identify the areas not being considered than the areas being considered.  Will the Minister indicate the areas that will have to be examined this year which would not impact on the most disadvantaged?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900005#D00500","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348046700,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions and comments.  With regard to third level fees, the so-called student charge, which has been rebranded for what it is, was &euro;2,000 when the Government came into office.  It was increased by &euro;250 last year and will increase again by the same amount, to a maximum of &euro;3,000.  The revenue from increasing it by &euro;250 this year amounts to approximately &euro;18 million, which is a considerable amount of money.  Some 42% of students in the university and third level college system are in receipt of some form of grant, either the full grant and maintenance or a partial grant.<\/p><p>  As Opposition spokesperson on education for Fine Gael, Deputy Brian Hayes, now Minister of State at the Department of Finance, said his party was in favour of a student loan system.  I took that to mean, subject to correction, that it would be a State student loan scheme similar to that in place in other in other countries.  The loan scheme introduced by Bank of Ireland, to which Deputy McConalogue referred, is one on which it has taken the initiative.  I welcomed its appearance in the system.  Prior to that one could get a bank loan as a student but it depended on one's parents underwriting or going guarantor.  Subject to correction, under the bank loan scheme which Bank of Ireland has launched, the student services only the interest.  When students graduate and move to the labour market they pay back the capital.  The scheme is open to students in their own right and is not dependent on guarantees from other family members.  That is a welcome addition and as it comes without State underwriting or State guarantees, there is no exposure for the State.  It is not a Government-backed or a State-backed system.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that the introduction of changes to the school transport system for post-primary schools has created some distortions and difficulties.  I had a briefing meeting this morning with the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, who is directly responsible for it.  I am interested in feedback, particularly from Deputy McConalogue, who has a conscious experience from Donegal North-East of its impact.  My understanding is that the rule is confined.  If one is entitled to it, one gets free transport to the nearest school but if, for whatever reason, one sends one child to a school further away than the nearest school, one is not entitled to transport and must pay a concessionary fee.  The displacement in that area is comparatively small, according to the briefing I received, but it is acute for the families directly affected.  We will look at amelioration measures when we have got a better quantification.  The schools reopened only three weeks ago and we are still trying to get information.  If Members have typical cases it would be useful for us to get them and we can examine whether there are ways of ameliorating the scheme.  For example, if there is spare capacity on the bus, and we know the pattern, then some movement should be facilitated.  The Minister of State and his officials said they are still evaluating the impact and the feedback from people around the country.  If Members have specific information we would be happy to hear it.<\/p><p>  At 7.50 a.m. yesterday on my way to Government Buildings, I was asked about the decision taken by Clare County Council about payment of the household charge.  I was not aware of it at the time and had not been consulted.  I understand Tipperary County Council proposes to similar course of action.  We must be clear about this.  Nobody likes paying taxes.  This is a specific tax that has provoked co-ordinated opposition from political groups and individuals across the country.  Approximately two thirds of the population has paid the tax.  In the case of Clare County Council, a person was seeking taxpayers' money to go to college but that taxpayers' money has to come from those who pay the tax,  It is a legal requirement that one pays the tax; it is not a voluntary contribution.  It was quite reasonable for Clare County Council to ask if one's household had paid the tax.  To my knowledge, it did not say any more. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900006#E00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1348046700,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The letter states that in order to progress the first payment of the instalment the council will need proof of payment of the household charge.

The sum of &euro;77 million is additional moneys that I must find.  Any changes that we make in the education budget in December will have an impact in September 2013 and for the following academic year.  If a reduction is made by savings, we can only collect one third of it in 2013.  Any changes I make in December will provide one third of the savings over the December 2012 to September 2013 period and two thirds thereafter.  It lowers the burden in one sense.  The amount of savings, in some cases, is only one third and I hope that the Deputy can see the obvious reason for that.<\/p><p>  The impact a reduction in capitation grant has on schools is uneven.  In many cases we do not know what schools have.  We have been told that some schools have savings.  Other schools virtually live from hand to mouth and the Deputy's description is an indication of that.  We are trying to assist schools in terms of public procurement where together they can receive discounts by virtue of their purchasing power, and we will explore further options.  We have already introduced facilities to allow the joint purchase of electricity.  As each school is a stand-alone island at the moment. one depends on the co-operation of management bodies.  As many as 92% of the schools come under the remit of the Catholic Primary School Management Association.  We are trying to encourage the schools to use their combined purchasing power to reduce some of their costs and that is the direction we are taking.  Obviously, the issue of toiletries referred to is not the same as savings on electricity costs.  In the future I would see the new education and training boards as having a role at regional level.  There will be 16 boards across the country and they will play a role in facilitating cost-cutting for schools in their area.  For example, there could be 200 or 300 primary schools in a local education and training board area.  The schools could combine administratively and use their collective purchasing power to secure discounts to offset some of the impact - but not all of the impact - of a reduction in capitation grants.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the book lending scheme, we have a code of practice but I am not sure if members have the details.  We have a commitment from the publishers that they will not arbitrarily change the texts of some of the books for a new edition and they will keep books in print for a period to reduce the cost of school books at primary and second levels.       <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900007#F02500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047300,"counter":47,"content":"<p>It happens all of the time and the scheme is not working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900007#F02600","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047300,"counter":48,"content":"<p>If it is not working then I ask the Senator to bring the instance to my attention and we can contact the publishers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900007#F02700","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047300,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900007#F02800","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Should we be talking about a book lending scheme or getting the intellectual copyright of a lot of the stuff to download it for free to whatever device a student uses?We are in a Gutenberg moment where devices will change.<\/p><p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked me other questions about fee-paying schools.  The free voluntary scheme is what it says on the tin.  All second level schools charged fees up until 1966 or 1967.  Donogh O'Malley introduced a scheme whereby voluntary schools could not be compelled to opt into the system - I am talking about 730 post primary schools in total.  The scheme also provided that the fees would be eliminated and that the Government would pay a capitation grant in lieu.  At the time 56 schools stayed out of the system.  At the moment we have 56 fee-paying schools, 22 of which are under the patronage of the reformed church and Protestant community.  As the Deputy mentioned, we have asked them to provide an account and, speaking from memory, the figure that the schools receive collectively is of the order of &euro;120 million.  We have asked them to give us an account of what they do with that money.  We are analysing a significant number of their responses but we have not received them all.  Such analysis will inform my response when deciding the budget for the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900007#F02900","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047300,"counter":51,"content":"<p>As the Minister must leave at 11.30 a.m. perhaps he will wait until the next couple of questioners make their contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900007#F03000","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047300,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Yes.

They support the case that he has made for a long time about the increase in student numbers.  He has a strong case because he has 95,000 whole-time equivalent staff in the system and in 2013 there will be 1,235 extra staff needed at primary and second level and more than 4,000 extra students at third level.  Providing a service for all of this will come at an enormous cost to the system and yet he needs to find &euro;77 million.  On his behalf I shall plant a few seeds in the mind of the Minister for Finance by saying that the Minister for Education and Skills should be asked to make a smaller reduction.  Obviously, I can see the dilemma that he is faced with because 78% of his budget is spent on pay and pensions which only leaves him with 22% to pay for the service.  Unless there is a service provided there will be no education.  I ask him to examine the strong case that he can make for a smaller reduction.<\/p> <p> The Minister indicated that the allocation for teacher pay costs may be under pressure.  I ask him to elaborate a little on that comment, specifically, allowances and increments, which are the elephant in the room.  What percentage of the pay bill is allocated towards allowances and increments?  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, did a very bad job on allowances yesterday.  Although I am in favour of protecting pay, this should not necessarily include allowances and increments.  I made a case to the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party on the issue of increments, about which Deputy Harris has also spoken, in which I argued against paying increments to staff in the public service earning more than &euro;55,000 per annum.  I ask the Minister to justify the payment of increments to staff earning more than that figure in a recession.  I chose the figure of &euro;55,000 after consulting Social Justice Ireland and the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, on poverty-proofing a family of two adults and four children, which is a relatively large family by today's standards.  I ask the Minister to comment on the issue of increments.<\/p><p> There has been speculation that the Minister will consider increasing the length of the school day and school year to achieve better efficiencies in the system.  One may ask how this will save money, although I accept it could have an effect on teacher performance.  However, primary school children may not have the capacity to learn more if the school day is extended.  I know this from personal experience.  I accept that extending the school day at secondary level could result in more classes being taught.  Other than teacher performance issues, how would such a measure save money?<\/p><p> Over the weekend, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, agreed a deal with hospital consultants, the group that enjoys the highest levels of pay in the health service.  Has the Minister considered trying to secure a similar deal with senior lecturers, university heads and other staff in third level education who earn in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum?<\/p><p> Does the Minister envisage increasing the pupil-teacher ratio this year, a measure that would result in further cuts in teacher numbers?  Last year was very difficult, particularly in small rural schools.  I am aware that a plan is in place in this regard and do not expect the Minister to return to this issue as it may be a red-line issue.  Does the Minister envisage introducing further cuts in teacher numbers this year?<\/p><p> I seek clarification on one further minor matter.  Referring to the rate of capitation at second level, the Minister alluded to a school services support fund of &euro;201 per pupil.  What precisely is this fund?  <\/p><p> The allocation for the literacy and numeracy strategy is &euro;7 million in 2012 and &euro;6 million in 2012.  How is this money spent?  What extra benefits does it deliver to schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900007#F03500","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348047900,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed presentation which sets out in a sobering and stark manner the challenges facing Members of the Oireachtas and those working in the education system.  Many of my questions relate to the need to face up to the reality and knowledge that we must spend the funds available to us well.  With this in mind, I will start with a question on special needs education.  While I do not advocate any reduction in the number of special needs assistants, I have been a long-time critic of the criteria ascribed to the role of special needs assistants.  Many special needs assistants are not being utilised or are not in a position to be utilised owing to the criteria laid down by the Department.  In some cases, they are paid a salary roughly equivalent to a new entrant teacher, yet the tasks they must perform under these criteria include tidying up the classroom at the end of the day.  A wide range of people work as special needs assistants.  Some have obtained a junior certificate while others have master's degrees and every type of intermediate qualification.  This issue needs to be examined.<\/p><p>  I am aware that the Department, through the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is expecting to receive advice on special educational needs policy.  That this policy has not been reviewed since 1993 is an outright disgrace.  It is exciting and helpful that the NCSE is carrying out the review.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on progress.  As he stated, despite spending a great deal on special educational needs, we are not getting the full bang for our buck in many cases. <\/p><p>  The issue of public sector allowances arose yesterday.  I note that one of the allowances to be discontinued for new entrants to the teaching profession is the qualifications allowance.  Considering that we want those who teach our children and prepare them for participation in the labour force to be the best and brightest, how will discontinuing this allowance fit in with the need to incentivise teachers to upskill and constantly learn new skills?  While I accept that the allowance may be too broad and encompass too many areas, it could be targeted at improving the skills we want teachers to bring into the classroom.  Understanding that the Minister may not be able to do this at this point, I ask him to outline his position on the matter, at least from an ideological point of view. <\/p><p>  What are we teaching our children?  The responses I have received to a number of parliamentary questions I have tabled on the teaching of information technology and so forth suggest everything is rosy in garden, various programmes are in place and so forth.  I visited the Digital Hub in Dublin and it is clear that the people who are creating jobs do not believe this is the case.  The PayPal company, for example, has been unable to find recruits to fill 1,000 positions in County Louth.  We talk about a smart economy but a EUROSTAT survey shows that Irish people between the ages of 16 and 24 years are below the European average for computer literacy.  The time spent in the classroom and the subject matter being taught are important.  <\/p><p>  Everybody should pay the household charge and it is logical that those who refuse to do so should not expect to receive the most efficient service from their local authority.  I am concerned, however, about the lack of legal basis for the approach taken by Clare County Council in linking payment of the charge with the payment of third level grants and the geographical inconsistency of its approach.  The Department needs to examine this issue.  If Clare County Council's approach is to be the rule, it should be prescribed in regulation or legislation.  If not, local authorities should not take the law into their own hands.  Clarity is needed on this matter. <\/p><p>  On the Croke Park agreement, if teachers receive allowances which are effectively core pay, as I believe to be the case, when will these allowances be described as pay?  If, for example, yard duty allowance forms part of pay, it should be described as such. <\/p><p>  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts I asked representatives of the Health Service Executive how many of its staff are earning more than &euro;70,000 per annum, how many of this group are receiving increments this year and what will be the cost of these increments.  As policy makers frame their budget and as we move towards the conclusion of the Croke Park agreement, we need to have this type of data available to us.  Is such data available for the Department of Education and Skills and, if so, will the Minister make it available to us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900008#G00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047900,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and for appearing before the joint committee so far in advance of the budget.  I appreciate that he has a difficult job to do.  Responsibility for protecting education should not be solely the task of the Minister but should extend to everyone who sits around the Cabinet table because the impact of some cuts in the Department are felt across other areas.  Moreover, the costs are often many times the savings achieved.  We saw this last year with the cuts imposed on disadvantaged schools where the potential long-term costs to the social welfare and justice systems are far greater than the initial savings.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harris referred to PayPal and problems it is experiencing in the area of information technology.  Strong criticism has also been made of cuts in the modern languages programme.  Companies such as PayPal argue that Irish people are losing jobs because industries cannot find people with language skills.  As a result, firms based here as a result of valuable multinational investment are hiring recruits elsewhere while people here are being paid social welfare benefits.  I fail to understand how cutting the modern languages initiative made economic sense from a multi-departmental point of view.  Ahead of the budget, what procedures are in place in the Department and across government to ensure cuts of this nature are considered on a cross-departmental basis and a proper cost-benefit analysis is done on the overall costs to the State, including whether the cuts will result in costs several times higher than the savings to be achieved in the Department's budget?<\/p> <p> There has been much discussion about the actions of Clare County Council here this morning.  The reason it is a budgetary matter is that the Minister is the one who is legally exposed.  Because the Minister has the delegated authority, which is then passed on to the administering bodies, for the grant scheme, if somebody takes a case it would be against the Department.  If the Minister had provided cover for an illegal act of an administrative body, then he is exposed.  For the information of Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, that is why it is a budgetary matter and it is something that should be discussed here.  If money is wasted on such legal cases, it is not available for special needs education, disadvantaged schools or other areas.<\/p><p> There was commentary by legal experts in the newspapers this morning on the fact that the Government is penalising one person for the actions of another.  I would share the view that everybody should pay the household charge.  It is grossly irresponsible for Members of the D&aacute;il, although they may have made a case against the charge, to encourage non-payment. It was democratically voted through the D&aacute;il.  My party had issues with it, but it was voted through and it should be paid.  I have no difficulty with that.  If the person being penalised was the person who had not paid it, many would say it was fair enough.  Many who have paid it wished they did not have to, were under massive pressure to do so and had to save over a few weeks to be able to afford it, and it is difficult for them to turn around and see others get away with not doing so.  There is an equity issue in that regard in general but one cannot penalise one person for the actions of another.  I do not see how there is any basis legally for penalising students over 18 for their parents, not having paid the charge.  Will the Minister for Education and Science ensure that he gets legal advice as to any potential exposure he might have in this issue?<\/p><p> We discussed the issue of vetting in the Seanad before the summer recess and the Minister gave a commitment that he would discuss it with other Cabinet colleagues.  In the context of flexibility, I appreciate there is the employment control framework, but the Teaching Council has the funding.  The Teaching Council is a self-financing body and it is not sensible not to let it spend the funding available.  I ask the Minister to give us an update on the position and whether that issue has been resolved over the summer.<\/p><p> The report on fee-paying schools will be published.  I wonder whether that will involve a sensitivity analysis of what different options might be.  Nobody would advocate that the Minister would withdraw funding overnight.  Certainly, there would be an economic cost to that because if students move from one school to another, it will cost the State system more.  Perhaps the Minister needs to be at least publishing and allowing a public debate on options such as a phased withdrawal over a number of years.  Considering the social cost, perhaps there is a saving in a pure economic sense in terms of the reduced capitation fee and such matters.  Education is not only about what is on the curriculum; it is about the social interaction in a school.  Every child should go to school with children whose parents earn much more and with children whose parents earn much less.  The effect of the present system is this does not happen.  I would like to know the level of detail the Minister would expect to be put into the public domain so that we can have a proper debate on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900008#G00300","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348048500,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I will call the last couple of speakers who indicated, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senator Moloney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900009#H00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1348048500,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's attendance to discuss the budget with plenty of advance notice.<\/p><p>  I will touch on a few of the issues and perhaps the Minister can give me some response.

He made a valid point about the way second level is going, with technology like tablets and digitisation.  Such a scheme could have a major impact on the cost savings for parents.  Where is the Department on that and what is its potential cost?<\/p><p>  Is there an education audit right across the system?  Often campaigns or issues within the education system are politically convenient but when one strips them down to look at their educational value, sometimes a case can be made for one or another.  Does that happen in terms of issues such as modern languages or class size?  Where a lobby group is making a strong case, what systems or mechanisms are there within the Department to state what international research shows?<\/p><p>  Returning to the ability of principals to manage their schools, about which Deputy O'Brien spoke, the compartmentalisation of grants to schools and the autonomy of a principal to make a decision on how to run his or her school the way he or she wants in tandem with the board of management, one may get a block grant for IT which one may not need and would much rather spend on day-to-day items such as toiletries.  The Minister might comment on moving towards a system where the principal would have the autonomy to make those decisions.<\/p><p>  I will return to the Minister on the special needs issue.  I still have major concerns about GAM and that funding is not targeted at the most disadvantaged, but this is probably not the proper forum in which to raise that issue.<\/p><p>  Senator Healy Eames touched on the reform packages.  In terms of the literacy initiatives, the forum on patronage and pluralism and all of the reforms that the Department is thankfully carrying out, it is quite an exciting time to be involved in education.  Is the added cost of doing all of this a major budgetary item?  Does it have a major impact on the spend of the Department?  When the Minister rolls out a new scheme or initiative, he takes on a vested interest or he takes on a body of work that has been left untouched for a period of time and there is a cost involved.  Is it a major or minor cost?  Is it something that we need to focus on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900009#H00300","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1348048500,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking the time to brief us.  Many of my points have already been covered.  When one gets to the end of the pile, it has been done.  I will merely touch on a few matters.<\/p><p>  The SNA is what it says, a special needs assistant.  It is an assistant for a child with special needs, not an assistant to clean up the classroom or to do other things.  The role of the SNA must be looked at and defined better.  With that, we may be able to utilise the services of an SNA for more than one child in the classroom rather than having them cleaning up the classroom.  I am sure the Minister will look at that.  Fee-paying schools is an issue but we will await the report on that.<\/p><p>  The Minister asked for suggestions as to how money could be saved.  I am not sure whether this will save money but it should not happen.  I refer to the re-employment of retired teachers to supervise examinations.  Last year 1,100 retired teachers came back to supervise examinations.  It is a scandal.  When there are young teachers crying out for jobs, one should not bring retired teachers back into the classroom.  That practice should be done away with.  The Department should hire the younger teachers and save them leaving the country.<\/p><p>  As in the case of the consultants, perhaps an approach should be made to the lecturers about their fees.  If we must go into conciliation, the Minister should do so.  He should approach them anyway and look at reducing their fees.<\/p><p>  Some schools conduct book rental schemes and others do not.  Parents are suffering because of the high cost of books.<\/p><p>  The Minister mentioned that the student contribution would come to a maximum of &euro;3,000.  Is that &euro;3,000 for the year or &euro;3,000 over the programme for Government?  Is that the maximum increase there will be or is it merely the maximum for the coming year?<\/p><p>  I am glad the Minister will look at school transport.  I have come across similar instances of one child going on the bus free and the other not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900009#H00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1348048500,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I will try to go through this as quickly as possible and give factual responses.<\/p><p>  Basic pay for primary schools, as distinct from increments, is 72% of expenditure, and it is the same for school teachers.  Where we will go with this is set in the context of a new pay agreement, the second Croke Park agreement.  In the Civil Service, one comes in at a recruitment grade of executive officer and if one gets promotion to higher executive officer, one gets additional responsibilities and an additional workload.  In the public service, something similar would be ideal, so that if one gets to be an assistant principal or gets a particular role, the salary increase would automatically involve corresponding responsibilities.<\/p> <p>The system is a very old one.

We are looking at the breakdown in the allocation of time for resource teachers and special needs teachers, as well as the role of the SNA.  It is time to review it and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the section within the Department with responsibility in this area are undertaking that study.  I will communicate with the committee on the outcome of that and perhaps members might like to engage with the NCSE directly on it.<\/p><p>  There is no change to the pupil-teacher ratios in small schools.  They are as they were announced last year and we are not doing anything more in that area.  On the issue of technology, the rate of change in the world of technology is such that most young people probably know more than a middle-aged teacher about technology as it stands.  It is probably the case that the pupils could teach the teachers, rather than the other way around.  However, in so far as we have an up-to-date position on it, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA's, ICT framework, which offers a structured approach to the use of ICT in curriculum and assessment, has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools.  It deals with digital literacy, which is an integral part of a student's ongoing education.  To be honest with the Deputy, at a family gathering last August, a grandniece of mine, who is 18 months old, picked up a Nokia mobile telephone, which was not a smartphone.  She kept running her hand over the screen and was wondering why nothing was happening.  <\/p><p>  It is a bit like the book rental scheme.  We could invest an awful lot of money in a book rental scheme and find that, in ten years time, the iPad has replaced all of them.  Books are very expensive.  We spend &euro;50 million per year on the book grant and it is of limited value.  Therefore, I would hesitate to invest in a technology that could be replaced very quickly.  We are at what I call the Gutenberg tipping moment, which. looking back in history, occurred at one point in time, but we all know with technological change that things get phased in and phased out.  <\/p><p>  Senator Power asked about the languages initiative, which was a pilot programme involving about 800 schools teaching modern languages to pupils in fifth and sixth class.  It was not rolled out or mainstreamed because it was not considered by the NCEA to be very effective.  There is an argument that for many primary school teachers, there is already curriculum overload.  <br \/> Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about the special cost of reform policies, particularly with regard to literacy and numeracy.  The total full-year cost for literacy and numeracy programmes was &euro;19 million, which I had to find last year by various means, one of which was closing down the languages initiative.  Apologies - the cost this year was &euro;6 million, next year it will be &euro;7 million and in a full year, it will reach &euro;19 million.  That figure includes the cost of the extra year's education for primary school teachers and the extra year for the higher diploma too.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of the roll-out of broadband, 200 secondary schools will get the full 100 Mb connection this year, another 200 will be connected next year and a further 200 the following year.  There are many schools in urban areas that are already connected so every school at second level will be fully connected by the end of the programme.  That capacity will enable them to deal with an enormous amount of traffic.  The cost of that will be &euro;10 million in a full year.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has the capital to install the broadband and is maintaining the service charge for a number of years, after which it will be the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills.  <\/p><p>  Senators referred to comments made by PayPal and others regarding recruitment difficulties.  PayPal representatives have admitted - I have this second-hand, so it is subject to a health warning - that in many cases they were looking for native speakers of a foreign language because of the nature of the transactions being processed.  We are still receiving their income tax and their spending in the economy.  I would prefer if the jobs were filled by local people here, obviously, but there is an economic gain from their presence here.  <\/p><p>  Members referred to the Teaching Council. Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, which requires that a teacher must be registered with the Teaching Council in order to be paid from public moneys, will be activated.  There are some edges of ambiguity as to who is qualified as a teacher, particularly in the further education and VEC sectors.  There is no ambiguity in primary and secondary schools.  I do not want anybody to be arbitrarily cutoff the payroll as a result of not being qualified and we are in active discussions with Tom&aacute;s <font color=\"#222222\">&Oacute;<\/font> Ruairc<font color=\"#222222\"> <\/font>of the Teaching Council to sort that out.  As and when the section is activated, a teacher, in order to be paid, will have to be registered with the Teaching Council, and a condition of registration will be continuous professional development.  In other words, teachers will be in the same category as accountants, doctors, architects, solicitors and others.  It will be up to the new Teaching Council, appointed earlier this year, to set the priorities in continual professional development but I hope it will concentrate on upskilling and ensuring that teachers who are in the system for some years are properly trained to do the job they are supposed to do.  The council has a lot of money at its disposal because of the charges it collects, although it has reduced the charge to teachers recently.  I am working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to overcome the impediment that is the employment control framework to enable the council to employ extra staff, which it would be in a position to pay for itself.  <\/p><p>  Members asked about the fee-paying schools and we are waiting to see what they are doing with the money.  We have a growing school-going population.  In some cases, fee-paying schools have not been receiving capital grants for school accommodation.  I want to ascertain whether they have large amounts of cash they are using for extra teachers or whether, in fact, they are paying off large mortgages for school buildings.  As soon I get that information I will publish it so it will be a matter for public discussion at that point.<\/p><p>  A question was posed regarding the possibility of lengthening the school day and the potential impact that might have.  We have 730 post-primary schools.  The new schools that we are building now have a population of between 800 and 1,000.  That enables a full curriculum menu to be made available.  In secondary schools with fewer than 300 pupils, if one disimproves the pupil-teacher ratio, one could potentially remove a subject from the menu of options.  It is a truism, as the Senator knows, that primary school teachers teach children while secondary school teachers teach subjects.  The impact could be quite arbitrary with the last-in, first-out system, so there is a sensitivity issue.  A longer working day is a matter for negotiation with the education stakeholders and the teachers' unions and the management bodies have been extremely flexible and co-operative, from my point of view.  I value that relationship and do not want to make arbitrary changes that would damage it.  At the same time, we really do need to get greater productivity and that is a true for everybody, whether in the private or public sector.  There is greater productivity in the public sector as we speak because the same delivery of service is occurring with far fewer staff.  If memory serves me, 18,000 have left the public service yet services are being maintained.<\/p> <p>It is just a fact of life that we are-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900010#J00800","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348049700,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Is it at second level that the Minister envisages this change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012091900011#K00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1348049700,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I am more constrained at second level because of the subject impact.

As always, it is a pleasure to have this opportunity to meet the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and to brief it ahead of this month's meeting of the General Affairs Council which will take place in Brussels on Monday, 24 September.  The General Affairs Council will meet for a morning session next Monday.  I will represent Ireland and will be joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.  The primary focus of the meeting will be the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, preparation of the October European Council and the European semester.  Over lunch, we will have a discussion on the working methods of the General Affairs Council.<\/p><p>  Discussions on the MFF will be based on an updated negotiating box which the Cypriot Presidency circulated yesterday evening.  It does not, as yet, contain figures.  These will probably not appear until after the October European Council.  As the committee is aware, negotiations on the MFF are intensifying.  The Cypriot Presidency and European Council President Van Rompuy want negotiations to conclude at the 22-23 November European Council.  We strongly support this timetable and we will do what we can to support the Cypriot Presidency in its efforts to broker a deal.  In any case, it will fall to us during our Presidency to steer underpinning sectoral legislation through the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  Our position on the MFF is quite clear.  As the committee knows, we want a properly funded and properly functioning EU, with the right mix of priorities, fair allocation of resources and a firm focus on jobs and growth.  We see a need for continued food security and safety, which warrants only gradual changes to the CAP.  We also have an express national interest in defending our share of CAP payments.  In particular, we want the MFF to reflect the importance of job creation as well as growth.  We have stressed to partners the importance of the agrifood sector for growth.<\/p><p>  While we are slowly approaching agreement on the MFF, it is clear there are still wide gaps between the positions of member states and there is a long way to go before we can get agreement on this dossier of vital importance for the medium-term future of the Union.  The key issues, and the most difficult ones, in the MFF negotiations in the coming months will be the overall size of the MFF, the relative proportions allocated to CAP, Cohesion and other headings, and the funding of the EU budget, including arrangements for rebates and corrections.<\/p><p>  The General Affairs Council will also prepare for the October European Council through consideration of the annotated draft agenda for that meeting which has been made available by President Van Rompuy.  He has identified three main issues for discussion, namely, economic policy, strategic partners and foreign policy issues in light of events.  Under the economic policy heading, President Van Rompuy will present his interim report to the European Council on strengthening Economic and Monetary Union, building on his first report prepared in collaboration with the Presidents of the Commission, the ECB and the Eurogroup in June.  His final report is due to be made before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  President Van Rompuy is investigating in more detail what might be required under the four headings he set out in June.  These are: an integrated financial framework, often referred to as \"banking union\"; greater economic policy co-ordination; more fiscal or budgetary integration; and democratic accountability and legitimacy.<\/p> <p>An essential process of consultation is now under way, with a round of official level bilateral meetings taking place this week &ndash; Ireland's bilateral will take place in Brussels tomorrow, 20 September &ndash; to be followed early next month by collective meeting of all member states with President Van Rompuy's team.<\/p><p> Of the elements President Van Rompuy is pursuing, banking union is being taken forward with real urgency.  The Commission made its formal proposals for a single supervisory mechanism for banks in the euro area last week.  Given the link between getting the concept of a supervisor off the ground and activating the possibility of the ESM directly recapitalising banks, there is a particular urgency to this work.  The June summit set an ambitious deadline of the end of this year.  This is, of course, an issue of importance for us, and President Van Rompuy has signalled that he wants the October European Council to assess progress being made and, as necessary, to set further orientations.  Like us, he wants to see what was agreed in June implemented.  Before concluding on this point, I would like to note that since the European Council and euro area summit meetings at the end of June, we have seen greater stability in the markets.  Key to this has been the decision of the ECB to adopt its outright monetary transactions initiative, which opens the possibility of its buying the bonds of member states in difficulties.<\/p><p> The decision of the German Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe on the ESM was also very positive and welcome.  The Commission's proposals on banking supervision have also contributed to a sense that we are getting to grips with what now needs to be done.  However, to maintain this sense of increased confidence, we need to press forward urgently with implementation of what was agreed at the end of June.  There can be no back-sliding.  Confidence is fragile and a lack of progress could easily set us back again.<\/p><p> In October, leaders will also take stock of progress in the implementation of the compact for growth and jobs which they agreed in June.  If required, they will set further orientations to promote growth and employment.  The compact for growth and jobs is important reinforcement of political commitment to an EU growth agenda.  The key task for us in the period ahead is driving it forward with real commitment and momentum.  This is a vital national interest.  Irish recovery depends on European recovery.<\/p><p> The compact provides a clear framework for actions at three levels: actions to be taken by member states; the contribution of European policies to growth; and EMU related growth factors.  Ireland has been among those pushing most strongly for accelerated progress on the Single Market in particular, including the digital single market, as well as highlighting the role of international trade as an engine for growth.  In particular, we look forward to the Commission's proposals for a new round of measures in the autumn under the Single Market Act, and to sustaining momentum in this area under next year's Irish Presidency.<\/p><p> There will also be a &euro;10 billion increase in the European Investment Bank's paid-in capital on foot of the June meeting.  This could expand the bank's lending capacity by some &euro;60 billion over the next three to four years, and unlock a further &euro;120 billion from other finance providers.  The key Irish concern is that the approach must be sufficiently flexible to target investment where it is most needed, including addressing the particular circumstances of programme countries.  This was the focus of our meeting with the new EIB president, Dr Werner Hoyer, when he visited Dublin on 6 July.  On foot of that meeting, we have we have set up a high level working group with the EIB to examine the full range of issues involved in strengthening its support for Ireland.  An initial report is expected in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> The October European Council will also discuss the EU's relations with key strategic partners.  President Van Rompuy is keen that EU leaders consider relations with strategic partners on a regular basis and provide high level guidance on important issues, as necessary.  While it is not anticipated that conclusions will be adopted on this issue, it will provide an opportunity for a free-flowing exchange of these critical relationships for the EU.  It can be expected that the October European Council may also address certain foreign policy issues, as required.<\/p><p> This meeting of the GAC will contribute to a review of the operation of the European semester, which is under way, that aims to identify lessons learned from the experience in 2012, including a particular focus on procedures for the handling of country-specific recommendations.  Given that Ireland will be presiding over the Council during the next European semester cycle, this exercise will be of particular interest to us.<\/p><p> Discussion will be on the basis of a paper prepared by the Cypriot Presidency.  The Commission has also made proposals for more regular and structured contacts with member states.  The second European semester cycle in 2012 operated under the enhanced economic governance arrangements introduced last December, and there was some disquiet about the preparatory arrangements in this regard.  Ireland's CSR in 2012, as in 2011, is to ensure continued implementation of our EU-IMF programme.  As the committee will be aware, the semester is the Union's annual cycle of economic and fiscal policy co-ordination and it is clearly growing in importance. The key aim is that policies implemented by member states reflect jointly agreed priorities.<\/p><p> The third semester cycle in 2013 is further reinforced by the compact for growth and jobs, as well as agreement in June that ESM assistance will be conditional on CSR implementation.  The focus of the Cypriot Presidency paper is on lessons learned in 2012.  It suggests that procedural improvements that might be considered include earlier presentation of the Commission's new alert mechanism report in November, alongside the annual growth survey; greater dialogue between the Commission and member states around the development of the Commission's CSR proposals, beginning with bilateral meetings in October taking stock of the 2012 CSRs; better organisation of the work of the committees supporting the ECOFIN and EPSCO Council formations, where there is important overlap on issues such as wage settlement, income tax and pensions policy; and the important Presidency role in striking an appropriate balance in this regard, including through greater involvement of COREPER ambassadors.<\/p><p> Initial discussion at next week's GAC will inform further consideration by both the EPSCO and ECOFIN Council formations.  Refreshed arrangements on foot of the review under way will then be reflected in an Irish Presidency roadmap for the third European semester cycle.  This is likely to be presented to the GAC in December.<\/p><p> Over lunch, Ministers will discuss the working methods of the GAC.  To focus discussions, the Cypriot Presidency has circulated a paper focusing on the key role of the GAC in ensuring consistency in the work of the different Council configurations and in preparing and following up the work of the European Council.  As the incoming Presidency in particular, we are especially interested in ensuring the GAC plays its full role in executing its responsibilities as regards the European Council, and we will be working closely with partners and with President Van Rompuy's office, as appropriate, to that end.  This timely lunchtime discussion on working methods arises, in part, in response to a joint letter sent to the Presidency in July by the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Creighton, along with her Finnish, Spanish and Italian colleagues.<\/p><p> The Cypriot Presidency has indicated that issue of the Roma community should be included on the agenda of this meeting of the GAC.  We expect that this will largely be an information point, as it is anticipated that the Commission will make a presentation on its evaluation of national efforts aimed at inclusion of the Roma population.  To this end, it will be noted that Ireland submitted its national Traveller-Roma integration strategy at the beginning of this year.<\/p><p> I appreciate the attention of members and I look forward to hearing their comments.  I will be very happy to respond to any of points or queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900002#A00500","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348074000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

The prospect of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, directly recapitalising banks is welcome and I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in pursuing that.  The compact for growth and jobs is critical to this country.  We have a risk of losing a generation of 17 to 25 year olds because they are experiencing 30% unemployment.  This is a huge issue and while we all accept the need for financial retrenchment and good economic management, as we saw in the recent referendum, they must be matched by active job creation activity from Europe and within the State.  I would be interested in hearing how optimistic the T&aacute;naiste is on that issue.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste identified the Common Agricultural Policy as critical to Ireland.  Is the T&aacute;naiste optimistic we can maintain the overall amount within the multi-annual financial framework?<\/p> <p>Can we maintain domestic discretion over the use of our envelope of money?  We are in the best position to know how to target our spending on areas of need, on agricultural production and on the 2020 objectives, which have job creation at their forefront.<\/p><p> I would like to raise a final issue which relates to all the other matters that have been mentioned.  The huge task we all face is to turn all of our many achievements to date into jobs.  It is for that reason I am so impressed by the priorities that have been set.

I am pleased the agenda covers the multi-annual financial framework, the preparation for the Council meeting in October and the European semester.  It is important for the Common Agricultural Policy to be retained in the manner that will best benefit the European food producing sector.  I use that term advisedly because we have common interests in that area.  It is of great importance for the European Union to recognise the ability of the EU area to produce food competitively and without any restrictions or impediments.  I reiterate that we need to try to ensure we retain the Common Agricultural Policy.  We should also ensure that any subsequent discussions at WTO level do not undermine any CAP agreement that may have been reached, to the detriment of Europe and this country.<\/p><p>  I would like to make a quick point about President Van Rompuy's proposals for an integrated financial framework, greater economic policy co-ordination, more fiscal and budgetary integration and democratic accountability and legitimacy.  When it was agreed many years ago to allow freedom of movement of people, goods, money and services across the European Union, it automatically followed that this kind of framework had to be introduced.  In the absence of such a framework, there would be a substantial discrepancy between the development potential of various areas.  At last, we are seeing the first signs of a co-ordinated approach at European level to the issues that have faced us and have been evident for several years now.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste, his negotiating team and all involved, including President Van Rompuy, on their efforts to date.<\/p><p>  The Chairman will be glad to know this is my last point.  The semester is very important.  I was one of those who were very critical of the failure to put in place a mechanism whereby the progress being made could be monitored on an ongoing basis.  We should not have to wait five or ten years before there is an examination of what happened or what failed to happen in previous years.  I hope matters will proceed in that fashion to our satisfaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900004#C00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1348074600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I will try to be as brief as possible as I know the T&aacute;naiste's time is valuable.  As Deputy Durkan said, the T&aacute;naiste mentioned in his speech that President Van Rompuy is pursuing the banking union project with real urgency.  We have always said there is a serious need for decent regulation of the banking sector.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think the proposals made by President Barroso in his state of the Union address last week will be sufficient and will include enough democratic accountability?  Is it possible the Government will support banking union but not political union?<\/p><p>  I would like to refer to four of the proposals.  It has been suggested there should be a single book of rules to govern the eurozone banks, that the European Central Bank should have the power to monitor all eurozone banks and have oversight in the wider EU, that a resolution regime should be established to enable troubled banks to be closed, and that there should be a fully fledged scheme to protect citizens' deposits across the eurozone.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe any of these four proposals should be a cause for concern for the Irish people and for the Government?  In that context, how does he envisage the next period will evolve in terms of any treaty changes that might be deemed necessary?<\/p><p>  As part of the June agreement, a bank deal was supposed to be agreed next month.  Chancellor Merkel's comment that no change is envisaged in respect of bank debt relief for Ireland was quoted on the floor of the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Can the T&aacute;naiste comment on that?  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il: \"The important point is that the conclusion must involve the right and best deal for Ireland's economy and people.\"  What would be an acceptable deal for Ireland, in the T&aacute;naiste's opinion?  Chancellor Merkel has said there will be no change in respect of bank debt relief.  If an interest rate of 2.5% is charged over 40 years, we will pay &euro;1 billion.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think that is acceptable?<\/p><p>  In June, the European Parliament adopted a resolution relating to so-called own resources.  The proposals to introduce a financial transactions tax and an EU VAT rate would allow the Union to increase its own resources.  Can the T&aacute;naiste reiterate Ireland's position on the possibility of a financial transactions tax being introduced?  What is the Government's position on own resources and future funding?

I would like to reiterate what some of my colleagues have said about the Common Agricultural Policy.  The T&aacute;naiste is aware it is very important for Ireland.  I wonder what views other member states have at the moment.  I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has had a number of meetings as part of the ongoing negotiations.  Obviously, it is very important.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about confidence.  He welcomed the German Constitutional Court's decision on the European Stability Mechanism, which was a positive development.  There is a feeling that every time European leaders come up with a solution, it leads to market confidence for a number of days - perhaps a week - before it falls away.  Are European leaders exasperated by such developments?<\/p><p>  A number of things were introduced in the final report of the Future of Europe group, which was produced on Monday of this week.  The group involved foreign ministers from ten European countries, including Germany, Spain and Portugal.  I am not sure about some of the ideas that were set out.  Obviously, there is nothing binding in this report.  It is just a view.  It is not even a unanimous view.  The report referred to matters like the long-term vision of Europe, majority decisions in the Common Foreign and Security Policy sphere, joint representation on international organisations, a European defence policy, a European army, senior and junior Commissioners and the election of a top European candidate as a sort of president of Europe.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that reports of this nature play into the hands of eurosceptics, especially in Britain, and are unhelpful at this time in terms of trying to get out of where we are?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900004#C00500","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1348074600,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy O'Reilly that the priority and the focus in Europe now needs to be on jobs and growth.  As he said, there has been, quite rightly, a strong emphasis on budgetary discipline over recent times.  Obviously, that will remain.  We all have to recognise that if the European economy is to recover, there has to be economic growth.  In particular, there has to be employment.  The challenge of youth unemployment, especially, needs to be addressed.  That is clear across Europe and in this country.  That is why a compact for jobs and growth was agreed at the June Council meeting.  That is why the European Council meeting in October will resume the discussion on how the compact for jobs and growth is to be implemented and driven forward.  I expect and hope that the European Council will give some specific directions in that regard.  The agreement that was reached in June represents an important reinforcement of political commitment in this area.  The approach in the compact is threefold.  First, its sets out the actions to be taken at member state level.  Second, it sets out the contribution of European policies to growth.  Third, it sets out the approach with regard to EMU related growth factors.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Reilly also asked about the issue of flexibility with regard to Common Agricultural Policy payments.<\/p> <p>Again, this does not pose any particular difficulty for Ireland.  We are in favour of allowing member states the flexibility to transfer funds between the two pillars according to their needs and priorities.  We also support the suggestion to exempt from co-funding funds that are transferred from pillar 1 to pillar 2.<\/p><p> Deputies Joe O'Reilly, Bernard Durkan and Se&aacute;n Kyne referred to the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of the multi-annual financial framework.  We need to consider the current position as regards the multi-annual financial framework because a number of issues remain to be resolved.  There is the question of what will be the ultimate size of the European budget up to 2020.  As everyone is aware, there are differing views among member states as to what should be the size of this budget because this will have a major influence on the ultimate size of the Common Agricultural Policy budget.  Ireland's position is that we support the proposals that were brought forward by the European Commission.  The European budget must be fit for purpose and, in particular, capable of delivering the measures needed to promote growth and jobs.  In that context, the Common Agricultural Policy is important for this country in respect of food security and the major contribution the agrifood sector makes to employment.  We are very pleased with the extent to which the sector has grown and is contributing to economic growth and recovery.<\/p><p> When member states are considering the European budget, it is important that they do not approach the issue with a view to identifying how much can be pared from this or that area but in terms of what the European budget can contribute to stimulating economic recovery in the member states, whether in the area of cohesion, research and innovation, education and training or the Common Agricultural Policy.  The continuation of a dynamic, consumer-focused agricultural production base in Europe is one of the areas where the European Union can add value.<\/p><p> Senator Reilly raised a number of issues.  It is important that we first recognise that this is a process which is following on from key decisions made in June.  In that context, I refer to Deputy Kyne's comment regarding a pattern of decisions being made at European level which brings confidence for a few days before such confidence slips back again.  That is a fair description of the action taken in response to the crisis in the 12 to 18 months prior to the June meeting.  The June meeting was different, however, because we have seen a retention of confidence in the markets since that meeting, as reflected in bond yields.  Everyone knows the figures in respect of the yields.  This retention of confidence is dependent in turn on the implementation of the measures that were agreed in June.  There cannot be any backsliding.  A critical element of the decision taken in June related to the compact on jobs and growth.  The compact must be driven forward and it is one of the issues I expect we will discuss on Monday and subsequently at the European Council meeting in October.  <\/p><p> To respond directly to Senator Reilly's question on the bank deal, it was agreed in June that bank debt would be separated from sovereign debt.  The conclusions of the June meeting made specific reference to addressing the Irish position and the Government has been following through on that matter.  There is not a day that engagement does not take place either at official or ministerial level, whether this involves the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, me or the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, engaging with our counterparts in other member states and the European institutions about working the deal through at a practical level.  We did this also in respect of the interest rate issue and leading up to the June summit when we secured agreement on the issue.  We will conduct discussions with our partners in private and confidentially.  We are confident of securing an outcome that will be to the best benefit of Irish people and taxpayers.  <\/p><p> We need to be careful when listening to or reading comments made by other Heads of State, whether Chancellor Merkel or anybody else, that we do not parse them too literally.  I interpret Chancellor Merkel's statement that there has been no change in respect of the bank deal for Ireland as meaning there has been no change from the decision that was made in June.  What we have to do is to work through that decision and seek agreement on it. <\/p><p> On the issue of own resources raised by Senator Reilly, the Commission has proposed new ways of funding the European Union, including through an EU VAT measure and a financial transactions tax.  The view of the Government has been that direct payments from member states as opposed to new lines of tax are the fairest and most effective way to proceed.  As the Senator is aware, concern has been expressed about the effect of a financial transactions tax on our financial sector if it were not applied globally or at least across all 27 member states.  <\/p><p> On the Future of Europe group, this is a very informal group of foreign ministers who, in the course of frequent meetings, are placing in the public domain some collective thoughts for consideration.  These ideas do not constitute a formal proposal.  The political cycle across the member states is such that when I counted those around the table at the most recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, I discovered I was in the top half of those present in terms of longevity.  Given that I have only been attending Council meetings for 18 months, members will have some idea of the cyclical nature of these matters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900004#C00600","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348075200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Long may the T&aacute;naiste continue to attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900005#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1348075200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and his officials and thank him for his clear and concise presentation.  Most of the questions I had in mind have been well aired and addressed.  Among other issues I wished to raise were the continued support for the Common Agricultural Policy and the continued focus on jobs and growth.  While the latter appears to form part of all Presidencies and is widely discussed, sadly there has been great difficulty in implementing pan-European policies that would support such an approach.<\/p><p>  Much of our current problems, as the T&aacute;naiste is aware, are tied up with the lack of credit supply.  While certain measures have been taken to resolve problems in the banking sector, there remains, I regret, considerable credit tightness which is causing major difficulty for small and medium enterprises and the domestic market.  Similar problems pertain in a number of other countries and, as the T&aacute;naiste noted, part of our recovery platform rests on our ability to trade into these other member state economies.  Our efforts are being hampered by the necessity to address our debt and, in particular, deficit problem.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste indicated that the overall size of the European Union budget is a key issue and one of the most difficult issues being addressed.  Should member states engage in greater economic integration?  Must we grapple with this issue once and for all and decide what we want do with the European budget?  If we are to support jobs and growth on a Europe-wide basis, do we not need a much larger budget?<\/p> <p>That is not necessarily an easy one from the point of view of other countries because they see themselves as the paymasters.  We have seen that in regard to issues such as eurobonds and various other mechanisms that might be utilised.  Is there a time when a small country can start to put forward a contrarian viewpoint?  One could argue that there is never a good time for that because we are dependent to a large extent or because we negotiate well.  However, from contacts I have had with parliamentarians from some of the smaller - some would say peripheral - countries, there is a desire to see a much greater focus and emphasis on them.  The T&aacute;naiste might not get his way before Ireland takes over the Presidency.  Indeed, he might not get his way until he is the one sitting at that table the longest and that can happen, which brings its own challenges.  We need to set the agenda.  Ireland is very good at bringing together other countries with similar desires and needs.  I have great faith in the T&aacute;naiste's skills and capacity and believe it is time for Ireland to state clearly what we think the European budget should be about and the values and policies we think should flow from it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900005#D00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348075800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming in to brief us this evening.  I wish to ask him about the situation in Syria.  We are all, rightly and justifiably, fixated with the challenges that we are facing in Ireland and across Europe but the level of human carnage in that country has escalated severely over the summer, which poses enormous challenges for the entire region.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the role of the European Union in response to the escalation of violence in Syria.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to our theme for the Presidency and our stance on the millennium development goals.  I had the opportunity to visit Malawi with Tr&oacute;caire over the summer which put a human face on the challenges facing that country and the wider region and on the work Ireland and Europe is doing there.  We have set the objective of updating the millennium development goals, given that they expire in 2015.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke of the need for a more holistic approach to understanding what causes poverty and hunger and I ask him to outline the progress being made in that regard.<\/p><p>  Discussions are taking place at the moment regarding President Van Rompuy's themes and the T&aacute;naiste referred to the bilateral talks that Ireland is currently engaged in.  In that context, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to give some consideration to the role of the Parliament in all of this.  For all of the criticism of unelected Eurocrats, we must acknowledge that President Von Rompuy has argued that we must address the issue of democratic legitimacy.  That is not just an issue for Governments but also for Parliaments.  I would welcome the T&aacute;naiste's views on how the Oireachtas could be included in that at some point in the future.<\/p><p>  On the issue of bank recapitalisation and the challenges we face in that regard, I find the exercise that is now taking place, with people trying to frame what may or may not come out of the current negotiations, intriguing.  First, people argued that those negotiations would never happen but now they are happening.  People are now saying, depending on the outcome of the negotiations, these are the criteria by which we will judge if they are successful.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that we would not be able to engage with the issue of how our banks might be recapitalised in a way that does not affect the Irish taxpayer without accessing the ESM, which was contingent on us passing the European Stability Mechanism treaty.   Had we not passed that treaty and were not able to access that fund, our prospects of delivering any kind of progress in this area would be negligible.  Given the comments made during the campaign in that regard, how helpful is the T&aacute;naiste finding the passage of that treaty in the negotiations that are now taking place?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900006#E00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1348075800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an T&aacute;naiste.  I find some of the language used by the T&aacute;naiste in his speech today a little difficult to understand and I do not pretend to know the ins and outs of everything.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste made reference to the retention of confidence, which centred around the measures agreed in June.  Over the summer there was much positivity regarding our meeting of Troika targets, the NTMA bond auctions and so forth.  While it is good that we have met those targets, what is more important is the Compact for Growth and Jobs.  Many people are asking how the meeting of targets is impacting on their daily lives.  There is a social cost involved, with the disabled and pensioners badly affected and people losing their jobs across Europe.  Is it worth it?  That is the big question.  It is the confidence of ordinary people that I would be more interested in winning, rather than that of those who feature in the financial pages of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>  or other newspapers.  While market confidence is important, the confidence of the general population is more so and in that context, the Compact for Growth and Jobs and the stimulus package the T&aacute;naiste referred to are crucial.  When will we see the benefits of those coming through?  That is the main question on people's minds.  They want to know when we will see light at the end of the tunnel.  If the price of meeting the troika targets is the dismantling of social supports right across Europe, then it is not worth it.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about lunches, side-meetings and so forth but the crisis is not just in Ireland, it is Europe-wide.  <\/p><p>   I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade a few hours ago, which was addressed by a group from Palestine.  They spoke about the situation on the ground, where people are being forced off their land, the water supply is contaminated and so forth.  The T&aacute;naiste made a statement to the effect that if the situation there deteriorates further, we may consider imposing a boycott on settler-made goods.  Committee members wondered today if things could get much worse.  When we take over the Presidency next year, perhaps we could take that line.  People want to see action on this issue, not just in Ireland but across Europe.  The conflict in Palestine seems to have moved off the agenda because of the Arab Spring and what is happening in Syria but what is happening there amounts to ethnic cleansing.  People are being forced off their land, in some cases at gunpoint.  All sorts of excuses are being used in an attempt to justify it.  The T&aacute;naiste is well aware of the situation and the Irish Government has been very positive with regard to Palestine.  <\/p><p>  The Palestinian representatives spoke about the money that has come from the European Union for infrastructure projects, which amounted to &euro;50 million over the last few years.  Approximately &euro;30 millionworth of that infrastructure has been destroyed, with the demolition of schools, other buildings and so on.   Indeed, it appears that there is a deliberate targeting of EU-funded infrastructure.  Perhaps it is time for Europe to step up to the plate and do something about the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900006#E00300","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1348076400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I echo the words of welcome to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his team to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.

The problem with rocking a boat is that it makes one seasick.  I prefer to think in terms of helping to steer the boat.  That is the space we are in.  At an organisational level, when we take on the Presidency of the European Union at the beginning of next year we will be in that position.  We have done much preparation for the Presidency.  The Taoiseach and I, with about ten other Ministers, will be meeting the EU Commission on 3 and 4 October to have a full discussion about the Presidency and our objectives during that period.  There will be visits to Ireland by Commissioners and by senior figures from EU institutions and the committees of the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  With regard to whether we should seek a larger budget, we must take a realistic approach to the EU budget.  Most member states, including ourselves, are making budgetary adjustments.  It is understandable that member states, particularly those who are big contributors to the EU budget, would say that if they are making big adjustments to their own budgets the European Union should, perhaps, adjust its budget also.  That is the debate that is taking place.  We can argue that all member states are interdependent and that the economic recovery of individual member states is entirely bound up with the recovery of the European Union.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe made a fair criticism.  We often talk about European Union issues in a unique eurospeak language, much of which is institutional and technical.  We must be clear about what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to achieve employment, good economic conditions and a good standard of living for people.  We also want to set a threshold of decency below which we will not go.  Some people describe this as the social Europe idea.  It means the maintenance of good working conditions and good environmental standards.  <\/p><p>  To do all of that we must pay our way.  The difficulty with meeting targets is that the targets are not arbitrary.  The one thing we learned during the boom years is that we cannot, or should not, spend what we do not have.  If one tries to spend what one does not have one gets into a huge amount of trouble, as we have found out to our cost.  If the country is borrowing three euro of every ten we spend, there is no point in saying we do not want to meet the targets.  We cannot go on fooling ourselves forever.  We do have to meet the targets, not to please someone else but because it is the sensible thing to do.  We must make our finances sustainable and pay our way in the world.  That is bound up with what we want to do with regard to the European budget. <\/p><p>  This brings me back to Deputy Dooley's question.  We must support the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth while reflecting current budgetary consolidation imperatives in member states.  Ireland seeks to ensure that adequate funding is available for investment in economic growth and the creation of employment, and that countries in our situation, especially in relation to unemployment, can access all EU growth enhancement programmes.  Ireland is, therefore, strongly supporting the Cypriot Presidency in its efforts to finalise agreement on the European budget by the end of 2012.<\/p><p>  Deputy Paschal Donohoe raised a number of questions, some of which were also referred to by Deputies Crowe and Keaveney.  The situation in Syria is appalling.  At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Cyprus the weekend before last we received an update on the situation in Syria.  The degree to which Syrian people are being killed is truly shocking.  There have been repeated attempts to make progress.  We saw the attempts by Kofi Annan and the United Nations, and there have been more recent efforts.  The inability of the UN Security Council to agree on a robust resolution, particularly because of the positions of Russia and China, is an issue.  The European Union has imposed sanctions on the Syrian regime.  We discussed those in Cyprus and we will be returning to that discussion.  I will be attending the UN General Assembly.  During that week, I will meet the UN Secretary General and the crisis in Syria will be among the issues we will discuss.  Ireland, and the European Union, are taking an active role.  At EU level, we will shortly have a meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister.  I hope to have an opportunity to meet him when I am in New York at the General Assembly and to discuss Syria with him. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900007#F00200","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1348076400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the meeting.

It is important to take stock of how far we have come in this regard.  When the Government came into office 18 months ago, shortly after the agreement of the EU-IMF-ECB programme, the State was unable to borrow money from any private source.  That is the position in which we found ourselves.  It is vital that we meet the troika targets in order to continue borrowing the money we need to run the country.  We are in an exceptional set of circumstances where, regrettably, we were obliged to approach the lender of last resort, namely, the troika at the end of 2010.  When a bank manager sets out the conditions of a loan, the borrower is obliged to meet them or the loan instalments will cease.  That is the exceptional scenario in which we are operating.<\/p><p>  The immediate reward for meeting the targets set by the troika is that we continue to receive the loan money we require.  Our success in meeting those targets - in fact, we are ahead of target in some areas - means we will be able to exit the programme on time and recover our economic sovereignty.  Our achievement in this regard has restored confidence in this country among international investors.  That can be seen in our continuing strong performance in the area of foreign direct investment, with several major jobs announcements since the beginning of the year.  As a consequence of some of those investment announcements, we are now beginning to see resumed activity in a range of sectors, including construction.  These investment decisions are translating in immediate terms into construction jobs.<\/p><p>  We have attained several important objectives in regard to the implementation of the troika programme.  We successfully secured a reduction in the interest rate, for example, and achieved a flexibility in the programme which allowed the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to announce a stimulus programme during the summer which allowed for the construction of additional schools, primary care centres and so all.  All of this will translate into jobs.  While there is no immediate solution to the problem of our bank debt, we have had several notable successes in securing a deal more favourable to us.  We have, for example, obtained an agreement on the separation of sovereign and bank debt.  We secured a specific commitment at the June Council meeting that a dedicated arrangement for Ireland would be agreed.  In fact, the conclusions of that meeting included a specific reference to Ireland's success in meeting its commitments under the programme.<\/p><p>  This is where the issue of European solidarity is hugely important.  The bottom line is that there is a strong desire throughout Europe to see Ireland succeed.  Europe needs a success story and this country is probably the best candidate for that honour.  Ireland's successful emergence from its programme will, in turn, facilitate a broader European recovery and restore confidence in the European project.  Without wishing to oversell or overstate the case - such matters are not resolved overnight - this will translate, over time, into investment, job creation, improved living standards and ultimately an improved financial situation which will enable us to take the type of action that is not currently possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012091900008#G00100","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1348077000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the T&aacute;naiste for joining us and for answering members' questions so thoroughly.

I note what the Chairman said and we will attempt to be as brief as possible.  In reality, we have a narrow range of issues we wish to put to the joint committee, which will reflect our concerns that in some respects the draft legislation under consideration does not fully or in some cases, appropriately, reflect the position as set out in the Commission on Credit Unions.  If I may, I will launch straight into it.<\/p><p>  The first issue for us pertains to democratic control within credit unions.  Credit union thinking, planning and operations worldwide are based on ten fundamental credit union operating principles that provide a common foundation among all credit unions.  The second operating principle - namely, democratic control - provides a number of considerations, including members enjoying equal rights, credit unions being autonomous within the framework of law and regulation and recognition that credit unions are co-operative enterprises controlled by the members.  Credit union elected officers are voluntary in nature and the incumbents should not receive a salary for fulfilling the duties for which they were elected.  However, credit unions may reimburse legitimate expenses incurred by elected officials.  In light of this, we ask that in revisiting this draft general scheme, full consideration be given to the significant concern that provisions of the draft general scheme unduly interfere with this operating principle.  Our point is that in seeking to impose, for example, term limits - restrictions on the amount of time persons can spend on credit union boards - and in the list of prohibitions which specifies the people who may not serve on boards, the democratic principle is being interfered with.  Credit unions will not be allowed to elect whomsoever they wish to serve on their boards.  In addition, it would be inequitable, unnecessary and potentially detrimental to some, particularly small, credit unions to impose a legal restriction on the number of years an individual can serve as a director or on the board oversight committee.  Were this proposal to be implemented, the Republic of Ireland movement would be the only credit union movement worldwide where such a limitation would exist.  What is the justification for this unfavourable treatment of Irish credit unions, as against all other credit union movements worldwide?  Our colleague, the vice-president of the World Council of Credit Unions, is present and I will ask him to say a brief word on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900003#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1348061400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Perhaps the witnesses could be introduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900003#G00400","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1348061400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Although I indicated their names at the outset, Mr. Brennan can introduce them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900003#G00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348061400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I am the chief executive officer of the Irish League of Credit Unions.

Frankly, this raises some safety and soundness concerns, since the role of the board is to control the credit union and manage risk.  If one is just a man off the street, one does not know much about the operations of a financial institution and the way one learns about it is through experience or education.  While some credit union directors may not have acquired that sort of background, there are very many who have and without a lot of experience and education one would not be able to understand the true financial position of the credit union or otherwise manage risk.  In addition, our model law for credit unions contains an interpretive note I think may have been misconstrued by some people.  It states, not in the statutory text but in the commentary, that some credit unions have decided to go with term limits and that if term limits are desired, they should be specified in the by-laws.  Some people have read the final sentence of that note out of context, as stating it should be mandatory.  This was not the intent when we revised it in 2011 or in 2008.  Had it been, it would have been in the statutory text itself and not in the interpretive notes.  If one is to have term limits, they must be written down someplace, and that would be in the by-laws, but in our view, it would not be a mandatory thing.  In fact, that would be detrimental.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900003#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Edwards"},{"type":"speech","time":1348061400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We will come back to this point during the questions.  Mr. Brennan may proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900003#G00800","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348061400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Our point simply is that were we to proceed with that proposition, Irish credit unions would be out on a limb and virtually the only movement to which such a restriction would apply.  One may observe the fact that no other financial institution in the Republic of Ireland is subject to this type of restriction and we consider this to be highly objectionable, particularly in light of recent events in the wider financial services industry in the country.  I again ask: what is the justification for this unfavourable treatment of credit unions relative to other financial service providers in the Republic of Ireland?  We ask that in preference to providing such hard restrictions in primary legislation, credit unions be invited to amend their own registered rules to insert a provision regarding term limits for the board of directors, board oversight committee and principal officers, where such a proposal is considered to be workable in the circumstances of the particular credit union and the pool of volunteers available to it and where it is in the best interests of the members of that credit union.<\/p><p>  Another issue for us is that of prohibitions, as outlined in head 20, subhead 10, on membership of the board or the board oversight committee of a credit union.<\/p> <p>We have serious questions about the legality and constitutionality of these exclusions, which are seen as representing an undue interference with democracy and the constitutional rights of individuals.  The extensive list of prohibitions set out on people in that head of the Bill undermines the democratic principle in credit unions and goes on to interfere with the constitutional rights of the individuals prohibited.  While understanding the necessity to implement some such prohibitions, these recommendations go so far as to almost ensure a negative impact on credit unions.  We ask that further and full consideration be given to matter and if in the event the decision is made to proceed, the attention of the Attorney General's office is drawn to these concerns of unconstitutionality at an early stage.<\/p><p> A third issue we are concerned about is the proposal to regulate credit unions in accordance with tiering by reference to asset size only.  The league board position on this is that it does not support the creation or classes, types or tiers of credit unions on the basis of asset size alone and believes a model based on risk and complexity of the business model would be more appropriate.  To be clear, we are saying we support the principle that there should be differentiated regulation within credit unions.  One size does not fit all.  Very large and very small credit unions must be treated differently, but that cannot be done on the basis of asset size alone.  The complexity of the business model must be examined and regulation applied according to the risk profile.  We ask that the model already successfully operated by the Financial Services Authority, FSA, in Britain and, more recently, in Northern Ireland, including in the league's 104 credit unions based there, whereby credit unions are categorised into different versions on the basis of risk and complexity of business model, be adopted in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p> Credit union members tell us they would take issue with the proposal to remove the office of treasurer.  While we fully accept the definition in law of treasurer in the 1997 Credit Union Act as managing director is incorrect and inappropriate and that a number of the current statutory functions are purely operational issues that should properly be conducted by the executive, the league board does not believe the office should be abolished in its entirety.  The 1997 Act sets out the role of treasurer as a member of the board responsible for governance at a strategic and policy level but also assigns a number of operational functions to that person.  The commission put forward the proposition that the governance and strategic spheres should be totally separated from the operational and executive spheres.  We agree with that but there is no need to abolish the office completely.  It could be restricted to the operational level.  Why can credit unions not have a treasurer in the same way as the local football or GAA team?  We ask that the office of treasurer be retained in law for the purpose of ensuring the timely preparation of accounts and their onward presentation to the general meeting.<\/p><p> The last of our major issues relates to the memorandum of understanding between credit unions and the Central Bank of Ireland.  At a time when credit unions are moving to a new and markedly different regulatory environment, it is critical that a memorandum of understanding be agreed by the credit unions and the Central Bank.  The document should address how each party will interact with the other and how communications will be conducted, specifically when written instructions and confirmations will be required of either party.  There are substantial regulatory and other changes proposed for credit unions and it is important the regulated and the regulator agree a way to communicate around those changes.  The last thing we need is difficulty arising from any misunderstanding.  We ask the committee to support our proposal for the putting in place of a memorandum of understanding.<\/p><p> There were some issues in the Commission on Credit Unions' final report that were discussed and remarked upon but were not made the subject of specific recommendations.  We would like to draw the committee's attention to them.<\/p><p> There is an enabling provision in Part 2 in the governance section of the Bill.  We have commented on tiering arrangements, whereby credit unions of different sizes and complexity would and should be regulated differently.  The power to vary that specifically has not been given in the legislation.  The Central Bank has not been given the power to vary its regulatory behaviour for the different types of credit union and we contend that power must be explicitly stated in the legislation.<\/p><p> Alternative and additional means of raising capital should be explored.  Provision should be made for alternative additional means by which credit unions could raise capital.  This is of importance in an era when credit union income continues to fall.  Successful methods being used in other movements include issuing deferred shares, member paid-in capital and non-member paid-in capital.  The opportunity should not be lost to provide in law for a credit union liquidity mechanism which would be triggered at a future date in the event such a need were to arise.  The commission report correctly states the liquidity position in credit unions as being very strong.  If we go back two or three years, however, that would not have been the case and there would have been extensive debate around the need for a mechanism.  We are saying that should be looked at and such a mechanism should be put in place for a time when the need might arise.<\/p><p> We are also concerned about the omission of electronically enabled payment accounts when the report's recommendations were being transposed into legislation.  Credit unions should be leaders in assisting Government to implement its financial inclusion agenda.  The new Bill should encourage credit unions by permitting them to offer electronically enabled payment accounts.  We are asking credit unions to step up to the plate and engage in change and improve the member service offering, but we are not enabling them to take on the technological know-how to do that.  We are saying to enable that, at least, in the legislation.<\/p><p> Social finance is a very important issue for credit unions.  It is an issue the commission report spent considerable time discussing but on which it did not make any recommendation that found its way into the legislation.  The suggestion is simple and appropriate for current times: the Bill should amend the 1997 Act in order that credit unions can lend to Government-backed schemes or projects that have a social benefit.  We all agree that is a desirable outcome at present.<\/p><p> The Bill does not reflect the position and thrust of the report where it asks credit unions to engage fully in the restructuring agenda.  It asks credit unions to come together and provide enhanced services but it does not enable them to do so.  The Bill should support the establishment of credit union service organisations and other means of sharing services between credit unions.  If we want them to come together and behave in a better aggregated way, they must be enabled to do that in legislation.<\/p><p> Given all of the provisions and new requirements of credit unions and the new compliance requirements that have been put forward, a legislative provision around a regulatory impact analysis should be conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland as part of its system of regulation of credit unions.  This is both desirable and necessary.  Where such huge change takes place in the future, the Central Bank should be mandated in legislation to undertake a regulatory impact analysis and discover precisely what the impact of the changes will be.  That should properly inform the debate around future regulatory changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900003#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348062000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan.

One has to do with governance issues and the other with what we would see as omissions of matters which in some cases appear in the report but are not necessarily reflected in the legislation.  We are focused, on the one hand, on inappropriate reflection of the commission's report and, on the other, omissions.  We have come here today to state that credit unions are stepping up to the plate, that there is a significant change and restructuring agenda and that we need to make it work, but credit unions need to be appropriately equipped and enabled to do this.  For example, term limits and prohibitions would run contrary to a number of objectives set out in the commission's report.  In a number of instances the commission has made a number of points along the lines, for example, that the volunteer principle should be protected and promoted, but when one looks at a number of the issues in detail, they are undermined to some extent.  Most of the individual items could be argued for to make sense on their own, but when one looks at them in the aggregate, particularly for the smaller credit unions, they undermine the voluntary ethos of credit unions.  In terms of the omissions, I do not wish in any way to cast aspersions on the good work done by the commission and the contents of its report, but there was considerable pressure to operate within a given timeframe.<\/p><p>  On tiering, those of us involved in the league have considerable experience of the arrangements in the United Kingdom.  We have responsibility for representing the majority of credit unions in Northern Ireland which earlier this year were made subject to the same regime which has been operated in Britain for quite a few years.  There is a two-tier arrangement in Britain where there are version 1 and version 2 credit unions.  The way that it operates is that a credit union makes a decision on the type of services and their level of sophistication and the level of risk it wishes to carry.  For example, it could state it wants to be a simple credit union providing only for savings and loans and, therefore, in the lower tier of regulation, or it could wish to be a more sophisticated one providing the complete range of personal financial services for its members, in which case it will need to be in the higher level of regulation.  We say do it on that basis, but that relationship between risk, sophistication of offering, products and regulation is missed in this proposal which is simply based on asset size alone.  One could, for example, have some large credit unions offering limited services and, likewise, some modest ones offering quite complex products.  There needs to be a reconfiguration of the tiering arrangements to reflect risk and product offerings in credit unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900006#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1348063200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>How would the prohibitions on serving at board level affect the movement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900006#K00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348063200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>This is one of the issues we have had all along, throughout the commission process and subsequent to it.

Sinn F&eacute;in supports the strengthening of credit union regulation but we need to see strong regulation that suits both members and the credit unions themselves.  An understanding of the distinctive character of credit unions and the unique role that its members have played needs to be at the core of our deliberations.  This Bill misses that understanding.  If we ignored the democratic nature of the credit union movement across the island of Ireland, that directors are elected at AGMs and that small credit unions completely rely on volunteers, we would agree with the provisions of the Bill.  We might support term limits if we were dealing with the directors of the big banks which take large sums of money from our pockets because we own them, but these are volunteers.  That is what is missing from the Bill.<\/p><p>  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on term limits and the impact they would have on credit unions, particularly in respect of their democratic nature.  There is an impression that directors could sit in a small credit union for the rest of their lives because it is a nice number but is that the real experience for directors and what do AGMs mean?  Section 10 is insulting to people who have offered up their time and efforts and who in many instances have established the credit union movement in their communities.  It may have been a couple of families who believed in social solidarity and a not-for-profit movement rather than allow bankers and major financial institutions to reap the benefit of people's hard earned cash.  However, it is next to impossible to sustain the level of competence required under the Bill.  Sections 12 and 13 set out the competences that a director is required to have.  The Bill states that one must have competences across the board, including personal qualities, skills, experience, expertise, competence, capabilities, professionalism and probity, along with meeting certain qualifications, backgrounds and legal requirements.  However, God forbid, if a director's son painted the local credit union because he or she would have to resign.  If a director's wife worked voluntarily as a teller, he would have to resign.  If his mother or father was involved on a voluntary basis he would also have to resign.  This does not make sense.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the real impact that will have on the movement.<\/p><p>  The memorandum of understanding was mentioned earlier.  What do the witnesses envisage the memorandum containing and how could it ensure a good relationship between credit unions and the regulator in the Central Bank?<\/p><p>  I have spoken to representatives of local credit unions and I am sure other Members are also being lobbied by credit unions across the State.  Many of them are concerned about the new regulations and the associated costs and levies.  The witnesses indicated that they would like the Central Bank to carry out a regulatory impact assessment, which is sensible.  What would that look like and why is it important, particularly for smaller rural credit unions?<\/p><p>  One the key aspects the Commission on Credit Unions addressed was the future development of the sector.  This is missing from the Bill, however.  While it is important to develop strong regulation that protects members, credit unions and the public, it is also important that we consider the vision for the credit union movement into the future.  The witnesses referred to proposals such as electronic transfers and shared services but where do they think credit unions should go and what should we have in this legislation to allow the movement to flourish and mature in a responsible way?<\/p><p>  In regard to the risk assessment, it was suggested that we consider the model used in the North, where there are 104 credit union branches.  I agree with that idea.  Anybody who investigated the banking collapse in Ireland and the risky lending that went on in Anglo Irish Bank will accept the need to consider risks instead of assets.  It does not make sense to allow a risky credit union to lend risky products to consumers when a non-risky credit union with the same asset base is regulated in the same way.  Why was the work of the FSA in the North and Britain not investigated?  Why has the Bill gone down the road of looking at assets?<\/p><p>  My final question is not related to the Bill but I am hearing complaints about the lending restrictions that the regulator has placed on a number of credit unions.  I have been contacted by individuals who are frustrated because they cannot get money from credit unions solely because of these restrictions.  I understand these restrictions could also jeopardise a number of credit unions in the medium term if they remain in place.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on what they think should be done in this regard.<\/p><p>  The credit union movement is testimony to what is good in this country and it is a pity that the remainder of our financial institutions did not behave as responsibly.  Even the suggestion of amending the previous Act to allow investments in social solidarity projects is commendable and worthy of our consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900007#L00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348063800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague, Ms Fiona Cullen, to address most of Deputy Doherty's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900007#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348064400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Doherty for his questions.  There is an argument for the term limits.  There are dangers relating to entrenched leadership, but there needs to be a level of respect for the fact that some people have given decades of service to the credit union movement.  It would be very na&iuml;ve of any of us to think that will go away all of a sudden because we write something into statute or that that will be accepted by people who might have given 30 years of service to their credit union.<\/p><p>  We do not accept the premise that there is no renewal in the boards of credit unions.  At the moment credit union directors are elected at the AGM by their fellow members to carry out specific tasks under the Credit Union Act.  That said, their term of office cannot exceed three years and just like the members present, they need to produce the goods to get back into a position to get elected again.  There are people who have been returned again and again.  We must ask ourselves why that is.  Let us presume that in the majority of cases it is because people do a very good job.  It is very difficult to quantify the impact.  We have engaged in extensive consultation with the members of the league since the publication of the commission report.  At the various engagements we have had, including at our AGM and at roadshows around the country, we canvassed their views a number of times and we continually hear that this is entirely the wrong thing to do.<\/p><p>  The CEO and Mr. Edwards have spoken about the world experience.  Every credit union has a set of rules registered under the Credit Union Act.  We have a process whereby amendments to those rules come through the league AGM.  There is nothing wrong with a credit union in its own circumstances with a sufficient pool of volunteers open to it, deciding that it is the right thing for that credit union and we would support that all the way.  There is a difficulty with a statutory obligation to walk away after nine years.  There are questions as to whether somebody would serve for nine years, go away for six and come back.  That would be a loss to the credit union and the community.  We feel it would be a much better to allow them to write it into the registered rules if it is beneficial for that particular credit union and if a board of directors, who are best placed to make such a decision, so decide.<\/p><p>  Mr. Brennan and I participated in the commission and are very respectful work that was done.  We know better than anyone how hard everybody worked.  However, sitting in an office in the Department of Finance and coming up with wonderful plans may cause long-term damage to the credit union movement because at a particular time with particular external pressures there was a school of thought that it was the right thing to do.<\/p><p>  Our thinking on the memorandum of understanding is as follows.  There will always be tension between the regulator and the regulated - that is the way of the world.  We are trying to do whatever we can to mitigate that.  As far as we can see one of the things that would assist in that regard is if there was an agreement - obviously it does not create any legal obligation.  However, it would provide clarity on the roles of each.  There is an issue with the registry or the Central Bank needing written confirmations from the credit union as whether it has done something and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  If a credit union is being directed to do something by the Central Bank we would want to see clarity around the particular issues that should be dealt with by written direction.  For example, if a credit union is instructed not to hold its AGM for a period, there should be a formal written instruction from the regulator to the chairman of the board of the credit union.  That would help with the difficulties that will always be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900008#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1348064400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Cullen to confirm that she is not seeking to have the memorandum to be spelled out in the legislation.

It was the same with the RIAs.  Having discussed it at length the commission came to the view that to write a statutory obligation into the legislation for the Central Bank to have to conduct an RIA in every circumstance would not be correct for issues that took up a lot of time at the commission table.  So it was felt that legislation was not appropriate for that.  We are not suggesting that an MOU would feature in the legislation.  As a matter of good practice and as a sensible way forward when moving to something entirely different, we feel it is appropriate to set out clearly what is expected of each party.  We feel it would be of benefit in the long term.<\/p><p>  On the risk assessment issue, I will give some more information about the system in the UK.  It has operated a system of version 1 and version 2 credit unions for ten years.  Credit unions are taken to be version 1 credit unions, which is the smaller of the scale.  A credit union can apply to become a version 2 credit union and if successful it can enter into more activities and services than a version 1 institution can.  For example, in the area of investments version 1 credit unions may only invest for a term of 12 months, whereas version 2 credit unions can invest for five years.  In the area of lending, version 1 credit unions may only lend &pound;15,000 more than shareholding where version 2 institutions can lend the greater of &pound;15,000 or 1.5% of the total shares of the credit union which could be a significant figure depending on the level of shareholding.  On duration of loans, version 1 credit unions may lend for five years secured and ten years unsecured, whereas version 2 credit unions may lend for ten years secured and 25 years unsecured.  On credit unions borrowing for their own purposes, a version 1 credit union may borrow 20% of its overall shares whereas a version 2 credit union may borrow up to 50% of its shares.<\/p><p>  The biggest change between the two and probably the biggest regulatory consideration in deciding whether to admit a credit union to version 2 is the reserve requirement.  The capital to asset ratio requirement for a version 1 credit union is 3% - the reserve requirement for credit unions in the Republic of Ireland at the moment is 10%, but that is a different conversation.  A UK credit union moving from version 1 to version 2 moves from a 3% requirement to an 8% requirement.  Fundamental to the FSA's decision whether to allow a credit union into version 2 thereby allowing it to offer enhanced services is the requirement to see a detailed plan as to how the credit union will hit the 8% minimum requirement and how it will maintain it.  As part of the application process the FSA needs to see evidence of documented systems of control, organisational charts, details of experience, qualifications of key people within the credit union, a detailed business plan, full and up-to-date policies and procedures, and copies of liquidity management policy, lending policy and financial risk management policy.<\/p><p>  So there is a process of assessment and this may be where we differ.  If there is to be a tiered system of credit union regulation set by hard and fast asset-size boundaries, a credit union would be allotted into one of those tiers.  For example an excellent &euro;6 million credit union that is really restricted in what it can do would not get to be a tier 2 - the term used in the commission report - credit union without either substantially increasing its asset size of amalgamating with the credit union down the road.  That is the problem we are experiencing.  We are talking about a voluntary process of restructuring whereas in reality if a credit union wants to do anything other than the absolute basics, it is not voluntary at all.<\/p><p>  The key thing is that the credit union should think long and hard about whether it wants to enhance the service it provides to members and it has the choice to make the application to the FSA and illustrate to it that it will be able to cope with being a version 2 credit union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900008#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1348064400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>At the outset I wish to declare that I have been a member of the credit union movement since my first communion - that was where I was told to invest my money.

A credit union is a community-based institution and the foundation block is volunteerism.  I listened to Ms Cullen and Mr. Brennan talk about the British model.  I am member of the economic forum of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which examined the credit union movement in the UK and Ireland.  They seek to emulate what we have here.  They see it as the best example of what the credit union movement should be.  To that end, one must put people in the frame of mind that credit unions fill a gap in society that traditional financial institutions have not wanted to fill because it was not profit-making and was based on volunteerism.  Something should resonate with people.  Moneylenders are the last resort for most people and credit unions often fill the gap in a prudential, meaningful and community-based manner by lending people money when they need it.  They have an established relationship with those people.  Despite the fact that one is dealing with people whose financial circumstances are not phenomenal, the credit union movement in Ireland is in very good shape in comparison with other financial institutions.  Let us give that message loud and clear to the Central Bank and tell it that what it is looking for is over-the-top.  When one is looking at liquidity and risk management, one is getting it wrong.  The weighting attached to car loans and sending people to universities is not the same as the contracts for financing blocks of apartments and hotel resorts in Bulgaria.  The regulator needs to look at the socioeconomic and community side of this.  The legacy of the boyos in AIB and the rest is not what the credit union movement is involved in.<\/p><p>  Coincidentally, the issue of AIB branch closures throughout the country was raised in Topical Issues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  There have been over 50 closures.  I come from a rural constituency  and there will be an enormous area over north Kerry and west Limerick that will be without banking services.  There are credit unions in there and if the circumstances are such that if one restricts who can be involved in the running of credit unions, one will give away the lifeblood of that which has kept it there and brought it forward.  I get this in droves and I would like to help the credit union movement as much as possible.  Does the delegation have a model in respect of lending, the risk element and the weighting of money we can give to the Central Bank in order to make that stack up because I think this has become over-the-top?  As parliamentarians, we need to get behind and recognise the credit union movement because of all that is good in it and what it has achieved to date.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900009#N00100","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348065000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Deputy Spring raised a number of issues, some of them connected to what Deputy Pearse Doherty said about the vision for the future and I will put them to our president.

They really reinforce the need for a memorandum of understanding between the representative organisations - credit unions and the Central Bank.  We believe that is critical going forward.  Deputy Spring made a point about volunteerism, which is the distinction between credit unions and other financial institutions or people providing financial services.  Volunteerism is the edge we have.  Credit unions started off with just volunteers and no resources and, as Deputy Spring noted, have become very successful and admired throughout the world and Ireland for what they have done and what they continue to do.  Volunteerism is still the edge.  It comes back to the point made by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  Our concern about the prohibitions in the legislation is that anything that works against volunteerism will work against the credit union movement developing in the future.  At a time when the country needs to promote active citizenship and volunteerism, legislation should actively promote volunteerism.  It is not to take from the points Deputy Humphreys made about the need to regenerate boards to bring on new people and get new ideas.  That is a separate principle but allied to the principle of volunteerism and we believe the legislation should promote volunteerism and best practice in terms of governance.  It is critical for the credit union movement that we have volunteerism going forward.<\/p><p>  In terms of the vision, Mr. Brennan laid out in the last few points what we see as missing from the draft legislation.  It relates to key issues and the vision we have for the credit union movement, a vision members of the Irish League of Credit Unions have bought into.  We need the huge change menu within the draft legislation and we buy into it but we must do so in a way that gets us to some place where we can provide better services to our members.  <\/p><p>  Our mission is to ensure the change process in which we are actively engaged and working on will facilitate the delivery of a full range of personal financial services to our members in the near future.  We hope to see the creation of the required flexibility for various forms of co-operation among credit unions; that we will have the enablement and encouragement of various forms of co-operation; the preservation of the movement's social, volunteer and community ethos; the preservation of local identity and autonomy while enabling credit unions to be a part of greater movement co-operative alliances; and the facilitation of the creation of movement-owned infrastructure in information technology in payments and other appropriate areas which are required to achieve the above.  That is what we want the legislation to enable for the credit union movement, not just the legislative and regulatory requirements that are seen as necessary and the improvements in governance, which we accept, as well as those in training and education.  <\/p><p>  In respect of volunteerism, there will be a big step up in terms of the skills required to be on boards of credit unions in the future.  We want to be able to attract ordinary, normal people who are members of credit unions to be volunteers in and directors of their credit unions.  We want to be able to give them the training, education and skills.  They will bring their own life skills, which is critical going forward.  If there are prohibitions on volunteers and time limits, there will be massive investments in people that will not come to the desired fruition.

Credit unions need to be empowered to come together and share services for their members so that one can walk into a credit union in Cork and withdraw funds from a credit union in Dublin, and so that the movement behaves like the aggregate of what it is, namely, a large social movement.  These are important aspects missing from the legislation which need to be brought in.<\/p><p>  With regard to difficulties, I will return to the point that credit unions have 3.2 million members and our membership reflects the national demographic.  Our social breakdown is exactly as it is in the national demographic and we have the same proportion of A1s.  If something happens to the population at large economically it automatically reflects onto credit unions.  I am happy and proud to state credit unions have raised their game and done everything in their power to respond to the needs of their members while at the same time protecting the financial base of their organisation, which is owned by their members.  They have increased provisions and reserves so they are in a position to deal with members who have issues.<\/p><p>  For the 50 years of their existence credit unions have ensured they have been in a position to deal with people who through no fault of their own are in economic difficulties, and they have given priority to this.  They were born at a time when ordinary people did not have access to financial institutions or financial services, and when, if they needed funds, they were preyed upon by moneylenders.  Unfortunately we are returning to this, so we must ensure the movement is strengthened and is in a position to continue its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900010#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348065600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy Higgins's question on the United States, I am based in Washington DC and prior to joining the World Council of Credit Unions I worked for the Credit Union National Association in the United States, so I am well familiar with the US system.  Two of the features of the US system which have led it to have 94 million members and 7,200 institutions are shared branching and credit union service organisations.  Almost all credit unions in the United States belong to a shared branching network whereby one can go into any credit union and make a transaction for up to $800.  Credit unions throughout the country share ATMs.  Credit unions can co-operate with each other and achieve economies of scale which otherwise would not be possible without major amalgamations of the institutions.  These can help maintain the local character of credit unions and local autonomy while also allowing a wider range of services than would otherwise be available.<\/p><p>  With regards to term limits in the United States, for federally chartered credit unions, which make up 60% of the industry, term limits are not allowed.  They are considered to be anti-democratic.  For the other 40%, which are state chartered, it varies according to state law.  It can be voluntary.  However, usually this occurs only if there is a geriatric board which needs to engage in succession planning and needs new blood because everyone is above retirement age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900010#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Edwards"},{"type":"speech","time":1348066200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  The credit unions' work has never been as vital as it is today.  In my part of the world on the north side of Cork city the majority of people would not have a functional banking system were it not for the credit unions.  The Bill is intended to protect credit unions and their members via a proper regulatory framework.  The intention is to protect their voluntary status and local knowledge.  The banking sector remains in such a poor state because it does not allow local bank managers to work with people on the ground.  We must take the opportunity to remind people that removing power from local bank managers and forcing unnecessary lending were the reasons for the banking crisis.  Local bank managers are not being allowed to unpick some of the problems.<\/p><p>  I have two questions on the commission which met for nine months.  According to its final report, the commission's findings, on which this legislation is based, were unanimous.  Many of the points made by the delegates were reasonable, even though they lacked specific details.  They are opposed to some prohibitions and in favour of others, yet they did not go through the prohibitions in the PowerPoint presentation.  Will they provide further details?<\/p><p>  The reports of the other two bodies that were part of the nine month review - the Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA, and the Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, which will present tomorrow - requested urgent legislation along the lines of that being proposed.  Why is there a variance between the three bodies?  Have the delegates changed their position on the issues in question from the unanimous position outlined in the report which was published on 18 April?  Why does the CUMA and the CUDA not share these concerns?  The delegates cannot speak for them, but there seems to have been a change in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900011#P00100","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348066200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>There has been no change.

Credit unions meet many of the financial needs of individuals and households at a micro and medium micro level.<\/p><p>  The legislation arises out of the commission's work on the difficulties that have emerged as a result of a general financial meltdown, mainly bank driven.  The reality is that there are financial strains on some credit unions around the country.  Am I correct, that many credit unions require financial support as a result of the overspill of general financial difficulties and meltdown?  We are trying to create a framework that is well balanced in terms of addressing the type of risks and responsibilities of a voluntary and democratic-based movement in order to allow it continue into the future.  The regulation, in the form and framework presented, seeks to address those real needs going forward.<\/p><p>  The tiering system for categorising the type of operations in the credit union movement is a good idea.  There can be large volumes of simple transactions which result in big balance sheet amounts or complicated financial transactions in smaller numbers in total aggregate smaller amounts.  The risks for the second type in terms of dealings in financial products are more difficult to manage and usually have magnified consequences if they go wrong.  As such, they require tighter controls and disciplines.  I agree that if one can come up with a framework to match the realities of the two groupings of services provided that should be adopted.<\/p><p>  I would like now to put to the witnesses some nuts and bolts-type questions which I was asked by constituents to raise with them.  Given some credit unions are under greater strain than others does the Irish League of Credit Unions expect many mergers to take place?  In regard to losses incurred prior to rescue of a credit union, who pays for those losses?  Will it be the rescuer's members, rescued members or taxpayers?  The constituent who asked that question anticipates that rescuer's members will pay for them.  What will happen to the savings protection scheme fund under this legislation?  What exposure does the savings protection scheme have given the number of letters of comfort that have issued?

Credit unions do not borrow on the inter-bank markets.  They were not exposed to that type of risk taking.  The only source of capital for credit unions derives from member savings.  Currently, less than half those savings are out on loan, which the Deputy will agree is a safe position for credit unions to be in.  I refer the Deputy to the point made earlier in regard to additional capital.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will forgive me if I respond to the questions raised in the wrong order.  The issues of stabilisation and the league's savings protection scheme were raised.  There is a proposal in the Bill regarding the establishment of a State-run stabilisation scheme.  This means that league members will, when this is implemented, need to reflect on the future of their savings protection schemes.  Up to this point, stabilisation has been provided by the credit unions.  Members of the league took the initiative and put in place this safety blanket for credit unions, which has worked well over the years.  It now appears, if the legislation as published is enacted, that a State stabilisation scheme will be put in place.  The league and its members will need to reflect on this.  Members of the league will make the decision in regard to what will happen to the savings protection schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900012#Q02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1348066800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>It is an open question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012091900012#Q02600","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348067400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>It is an open question and it would not be for ourselves - the league board, the chief executive or anybody else - to make that decision.

Perhaps it is a question of capital equalisation in a merger, which could arise.  As far as we are aware, in both the report and the legislation, decisions in that respect are currently reserved for the Minister for Finance.  The operation of the restructuring fund, which is what we are discussing, is itself the subject of a state aid application to Brussels.  We and the Department of Finance eagerly await a response on that.  The types of operation that a restructuring fund can engage in will to some extent be determined by what our European colleagues tell us we can do.<\/p><p>  The number of mergers, etc., is unknown and it must remain so as the restructuring process is voluntary.  The Deputy spoke about credit unions that are in difficulty, and some may merge because they are under financial or other stress, as we have mentioned today.  There is a bigger class of credit unions which will come to this positively and look to an opportunity to come together because they can provide all of the additional services we spoke about before.  It is impossible to predict, given that the process is voluntary, how many will be involved in the end.<\/p><p>  There are significant changes afoot in this legislation, with the core alteration being the restructuring process.

Perhaps the positive example is highlighted even more by the current mess we are in.  I do not know if it is going too far to say that if the banking system as a whole operated on the basis on which the credit union movement operates, with its ethos and focus, we would not be in this mess in the first place.

In my capacity as Chairman of the committee, I addressed the Doha Forum last May on the issue of the challenges arising from the Arab spring.  I observed in the course of my presentation that, notwithstanding the pace of change in some parts of the Middle East and north Africa, the legitimate objective of the Palestinian people of establishing their own state has still not been achieved.  In fact, the situation has deteriorated in recent times.  Moreover, with the presidential election taking place in the United States in the coming months, not much will happen before the end of the year.<\/p><p>  The pace of construction of illegal settlements by Israel is a serious obstacle to progress towards a solution under which the Israeli desire to protect the security of its borders and the Palestinian objective of statehood are mutually and equally respected.  As part of its programme of work, the committee has already met this year with the Speaker of the Knesset, Mr. Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli Minister for Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs, and the ambassador at the Palestinian mission in Ireland.  Today's meeting gives us an opportunity to discuss with the EAPPI representatives how their organisation draws on volunteers' experience in the West Bank to promote its vision of bringing a just and peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on international laws and relevant United Nations resolutions.  Many members of the committee have visited Israel and Palestine in the past, some as part of a delegation from the previous committee.  I had the privilege of travelling to Israel and Gaza with the Taoiseach, when he was leader of the Opposition, in the immediate aftermath of Operation Cast Lead.  There we saw at first hand the devastation caused by the Israeli raids in Palestine.  We met with Mr. John Ging, our representative at the United Nations at that time and a person who has done trojan work for the people of Gaza.  I hope the committee will be in a position to take up an invitation for a delegation to travel to Israel and Palestine some time in 2013 in order to see the situation there for ourselves.<\/p><p>  I am sure members will have plenty of questions for the delegates.  I invite Mr. O'Brien to make his opening contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012091900003#B00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348061400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to present to them today.  The Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel is essentially a human rights observer programme established ten years ago by the World Council of Churches.  Observers are recruited from various countries around the globe to live and work at seven locations across the West Bank for between three and four and a half months.  Volunteers are recruited for this purpose from the United Kingdom and Ireland by Quaker Peace &amp;amp; Social Witness in London.  To date, 20 Irish people have served in the field for EAPPI.  I was placed in the Bethlehem area for three months in 2009, while my colleague, Mr. Emmet Sheerin, returned in July from a four and a half month stay at two different locations, where he was at the coalface of the problems caused by illegal settlements.  The other colleague who has accompanied me today, Mr. David Heap, returned on Sunday after a three-month placement.  Observers are deployed to offer protection through non-violent presence, monitor and report violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, support acts of non-violent resistance alongside local Palestinian and Israeli activists, and engage in public policy advocacy.<\/p><p>  I will hand over now to Mr. Sheerin, who will speak about his experiences in the field.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012091900003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348061400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>As my colleague mentioned, I recently spent four and a half months in the West Bank.  My time was divided between the South Hebron Hills, in the southernmost part of the West Bank, and the small village of Yanoun in the north of the West Bank, from where I visited the Jordan Valley on several occasions.  These locations are in area C, which compromises more than 60% of the West Bank territory, meaning they are under the full control of Israel.  There I witnessed at first hand the impact the Israeli settlement enterprise and related Israeli policies are having on vulnerable Palestinian communities.  The challenges people face include the dispossession of land and water resources and the demolition of homes and other vital structures.  Together with the rise in violence against Palestinians by extremist Israeli settlers, this situation places thousands of Palestinian men, women and children at serious risk of displacement.<\/p><p>  The image on screen is of a woman from the village of Susiya in the South Hebron Hills.  Members will notice the bruise under her eye.  I took this photo in March after seven Israeli settlers had attacked the woman as she herded sheep on her family's land.  The seven men approached from the nearby Israeli settlement, hit her in the face with a rock and beat her with iron bars.  Not only do this woman and her entire community live with the constant threat of violence, but much of their land has been made inaccessible because of the settlement.  The buffer zone that surrounds it is off-limits to Palestinians, even though it contains much of the villagers' agricultural land and water resources.  In addition, almost the entire village of Susiya is at risk of imminent demolition by the Israeli authorities.  In June the Israeli military issued demolition orders in respect of more than 50 structures in the village, including homes.  There is also a pending demolition order against the village school.  If carried out, these demolitions will directly affect more than 100 people.<\/p><p>  The small village of Yanoun in the northern West Bank is surrounded on three sides by Israeli settlement outposts.  In 2002 residents had to flee their homes following a sustained campaign of violence by Israeli settlers.  They eventually returned, but only with the support of international and Israeli human rights activists.  There is now a permanent international observer presence in Yanoun, in which I participated for a time.  The settlers, with the support of the Israeli military, have taken over a vast amount of Yanoun's agricultural land.  According to Rashed, the mayor of Yanoun, who is pictured on the screen, before the establishment of the settlements the villagers had nothing to fear.  Now they live with the constant threat of violence and forced displacement.<\/p><p>  Close to Yanoun is the Jordan Valley, where Israel's exploitation of Palestinian land and vital resources was most evident to me.<\/p> <p>According to United Nations statistics, there are 37 Israeli settlements in the Jordan Valley and Dead Sea area.  Between the settlements and the military, therefore, Israel controls a vast amount of land and a major proportion of the water resources in the area.  The generous allocation of water to settlers - at the expense of local Palestinians - has enabled them to develop a major agricultural export industry.  Human Rights Watch has pointed out that most of the agricultural exports from the northern part of the Jordan Valley go to Europe.  At the same time, Israel is preventing the development of Palestinian communities through the systematic demolition of homes or imposing severe restrictions on freedom of movement.  Furthermore, the human rights organisation B'Tselem points out some Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley consume 40% less water than the minimum daily amount recommended by the WHO.  The Israeli settlements are completely illegal under international law.  There is no escaping the fact, however, that the import and sale of products from the settlement supports this illegal enterprise.  There is also the related dispossession and displacement of Palestinian communities.  Mr. O'Brien will speak in more detail on the subject of settlement products.<\/p><p> The picture shown in the final slide is of a man I met in the Jordan Valley who had just received a demolition order in respect of his home.  Despite being immensely frustrated about his family's situation, he still expressed some hope that the international community - in particular, European states - would respond to their needs and put pressure on Israel to cease its violations of human rights and international law.  It is time that we translated strong words into real deeds in respect of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012091900003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Emmet Sheerin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348062000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>For over three years it has been one of our main advocacy aims to push for a ban on settlement products in Ireland.  It is important to say that such products are available on the Irish market.  This is the bottom line and unfortunately it shows that Ireland is indirectly supporting Israel's illegal settlements.  The value of illegal settlement products on the Irish market is extremely difficult to assess, particularly in view of the volume and variety of goods imported into the jurisdiction.  However, I will provide some examples.  We had some slides in respect of this matter but I do not see a printed version of the picture of the produce of a company called Keter.  The latter operates in the Barkan industrial estate, which is near the illegal settlement of Ariel in Occupied Palestinian Territory.  If one visits Woodies, B&amp;Q or Argos, one can buy some of Keter's plastic garden furniture and storage products.<\/p><p>  SodaStream products are also available on the Irish market.  We have provided a picture of such products in one of the hand-outs.  This picture was taken in a DID Electrical store in Dublin.  SodaStream is located in the Mishor Edomim industrial park, which is situated to the east of Jerusalem in occupied Palestinian territory.  I draw members attention to a detailed report about SodaStream and its activities in the occupied territory, which was compiled by an Israeli-Palestinian research project called Who Profits.  The latter has an online database which provides details on the companies that operate in illegal settlements and export to various countries internationally.  In our short one-page written submission, we identify some of the companies that operate in illegal settlements and export to Ireland.  In terms of imports to Ireland from Israel, the value is in the region of &euro;70 to &euro;80 million.  We suspect, however, that imports of illegal settlement products would only constitute a very small percentage of this figure.<\/p><p>  There is a growing legal opinion that it would be viable for member states of the EU to ban illegal settlement products unilaterally and without the need for EU approval.  A renowned international law professor from Cambridge, James Crawford, published an opinion in that regard earlier this year via the Trade Union Council in the UK.  This can be found in one of the documents we have circulated to members.  We are faced with the reality of illegal settlement products being available in Ireland.  In our opinion and that of an eminent legal expert, the Government has the necessary legal framework available to it to institute a ban.  Why should we do this now?<\/p><p>  As the Chairman stated, for many years Irish Governments have strongly supported the Palestinians' need for their own state.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade must be complimented on his efforts in this regard.  In the context of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the formation of foreign policy can be frustrating.  It can often seem, for example, that as a distant third party we can have little influence on the situation.  However, the extraordinarily positive thing we can say is that, despite this conflict being so far away, protracted and harmful and destructive in so many ways for many decades, the Irish Government and those who can influence it have the opportunity and the power to make a tangible contribution to laying the ground for a just and peaceful solution.<\/p><p>  We propose that concerted political efforts be made to institute a national ban on illegal settlement products.  This suggestion is not as radical as it might sound.  Banning settlement products would merely be a dissociation from breaches of international law.  Ireland is connected to the illegal settlement policies and realities and what we are proposing is a simple clearing of conscience.  If we do not do this, then we will continue to support one of the biggest barriers to peace.  We ask the committee to propose to the T&aacute;naiste that cross-departmental measures be initiated in order to start the practical process towards discovering how such products can be banned.  What is particularly strong about the proposal to ban settlement products is the fact that it is not an act against the state of Israel; it is very clearly an action against Israel's illegal actions and not the legitimate state of Israel, which we all recognise.  On each occasion we advocate a ban of illegal settlement products, we must make it clear that such a ban is simply a dissociation from illegality.<\/p><p>  Illegal settlements have increasingly become the focus of attention at US, EU and UN level.  The Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister recently indicated his country is considering such a ban.  There is clearly an appetite on a variety of fronts internationally for taking action in respect of illegal settlements.  However, the requisite leadership at international level does not appear to exist at present.  We are of the view that Ireland should take the lead on this matter.  While our international economic reputation has taken a huge hit, we still have an international reputation for the protection of human rights.  We are of the view that the country must live up to the latter.  If Ireland displays further leadership on this issue, others will follow and illegal settlements could be isolated - economically and politically - for what they are, namely, illegal, destructive and barriers to peace.  In that context, we ask the committee to commit to pushing the agenda of banning the importation of settlement products at national level.  We also ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to initiate cross-departmental measures to start us off on the path towards getting illegal settlement products off the Irish market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012091900004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1348062000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for updating us on what is happening on the ground in the Middle East.

They made a couple of points during their presentations, one of which is that their job relates to offering support in respect of acts of non-violent resistance.  In that regard, I am conscious of the events involving Rachel Corrie.  Ms Corrie, an innocent woman involved in a non-violent action, was wearing a high-visibility vest when she was run over by an IDF vehicle.  What impact did Ms Corrie's death have in the context of our guests' experiences in Palestine and Israel?

It amazes me how people in the depths of despair can still have the hope that someone's conscience will be pricked to do something about this.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade said that if matters got worse we would probably go down the path of banning the products.  What could get worse in terms of the circumstances of people on the ground?<\/p><p> The witnesses talked about demolition.  Why would people's homes be demolished?

I am familiar with its work; a friend of mine was in Palestine last year and another friend was there as part of a Christian church group, doing fairly similar work.  The work the witnesses do is great because it has a dual approach in that it is a protective presence but is also reporting back.

It is very useful work. <\/p><p>  My question is similar to Deputy Smith's.  On the issue of settlements, apart from the human misery the witnesses have seen them cause to families every day, they are also rapidly lessening by attrition the chances of there ever being a two-state solution, because the amount of land left is rapidly becoming unsustainable as a state.<\/p><p>  I agree with the witnesses that something needs to happen, and they recommend a ban on importing produce from the settlements.

Would it be better for us to work as part of the European Union?  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?

We do not know their value, but they are a small percentage of what is coming in.<\/p><p>  On the question of whether this has been raised at EU level, it has, and we would also support that line of approach.  For us, the downside of the EU approach is that all it needs is one veto and it would not work.  There is more than one country which I believe would veto it, but perhaps I am being pessimistic.  The value in moving unilaterally is due to the political symbolism.  It will not be that it will have a direct economic impact because there is not that large a volume of settlement produce in terms of euros.  However, we believe there is a willingness and an openness among the international community to do something about it.  It is just waiting for some state player to act.  There appear to be indications that, for example, the UK, Denmark and France would be that way inclined as well, but it needs someone to make the first move, which is why we favoured the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade focusing on a national ban rather than just an EU ban.  We believe there are too many variables and it is too big to get an EU ban put through, whereas the symbolism of a national ban could be very powerful.<\/p><p>  On the impact of the Rachel Corrie case, I would stress how well we are prepared and how well we are managed on the ground.  We get rigorous training and the recruitment process is also quite rigorous.  When we are on the ground we are carefully managed.  We would have a good deal of local information about where the dangerous places are.  We put ourselves in areas where there is a risk of some kind of conflict but generally our presence prevents that.  We are carefully trained in how to manage ourselves if conflict does happen.  After the Rachel Corrie incident it is always in the back of our minds that this is something that could happen to us in the field, but we are very well prepared.<\/p><p>  Some of Deputy Crowe's questions might have been somewhat rhetorical.

For Palestinians it is almost impossible to get permits.  These structures are in area C of the West Bank and Israel has full control over civil as well as security affairs.  The Palestinians have to apply to the Israeli authorities for planning permission and nine times out of ten it will be denied.  It is also a lengthy and expensive process.  The Palestinian communities are forced to build for their needs.  Instead of changing the policy of mass demolition and making it a more fair and transparent process, Israel enforces the policy of mass demolition.  Incidentally, the committee should be aware that European-funded structures have been demolished in the West Bank and, consequently, there has been a loss of European money.<\/p><p>  In regard to the hope that the man to whom I referred raised with me - one might ask why, at present, one would have hope at all - the answer is that he and many people in his community had in the past looked towards America to see what it had been doing.

I was in the West Bank when the T&aacute;naiste made his remarks about settlement produce.

We have heard strong words from the EU Council on a variety of potential actions that could be taken on this extremely complex area.

Individual citizens feel powerless and we as parliamentarians sometimes feel powerless to change the situation.  The T&aacute;naiste has set out his position clearly.  The European Union must act in a much more vigorous way.  I met recently with Pierre Vimont, the head of the External Action Service in the European Union.  I sensed his frustration and that of officials about the glacial pace of the European Union's response to issues relating to the Palestinian-Israeli situation.  Far be it from me to directly quote such an eminent figure as Pierre Vimont but that was the thrust of his contribution to the meeting, among other contributions he made.<\/p><p>  It is important for us to put on record our support, if the committee can reach agreement, for a national ban on imports of products from illegal settlements.

We must convince our European colleagues that it is not just a symbolic way to make a stand but is also a practical way to convince Israeli public opinion that this is not acceptable any longer, that we cannot tolerate this and that the international community will not tolerate it.  The Palestinian people need an ally in the European Union because they have been let down by the United States.  They are at the mercy of each and every electoral cycle.  That is not acceptable.

If one were to ask someone on O'Connell Street this afternoon to name a product they would find it difficult to pinpoint one.

I am involved in other human rights issues and great things are expected if President Obama is re-elected.  Perhaps this is another item to put onto the list.

I would like to hear about the role of Israeli people in that because not all Israelis agree with what their Government is doing.<\/p><p>  My last question relates to the witnesses, the effect of their presence and that of people like them in Palestine.

As Deputy O'Sullivan said, the issue has gone off the agenda.  There are a number of reasons for that.  The American presidential election is taking place and it is not a major issue of focus such as during Bill Clinton's time.  He spent a long time trying to do something about it, unsuccessfully, as he did with situations in other countries, including in this part of the world.  A former member of the committee, now President Michael D. Higgins, was of the opinion - I am sure remains so - that the real cause of problems was the lack of a particular area to lodge complaints, a secretariat or permanent structure to which complaints of the nature outlined could be lodged and addressed.  That still has not happened.  It was one of the things that did happen in this country.  There was a secretariat in Hillsborough where contentious issues were put on the table and both sides had to respond in some way, whether to their own embarrassment or otherwise, but issues were aired in that fashion.  I do not know what we can do to further that approach other than to do what we can as members of the European Union and to try to bring the influence of fellow members of the Union to focus on the issue.<\/p><p>  We must also examine the extent to which we can be of benefit through the United Nations.  That is highly questionable due to the attitude of countries in terms of allowing the UN to interfere in what is perceived to be an internal issue.  However, we must be seen to do something that will focus on the issues and enable people who have grievances to air them in public and address them.  We can have all the reports in the world and the efforts which have been outlined by the witnesses, in addition to the visits we have made in the past - it is a long time since I was first in the region and my hair was a different colour then - but it is sad that nothing has changed since.  That is one of the problems.  If there was a permanent secretariat to address grievances there would at least be a recognition - perhaps it would take a long time - of the existence of the other persons and their right to an existence as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012091900006#E00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1348063200,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for attending the meeting.  The Quaker organisation and other Christian groups are doing tremendous work.  I am very impressed with the Keep Hope Alive campaign which centres on the planting of olive trees in the Palestinian areas.  Like other speakers I thank the witnesses for their observations and reporting back because it is ultimately a political issue that must be resolved.  It is a tragedy that we are becoming more and more desperate and frustrated in the face of the outbursts and racism of the Israeli settlers.  A response is not forthcoming on an internationally agreed platform to the human rights issues and the illegality of what is going on in the Occupied Territories.<\/p> <p>The Palestinian ambassador, whom we meet on a regular basis, is frustrated that the two state solution is rapidly becoming more difficult to achieve, essentially because of the unaccountability of the Israelis and the settlers in particular.  The speaker of the Knesset and a delegation of parliamentarians from Israel came before this committee.  It was remarkable that the speaker was a fifth generation Israeli who had an understanding of the culture of the Arab people.  His bright, young Russian emigrant minister was the opposite.  <\/p><p> I presume these settlements are being driven by Israel's immigration policy.  These people are new arrivals in an ancient land and they have nothing but contempt for the indigenous people.  It was interesting, however, that even the speaker of the Knesset is on public record as being outraged at the increasing ferocity of the settlers' racist approach and attitudes to the indigenous Arab-Palestinian population.  We should at least recognise that as something progressive that is being debated in the Israeli parliament.<\/p><p> We had a presentation by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his understanding and empathy in terms of the issues pertaining in the Occupied Territories was interesting.  He said that if there was no response to the illegality we may have to consider banning produce or demanding the labelling of produce from the Occupied Territories.  Next year will be interesting as we will hold the Presidency of the European Union and I hope we can continue that degree of lobbying of the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p><p> It is frightening that Prime Minister Netanyahu can attempt to intimidate President Obama, in the middle of the presidential election in America, by demanding his response to the Iranian nuclear issue.  We have a major international power, a powerful and wealthy country, and a dispossessed and disparate Palestinian population.  The delegation has given the committee the report of the gentleman who said that despite being immensely frustrated by his family situation he still had some hope that the international community, particularly European states, would respond to their needs and apply real pressure.  The question was asked whether the European Union was doing anything.  I understand that the European Parliament's international trade committee has met and is reviewing what it calls the protocol in the association agreement between the EU and Israel, in this context regarding pharmaceutical products.  A political debate is taking place in Europe on the protocol and there are some who will argue that unless there is compliance by the Israelis with international law we should seek a deferment of that international agreement for at least two years to allow the Israelis address the illegalities taking place.  I urge the committee to engage with our MEPs, on behalf of this country, speaking in the Parliament.  This is not a party political broadcast.  We should use the services of all our elected MEPs to engage thoroughly in that debate.  It will be a brave and difficult move but we should also call the T&aacute;naiste to account for his initial suggestion that we may consider banning products and perhaps ask him to take that action in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012091900006#E00600","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348063800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the delegation.  We met previously.  I compliment them on the work they are doing.  It is not without some personal risk and it is valuable work.<\/p><p>  I feel a sense of frustration because people have raised the issue of the two state solution.  I note from the notes we get from the Government that it is concerned that is now at considerable risk because of the settlements.  There is a stage at which the two state solution may no longer be viable.  In the West Bank area mentioned earlier there are now more Israelis than Palestinians.  The continuation of that would look like a policy deliberately engineered to thwart the two state solution.  I do not know what to say in regard to that.<\/p><p>  The witnesses have taken a measured and minimalist approach in seeking the ban on foods coming from the settlements and are asking this committee to get our Government to institute that country-wide.  I concur with that approach.  We should put that proposal to the meeting to see if the committee will agree with it because it is important that the Government would take two steps, one of which I picked up from the Trades Union Congress letter.  The first one would be what the delegation is asking for and the second would be that it would conduct due diligence across all Government services to identify where they might inadvertently be aiding and abetting the illegal settlements.  The TUC is putting such a proposal to the British Government.  The delegation might let us know if there is a response from the British Government to that because it would be welcome.  That would give us credibility going into the European Presidency in that we could seek the labelling of such produce as a first step.  We should do it step by step.  Politicians generally kick to touch, and we need to make difficult decisions in this regard.<\/p><p>  I have a number of questions for the delegation.  First, have its members had any discussions with retailers here?  The letter from the TUC states that in Britain most of the multiples now have very little, if any, offending products on their shelves.  Has there been any campaign here, and what has been the response of the multiples here?<\/p><p>  Second, to where are the settlement products mainly exported?  Ireland would account for an infinitesimal amount of the overall number but as the witnesses said, from the point of view of making a statement and giving leadership, it would be important but to where does the majority of it go?  I have asked that question previously and I understand from the witnesses' answer that they believe there is not support for that but the illegal settlements are in place at the direction of the Israeli Government.  They would not be there otherwise.  Why is it not broadened to include all Israeli goods?  I am inclined to agree with the witnesses' argument that we should go with this to determine how effective it is but in the background we should not rule out extending it if the Israeli Government, as it clearly appears, is acting illegally and against international law in this area.<\/p><p>  We must be balanced in this regard also.  Representatives of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; faith were here recently and they spoke specifically about Iran.  The committee made a case to the Iranian ambassador about Padre Youcef Nadarkhani who was sentenced to death for apostasy.  I understand that apostasy is a capital offence in Palestine.  Is that correct?  I have been approached by people who take a different view than me on these matters.  Arguments are being put to us which, if they are true, weaken the case that we can make and it is important that this is addressed to some extent because all the rights and wrongs do not come down on one individual side.  As is the case in most disputes, there is varying degrees of culpability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012091900007#F00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1348063800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I travelled with the Taoiseach to the West Bank to see the illegal settlements and the difficulties faced by the Palestinian people, even to cross the road.

He said the land exchange issue would be very difficult because the best fertile land has been taken over.

It would take a lot.<\/p> <p>We do not advocate that approach either because, while I know where the members are coming from, it reduces it to a consumer issue.  This is not really a consumer issue but one of international humanitarian and human rights law.  We really feel it is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to address it rather than depict it as a matter of which consumers should be aware.  That said, I draw attention to our colleagues in Tr&oacute;caire who are to launch a campaign soon on settlement products.<\/p><p> It is not our policy to advocate a boycott of all Israeli products.  That would be detrimental to a settlement in the longer term and, at a practical level, we do not believe there would be support for it, certainly at EU level.  I do not have the percentage to hand but the European Union is by far the largest trading partner with Israel and the illegal settlements.<\/p><p> We certainly acknowledge that addressing human rights abuses and human rights law across the board is not the sole responsibility of Israel.

The villagers tell us constantly that if we were not present &ndash; EAPPI has a permanent international presence all year round in the village - they would leave.  This is a clear example of the real impact we have.  In the south Hebron hills, there was an instance in which international bodies were able to bring media attention to the threatened demolition of solar panels in a village called Imneizil.  They were EU funded, possibly through Spain.  The international presence resulted in media attention and there was a freeze on the demolition of the vital solar panels.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan also asked about people in Israel who do not agree with the occupation of Palestinian territory and who are actively campaigning against it.  We work quite closely with Israeli peace activists.  There are many groups, including Rabbis for Human Rights and B'Tselem, a well-regarded human rights organisation.  It is very important that we stand in solidarity with these people because they work in a very difficult environment.  There are certain Israelis who are campaigning actively against what is happening.

The penalty points system is almost ten years old.  It seems like a quick decade but a review is appropriate at this stage.  AA Ireland is well known and is the major motoring organisation in this country.  We have some 200,000 Irish members and we fix 140,000 cars per year.  We regularly engage with the motoring public from a consumer perspective.  We have a long-standing heritage as a campaigning organisation and we have a vested interest in the sense that we represent motorists from a consumer perspective.  Nevertheless, we have always been very supportive of road safety initiatives and we worked in partnership with the State and its agencies over the past 15 or 20 years to promote road safety in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s penalty points system has been a success story.  It was launched in October of 2002 and enjoyed widespread support from motorists from the start.  It has been one of the key policies, along with improvements in policing, engineering and a sea change in social attitudes, that has underscored remarkable progress in improving road safety.  I was very involved in the AA&rsquo;s campaign to have a penalty points system introduced.  I had a number of meetings with the then Minister, S&eacute;amus Brennan, to persuade him to support the idea.  It is appropriate in this forum to pay tribute to the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  He was terrific and pushed through the introduction of penalty points when many others wanted to delay.<\/p><p>  Ten years later, we are reviewing a system that is, on the face of it, very successful.  It has worked brilliantly.  Road deaths have halved in the past decade.  We also know from the data that, when drivers gets two or four penalty points, it changes their behaviour.  A driver with four points is statistically less likely to get caught again than someone who is points-free.  The number of drivers accumulating multiple points, culminating in disqualification, is very small.  The yellow card system works and it raises the question of why we should fix it if it is not broken.<\/p><p>  One of the merits in the proposed changes is that it would make our system look more similar to the one that exists in Northern Ireland and the UK, such as increasing a speeding offence up to three points.  There is a good reason to do that to aid future harmonisation and mutual recognition with Northern Ireland.  Both jurisdictions want to see this.<\/p><p>  The AA engages with motoring public through blogs, e-zines and our website.  We also systematically research motorists' opinions through the AA motorists panel online surveys.  We get fantastic levels of engagement.  When we survey motorists on the issues of the day, we regularly get 12,000 completed questionnaires.  For some surveys, we received over 20,000 questionnaires and hundreds of thousands of individual comments from motorists.  We have a very good handle on how motorists view issues.  There is widespread support when we ask about penalty points.  Nearly 17% of Irish drivers have penalty points on their record currently but the vast majority of those have only one incidence of one or two points on their licences.<\/p><p>  It gets more interesting when we ask drivers whether it was fair on the last occasion they received penalty points.  Just over half of the motorist we spoke to, 50.6%, felt the circumstances in which they had received penalty points were somewhat unfair or very unfair.  We received many individual comments and their tone reveals a degree of public cynicism about the way in which the penalty points system operates and the way the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertakes speeding enforcement.  The old barstool conspiracy theory is that it is a revenue generating exercise.  That is not fair or true but the unfairness may be in the eye of the beholder.  It remains a concern for policymakers, because we cannot have a motoring population that becomes cynical about road safety enforcement.  It is an ongoing communications challenge for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority and the Government.  If we fuel public cynicism, we will undermine support for road safety policies.<\/p><p>  One of the suggestions in a discussion document from the Department is that speeding should become more than one offence.  Exceeding the speed limit by a small margin should be in a different category from the driver with a gross violation of the speed limit.  It is a reasonable proposal but it is important to put on the record the fact that the AA does not believe we can do it yet.  First, we must fix the widespread problem of poorly set speed limits.  We must fix that once and for all before we start policing the speed limit with greater vigour.  As part of the polling exercise with motorists, we carried out a review of poorly set speed limits earlier this year.  We received thousands of examples from the motoring public in a survey with more than 20,000 respondents.  We shared the results with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department is now in the process of undertaking a speed limit review.  It is important that the review is completed and acted upon so that poorly set speed limits that pepper the network are corrected before we move to a stronger sanction for speeding violations.<\/p><p>  The other eye-catching suggestion that emerged from the Department, which received much reaction from our members, is the notion that there should be tougher penalties for mobile phone use.  Interestingly, motorists collectively really believe in that idea.  They believe strongly that mobile phone use is an unforgivable offence.  Over 17% of the motorists we polled favour an outright driving ban for a motorist caught using a mobile phone.<\/p> <p>Some 60% of respondents expressed the view that mobile phone usage while driving should be punished much more severely than is the case.  It seems to be one of those behaviours in other drivers which drives people demented.  At the same time, however, more than 50% of respondents in one of our polls acknowledged that they occasionally used their mobile phone while driving, with some 40% admitting they occasionally sent a text message, even though the latter was universally acknowledged as an unforgivable behaviour.  We have, therefore, a cohort of the population which is of the view that these offences should be punished very severely, while, at the same time, the people concerned admit that they will occasionally engage in these behaviours themselves.  Moreover, the motorists to whom we talk are invariably of the view, where they were apprehended for such behaviour in the past, that the garda in question dealt with them unfairly.  In other words, there is a clear disconnect between what people say and what they do.  As such, I caution against giving undue weight to a populist line which might lead one to assume there is strong support for very severe punishments.  I am certain that if such an approach were taken, we would soon discover that while support for harsh punishments might be very wide, it is not very deep.  People will inevitably and rapidly turn against a system they consider to be too severe.<\/p><p> We must be cautious in introducing changes to the system.  For example, while 17% of people expressed the view that motorists caught using a mobile phone while driving should be put off the road, most of us would agree that this seems rather too severe.  One of the issues to bear in mind as we review the penalty points system is that punishments must remain proportionate to the offence.  This is essential if we are to ensure a driver's penalty points status accurately reflects his or her behaviour and collision risk.  Penalty points status is one of the factors the insurance industry takes into account when assessing risk.  The EU gender directive which comes into force at the end of this year will lead to an even greater forensic focus on penalty points because gender will no longer be permissible as a risk assessment factor.  It is vital that there should be no disconnect between a driver's points status and a genuine underlying accident risk.  If penalty points are handed out like confetti for relatively trivial offences, such a disconnect is unavoidable.<\/p><p> A phenomenon that is not widespread but which requires close observation - perhaps specific legislative provision - is that of penalty points swapping.  When we asked motorists whether they had ever been asked to accept penalty points on another driver's behalf, 2% confirmed that they had.  There are two distinct circumstances in which such a scenario might arise.  The first is where a person, for a variety of reasons, accepts a penalty points sanction on behalf of his or her spouse or partner.  The second scenario is where an individual with an out-of-State licence volunteers that licence in the knowledge that no penalty points can be applied to it in order to allow an Irish licence holder to escape sanction.  For example, in the case of a couple where one partner is British and the other Irish, the British licence is invariably volunteered for sanction.  That loophole must be closed.  There is also evidence - although it is anecdotal and should not, therefore, be overstated - of employers engaging in systematic penalty points swapping.  Where, for instance, there are six drivers in a fleet, it might be the established custom that whenever any of them is intercepted by a speed camera, the out-of-State licence is volunteered for sanction.  As I said, this type of practice is not widespread, but it is certainly happening.  If the legislation is being reviewed, consideration should be given to strengthening existing provisions or introducing sanctions to close the loophole that is being exploited in this way.<\/p><p> In some ways, the penalty points system has become almost a victim of its own success.  What I mean by this is that it is working so effectively that I find myself - members might have had the same experience - being approached by certain parties with a view to using the penalty points mechanism as a means of enforcing certain behaviours that have nothing to do with road safety.  A classic example of this was when I was approached by representatives of ASH, a very worthwhile and laudable organisation which works to eliminate tobacco use in Ireland, with a proposal that smoking while driving should incur penalty points.  There might be many good reasons to introduce such an offence in terms of reducing the incidence of smoking, but it has nothing to do with road safety.  Penalty points might well be effective in encouraging compliance with all types of behaviours.  For example, a good way of encouraging payment of the household charge would be to apply two penalty points to the licences of those who fail to do so.  However, just because the penalty points system has proved so effective does not mean we should abuse it or leverage in other issues that have nothing to do with road safety.<\/p><p> Penalty points must remain exclusively a road safety measure and a driver's penalty points status must be an accurate reflection of past behaviour and future risk.  By applying conditions that bear no relation to road safety concerns or punishing relatively routine traffic offences with penalty points sanctions that are too severe we would quickly be facing two consequences.  First, we would create a disconnect between penalty points status and collision risk which would undermine the usefulness of the penalty points system for insurance purposes and, second, we would erode the broad public support for the way in which the system operates, a support that has been persistent for the past ten years.  For these reasons, I counsel the committee against an emotional response which might lead to a system that is needlessly and disproportionately severe in some areas.<\/p><p> A review of the penalty points system is appropriate, but it should be evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  It is a system that has served us very well and is working effectively.  There is certainly a need to facilitate future harmonisation with the systems in Northern Ireland and Britain.  In addition, there may be room for tweaking punishments and introducing new offences.  However, it is a question of fine tuning and evolutionary amendments rather than radical or drastic change.  Within these caveats, the AA will be very happy, as, I am sure, will the vast majority of motorists, to support some of the proposals the Department is bringing forward in terms of changing the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348044000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Faughnan for his solid overview of the Automobile Association's position.

Rather than going through our submission in detail, I will touch on the main points.  Ireland's road safety performance has improved dramatically in recent years, with the table on page 2 of our submission showing the change from when we first began collecting fatality records in 1959.  In 1972, for instance, 640 people were killed on the roads at a time when there were only 700,000 registered vehicles and a population of 2.5 million.  Last year, by contrast, 186 people were killed, out of a population of 4.4 million with 2.6 million registered vehicles.  This is a tremendous success story for Ireland and the Oireachtas and proof that citizens have truly embraced the road safety message.  However, while last year's figure represents a dramatic improvement, a death toll of 186 is still far too high for a civilised society.  If we were to achieve the status of safest country in Europe in terms of road safety, that would equate to a loss of lives in the order of 140 people per annum.  In other words, there is still work to be done.  The first table on page 3 shows that we have moved into fifth place in terms of safety across the European Union, as measured in deaths per 1 million of population.  There is no reason we cannot be the very safest and thus save more citizens' lives, prevent catastrophic injuries for individuals and reduce the associated cost burden for families, communities and health provision across the State.  <\/p><p>  Another measure of a country's road safety performance is deaths per 1 billion km travelled.  As members will see from the second table on page 3, Ireland is the third safest country in Europe by this measure.  This tells us that as a country we rely massively on private vehicles, using them far more than our counterparts across Europe.  This has to do with public transport provision, dispersed living and other factors.  Our status in third place is a huge achievement by citizens and the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>The graph on page 4 of my submission shows the results of some of the interventions in road safety.  I cannot point to one action that saves all these lives as there are many interventions.  Penalty points are a significant part of this, however.<\/p><p> When penalty points were first introduced in 2002, we saw a dramatic drop in fatalities in the next two years.  Unfortunately, the system was not computerised and the volumes of enforcement expected did not happen.  Our citizens cottoned on very quickly to the fact that the risk of being detected and prosecuted was very low.  Behaviour changed very quickly after that and there was an increase in fatalities for the next two years.  A feature of penalty points systems across Europe is that they are seen to have a dramatic and immediate effect but that it is exceptionally difficult to sustain this.  That is why the time chosen to review penalty points is opportune in reinvigorating them.<\/p><p> The good news is that this year to date we have four fewer fatalities than at the same time last year.  We are on track to have our seventh year in a row of reductions in people killed and injured on our roads.  I have included several tables showing the numbers of penalty point detections for certain key offences since 2008.  As Mr. Conor Faughnan alluded to earlier, fewer penalty points were issued in the first eight months of this year than in the same period last year.  There may be many reasons for that such as increased compliance, fewer journey times due to the price of fuel, not as much enforcement and so forth.  It is very difficult to unpack and understand what exactly is at play.<\/p><p> We need to be very careful that the measure of success is not the number of people who get penalty points.  What we need to see is high volumes of enforcement and low levels of detection.  It is wrong to measure the success of the enforcement work by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or how many citizens get penalty points and fines.  I would much rather see very high levels of enforcement that are visible, acting as a real deterrent with very few citizens getting detected.  It is important that the measure of success in any road safety intervention should not be the number of people caught but the number of people deterred from certain driving behaviour.<\/p><p> The wearing of seat belts is always a significant issue.  Ireland now has the best safety belt wearing rates in Europe.  It is now the norm for people in front seats to wear a seat belt.  Unfortunately, rear seat belt rates among adolescents are slightly lower.  Primary school children are very good.  On school buses and organised bus transport, younger children who tend to sit at the front of the bus wear safety belts.  Notwithstanding the horror of Kentstown and other similar collisions, those who sit further back on the bus tend not to wear safety belts.  We need to find mechanisms to deal with this.  Unfortunately, there is even vandalism of safety belts taking place on the bus fleet.<\/p><p> Research published last week by the European Union, Best Point, a project of which the Road Safety Authority was part, reviewed penalty points systems across all 27 EU member states.  Of these, 21 member states have some penalty points type system in place which are typically called demerit point systems.  It is a credit to the Oireachtas to have brought in the legislation for penalty points.  It is now widely accepted by the population and it has been tremendously successful.  The committee is trying to reinvigorate the system and keep it acceptable to the population.<\/p><p> The EU research has several proposals for a properly functioning penalty points system.  The first and key element is there must be a high chance of a driver losing his or her licence backed up by appropriate enforcement.  Drivers who break road safety rules need to feel there is a likelihood they will lose their licences if caught.  The sanction must be real.  That is why we need the high volumes of visible enforcement which will change behaviour and, hopefully, lead to fewer detections.<\/p><p> It is strongly recommended that penalty points should apply to offences that have a clear and demonstrable link to road safety and which are related to more serious issues that have a direct link to collision outcome and severity.  Since penalty points are seen as so successful, people may want to attach other offences to penalty points.  Over the summer there was a suggestion penalty points would be given to a driver if his or her vehicle was identified in tipping rubbish in a rural area.  While I understand the problem, for the penalty points system to be credible, drivers need to understand that the offences relate to behaviours that have a direct impact on collisions and their severity.  There should be a direct link to the number of points and the severity of the offence.  There may be a mismatch with some of the points.  Five points for not having a NCT and two points for driving while on a mobile telephone do not reflect the risks involved.  They must be calibrated so the points are proportionate to the offence, the public can see it is dangerous behaviour and it is a tariff, not some arbitrary figure.<\/p><p> It is important to recognise that drivers are not a homogenous group and one size does not fit all.  There are particular driver groups which are at particular risk such as, for example, young and inexperienced drivers.  We need particular waiting times for people on a learner permit and for the first three years after passing a test when one is most at risk.  We need particular interventions to deal with professional drivers and particular types of driving behaviour.  There needs to be a tariff that reflects the risk for particular groups of drivers so that it is not applying to a 60 year old.  There must be some attempt to target particular groups and change behaviour relative to risk and the propensity to be involved in a collision.<\/p><p> The third key pillar the report recommends that what should underline a good penalty points system is enforcement and publicity.  These two elements go hand in hand.  The report also recommends moderate to high levels of enforcement.  The system is a waste of time if it is not enforced and the threat is not out there.  There needs to be a tremendous amount of public education and awareness.  People need to understand the driving behaviour involved and what the risk is, what is expected and the consequences.  This must be backed up by rigorous enforcement.<\/p><p> There must be a mandatory duty on vehicle owners to identify the drivers involved in an offence, a point made in the AA&rsquo;s submission.  There is behaviour not just in Ireland but across the EU of nominating someone else to take the points.  There is no compulsion on the vehicle owner to say who was actually driving the vehicle at the time of the offence.  The report recommends that where the owner of the vehicle fails to identify the driver, the points should be given to the owner and stop this notion of giving it to an out-of-state driver.<\/p><p> It is not just enough to give people penalty points.  We need to ensure we help people not to lose their licences.  There are interventions, or what we might call remedial measures, that may help a driver with five or six points not to lose his or her licence.  It could involve sending out regular warning letters to drivers with six points explaining that four more points would mean losing their licence.  There could also be driver improvement courses in which people could voluntarily take some tuition with an approved driving instructor.  The report strongly recommends that those drivers who lose their licence because of dangerous behaviour should have compulsory rehabilitation before they get the licence back.  For some offences, people may be required to resit their driving test before giving them the privilege of returning their licence.  In the case of a driver with an underlying drug or alcohol addiction problem, there may be a requirement of rehabilitation rather than just giving the licence back.<\/p><p> The report also makes several recommendations about the organisation, administration and monitoring of penalty points systems.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, of the countries covered, Ireland is the only one with three or more agencies involved in managing penalty points.  Seven countries have two agencies, with the police doing enforcement and one other agency involved, and six countries have only one agency involved.  We should be clear.  The system must provide value for money.  It should be efficient and it should be centralised and automated.  It should not be a paper-based system.  It should be clear and simple for the public to understand.  There should be timely and easily accessible information for offenders.  For example, people should be able to look at their record online and find out where they are, when their points are coming off, where they got them and so on.  There should be regular monitoring of the system, exactly what the committee is doing today.  This is one of the few countries that has gone back and examined the system.<\/p><p> I reiterate how successful the Irish penalty points system has been.  It was brave legislation and it is paying significant dividends in terms of deaths, injuries and behaviour on our roads.  We often refer to the number of people killed and injured but we need to get better at understanding the economic and social costs of collisions.  When there is a collision on the M50, M9, M7 or M4 and the road is closed the burden that falls on industry and employers because of the resulting congestion is significant.  I hope to be able to bring forward some costings to show how many millions of euro falls on industry and individuals as a result.<\/p><p> The range of offences covered should be as broad as possible but it must be directly related to demonstrable road safety risk and propensity to involvement in collisions.  Public awareness and education is an absolute must; the system will not work without it.  If the public does not understand it and buy into it, it will not happen.<\/p><p> The measure of success for enforcement should not be the number of points issued.  It should be the number of interventions and the volume of enforcement taking place.  We need to see this on a county-by-county basis rather than rolled up on a national basis.  We need to see enforcement in every corner of the country.  Perhaps it could be a way of bringing enforcement back into rural Ireland on the back of traffic enforcement.  This could save people's lives and prevent injuries.<\/p><p> I strongly suggest or recommend that Ireland should seek to actively lead the way in Europe in getting harmonisation of penalty points throughout Europe so that we can deal with out-of-state drivers in this country, whether they are professional drivers or tourists.  We have a population of 4.4 million and there are 7 million or 8 million tourists coming to the country this year.  These people are at the same risk of being involved in a collision as our population and they should be subject to the same sanctions as our citizens.  When professional drivers and haulage operators come from other countries and operate in Ireland, they should be subject to sanction and we should have harmonisation.  We must be able to deal with out-of-state drivers.<\/p><p> I am suggesting to the committee that we should not simply increase the penalty points willy-nilly.  We should seek to reinvigorate the system to try to get further reductions in the number of deaths and injuries.  This change should be proportionate and acceptable.  It should be non-bureaucratic and accessible to the public.  It should give the maximum level of enforcement and reduce the number of cases going to court unnecessarily as well as the associated costs.<\/p><p> The insurance providers could do more to incentivise good behaviour and we need to see this reflected more in premiums for people who do not misbehave or get penalty points.  We need to disincentivise poor behaviour.  Insurance companies could support what the Oireachtas and the Garda are at and support what we are all trying to do by making motorists more aware of the implications of poor behaviour in terms of their premiums.  We need to deal with some offences that are currently outside the system, like non-display of learner plates and non-accompaniment of learner drivers.  We must deal with professional drivers' tachograph hours as well.  I thank the committee and the Chairman for the invitation and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Brett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348045200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Brett, for a comprehensive overview.

We agree that the principal focus of the system must and should continue to be to improve driver behaviour and reduce deaths and serious injury on our roads.  The human cost of collisions is incalculable and, as the Department of Transport's review points out, the financial cost to motor insurance underwriters, policyholders and the State is considerable.  It is in the national interest that we should strive to reduce these costs.<\/p><p>  Insurers, access to penalty points is an issue.  Members will be aware of the Minister's statement last year regarding allowing us access to this information.  We had been seeking this access since the then Minister, S&eacute;amus Brennan, introduced penalty points.  The Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, and the Department of Transport, specifically the national vehicle and driver file unit in Shannon, initiated discussions on the development of a real-time interface.  This involved access to and use of personal data.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was included in these discussions from the outset.<\/p><p>  An excellent tripartite relationship has been developed and I acknowledge the contributions of Gerry O&rsquo;Malley from the national vehicle and driver file unit, NVDF, of the Department and of Gary Davis from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, ODPC, for their ongoing assistance.  The focus has been on the identification of critical, relevant information that highlights risks and assists in improving road safety nationally.  I am pleased to inform the committee that we are well advanced in this project and that pilot testing should begin later this month.<\/p><p>  Members of the committee will be aware that it is essential that proposers of insurance should disclose all relevant and material information relating to their risk.  For compulsory motor insurance this includes any traffic convictions and penalty points they may have.  Insurers use this information and several other rating factors such as vehicle type, engine size and type of use, as well as the claims history and driving experience of the driver to be insured to evaluate the risk and set an appropriate premium.<\/p><p>  There are occasions when an underwriter will be given the wrong information and this may have several consequences.  The underwriter cannot evaluate the risk correctly and as a result the risk may be under-priced and consequently other policyholders have to subsidise the cost of insuring the risk.  Should the policyholder be responsible for an accident, the third party will be protected but the policyholder's damages may not be covered.<\/p><p>  Allowing underwriters to verify particulars submitted in applications for insurance cover helps to mitigate the consequences outlined above and benefits the individual policyholder in that disclosure is complete and his or her policy is valid.  It benefits underwriters in that they have appropriately priced the risk.  It benefits other policyholders in that the risk burden is appropriately shared.  It benefits the State in that the insurance system is aligned with and backs up the penalty points system, encouraging better driver behaviour and reinforcing the deterrent effect of penalty points, leading to reduced road fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.<\/p><p>  Enforcement is a key message that is being transmitted this morning and we will continue in that vein.  In our recent submissions to the Road Safety Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the development of their new strategies, we stated that the priority road traffic offences should continue to be speeding, dangerous driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, failing to wear a seat belt, using a mobile phone while driving and uninsured driving.  No amount of legislation, technological advancements or media campaigns will ever be an adequate substitute for high-level and highly visible police enforcement.  The IIF is concerned that as the deployment of resources comes under increasing pressure as a result of the pressures on State spending, the focus on road safety may become less sharp, fewer resources may be deployed and road users may revert to old and bad habits.  This point is borne out in the stalling of the reduction in road fatalities we have witnessed since the beginning of this year.  While it is true to say that the downward trend was always going to slow or bottom out at some stage, we strongly believe this has occurred sooner than it otherwise might, specifically because of a fall-off of visible enforcement action or road users' perception that less enforcement activity is taking place.  It is vital to ensure that road traffic enforcement resources are maintained or, if possible, increased and that a strong unambiguous message to this effect is constantly reinforced in road users&rsquo; minds to bolster the deterrent effect of the threat of enforcement action.<\/p><p>  Every Government-appointed international expert has advised that spending on accident prevention and safety promotion generates economic benefits associated with lower casualties which heavily outweighs the costs incurred.  Within reasonable limits, therefore, such additional spending must be seen as a particularly lucrative investment in the community and most emphatically not as merely a drain on the State's scarce resources.  Such investment would be popular with citizens, road users, workers and employers and economically advantageous to the State, if efficiently applied, through reducing demands on the health and emergency services and minimising the lost productivity associated with accidental injury and long-term injury and disability.<\/p><p>  We believe these considerations are particularly applicable to penalty points and to the use of the data supplied by insurers for use by the Garda's automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, system to detect uninsured driving.  The technology has been procured and, if applied, will increase the efficiency of resource deployment and administration many times over.  It will initially increase the number of detections and, as a consequence, act as an educator and a necessary deterrent.<\/p><p>  One crucial statistic can be taken from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's review.  According to Garda reports, in 92% of fatal collisions driver error is the main contributing factor.<\/p><p>  The use of statistics is often a crude exercise and can be used to prove or disprove almost anything.  The most obvious sign that the road safety strategy is working is the reduction in fatalities in recent years and many congratulations are due to the stakeholders, especially the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, without whom this achievement would not have been possible.<\/p> <p>The members of the IIF consider that without the support of the Garda in particular, the successes of the last road safety strategy would not have been achieved.  It is to the lasting credit of the force that it was able to support the objectives of the last strategy despite the resource constraints that have been imposed in recent years.<\/p><p> We do not have any tangible statistics on the levels of enforcement that are being used to assess the success of the current penalty points system.  Such information is needed before we can evaluate whether the penalties that are being imposed are at the appropriate level.  According to the Garda website, the number of fixed charge notices - penalty points - issued for mobile phone use when driving was 41,000 in 2008, 33,000 in 2009, 34,000 in 2010 and 33,000 in 2011.  On the basis of an extrapolation from May of this year, the 2012 figure will be 33,000.  The remarkable similarity among the figures from 2009 to 2012 could imply that the level of enforcement is consistent with no improvement in driver behaviour, or that the level of enforcement is inconsistent and a quota is being achieved.  The evidence of our own eyes - that mobile phone use when driving is endemic - cannot be disputed.  We believe the substantial increase in such behaviour over recent years is a consequence of the failure to make a determined and focused enforcement effort in this area.  This may result from the national constraint on resources, but at what human and economic cost?<\/p><p> The dramatic increase in fixed charge notices issued for speeding between 2010 and 2011 also demands some scrutiny.  Interpretations could range from a significant increase in enforcement activity to a significant deterioration in driver behaviour.  We simply do not know.  In the first instance, the members of the IIF would like to see comparative statistics using specific penalty points issued in the same area, at the same time of day, during the same time of the year, following the same number of penalty point checks carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This would give us an indication of the effectiveness of the current penalty points system and allow us to determine whether an increase in enforcement activity, or in the severity of the penalties applied, will produce safer roads for our citizens.<\/p><p> Section 3.3 of the report lists the offences for which the Department recommends a penalty point increase.  The IIF would be happy to support these recommendations subject to clarification of the current enforcement levels, as I have just described.  We firmly believe the level of Garda enforcement of such penalty point offences has not reached or come close to the point of saturation at which further increases in enforcement yield no additional benefit.  We suggest it would be premature to increase the penalties until that level is approached.  Our view is that drivers who persistently break the speed limit will not be deterred from speeding by an increase in the penalty, but will be deterred by an increase in the likelihood of being caught.  We believe it would be premature to implement any increase before completing the review of national speed limits and implementing the recommendations that arise from this review.  Our views on drink driving are similar and can be summed up by saying we believe the current blood alcohol concentration levels are appropriate but should be rigorously enforced.<\/p><p> The Irish system is compared internationally in section 4.2 of the report.  The IIF would be in favour of specific recommendations that make more efficient use of Garda time, for example by removing the requirement for a court appearance wherever possible or by establishing a traffic court in line with international best practice.  The IIF agrees with the recommendation in the report that penalty points should be aligned north and south of the Border to facilitate mutual recognition between the two jurisdictions.  We would also support consideration of the adoption of offences that are used internationally but are not currently recognised in Irish law.<\/p><p> I would like to speak briefly about uninsured driving.  I understand that legislation on statutory off-road notification is before the Government and will be enforced next year.  This will close a loophole.  We suggest that serious consideration should be given to the introduction of a system of continuous insurance enforcement, whereby the registered keeper of a vehicle that is not insured would be subject to a fine and a penalty.  That would require evidence that the vehicle is being used.  I will explain it better.  Currently, a garda must catch a person in the act of using an uninsured vehicle, as opposed to just keeping the vehicle.  It would be better to close off that loophole.  It would not add significantly to our premiums, but it would act as a deterrent and would be a way of administering it more efficiently.<\/p><p> The committee will appreciate that the operation of the penalty points system in the Courts Service is an important issue because accurate information is key to the operation of the system from the perspective of each stakeholder.  With that in mind, it is essential that penalty points awarded to drivers through the courts system, and perhaps more specifically the details of those points, are transferred efficiently and correctly to the Department of Transport's national vehicle and driver file.  If the file does not have correct and up-to-date information, then the data on it is not complete.  We understand that certain improvements have been made in this regard.  We hope this will continue.<\/p><p> The members of the IIF would like to reiterate their support for the penalty points system.  We thank the Department of Transport for their support in developing underwriters' access to this information.  This will improve the risk profile of the national motor fleet, provide a valuable service to our policyholders, enhance road safety and act as a deterrent to unsafe driving.  Additionally and perhaps most importantly, the human and financial cost of accidents will be reduced.  The review carried out by the Department is essential and should be repeated on a regular basis.  We believe the recommendations regarding penalties of increased severity are premature in advance of the provision of usable statistics on the impact of different levels of enforcement on driver behaviour.  We recommend the adoption of continuous insurance enforcement as a priority.  The Garda technological and human resources that are necessary for the ongoing operation of this system need to be allocated to ensure we maximise the benefits that our existing legal framework and technological capability permit us to achieve. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348045800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the three witnesses for their good presentations.

Their presentations will assist the committee in its deliberations on the question of how the penalty points system might be improved.  Each of the speakers accepted that the system is working well.  As a nation, we have achieved a significant reduction in the number of deaths on the roads.  We have a way to go, however.  Certain measures aimed at improving the existing system will help us in that regard.<\/p><p>  I would like to pick up on some of the points that have been made and to tease some of them out.  Reference was made to the importance of retaining penalty points as an effective means of ensuring people change their behaviour while driving, rather than involving any other extraneous issues.  I contend that there is an inherent flaw in the current system.  If somebody responds immediately to a fixed penalty notice, he or she gets two penalty points and, in the case of a speeding offence, is required to pay a fine of &euro;80.  If somebody fails to respond within the set time, for some reason, he or she has to go to court and is automatically given four penalty points.  The two-point premium that is applied in such circumstances is not linked to the person's behaviour on the road; it is linked to his or her failure to respond on time.  It is really a means of ensuring the State collects its fine.  The two-point premium is attached to the late payment rather than to the event that took place on the road.  I will argue as part of my presentation that we should change our entire way of doing business in this regard.  If someone does not respond to a fixed penalty notice within a prescribed period of time, he or she should be automatically levied with a fine and with two penalty points.  There should not be a requirement to go to court.  As a previous speaker said, there is no need to clog up the courts with this.  That would better reflect the issues that arise in this context.  Many fixed penalty notices are issued when speeding is detected by vans positioned on the side of the road.  Some of the offences in question are relatively minor by comparison with those detected by a garda on patrol.  There is work to be done in that respect.<\/p><p>  Mr. Faughnan and Mr. Brett spoke about speed limits that are poorly set.  Are they suggesting that local authorities should continue to have a role in that regard, in conjunction with local police?  Is there is a need to look at this matter in a different way?  It is clear that there are problems with it.  Anecdotal information seems to suggest that detection vans tend to be placed in grey areas.  We had understood they would be placed where accidents had taken place and where there is an historic recognition of the need for caution.  Perhaps the delegates would like to comment on that.<\/p><p>  I will ask a straight question about enforcement.  Do the witnesses think that the reduction in the size of the Garda force is having an impact on the capacity of garda&iacute; to carry out enforcement at the level that is needed?<\/p> <p> I agree with the witnesses that it is not about catching people by the collar but about having high visibility.  Even the introduction of the detection vans is about visibility because they are well marked and it is obvious their purpose is to check vehicle speeds.  The issue of mobile telephone use was covered well in the presentations.<\/p><p> Witnesses talked about past behaviour, risk and trying to reduce the number of deaths on the road.  Do the various organisations work with the statistics on accidents that actually take place?  There is a much more detailed level of accident investigation where a death occurs on the road but has any work been done on parsing the accident statistics to identify the causes of accidents?  If such data are available and could be provided to members, they would clearly indicate to us what needs to be done from a legislative perspective to further reduce the number of deaths.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses have a view on learner drivers who break the learner permit laws?  Do they believe penalty points or some other sanction should attach to those who continue to break those laws?  I am referring specifically to the requirement that a learner driver be accompanied by a full licence holder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900007#H00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348046400,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  There is a common thread running through all of the presentations even if witnesses are coming to the issues from different perspectives.  The harmonisation of sanctions is a critical issue for this country.  Witnesses referred to the 27 EU states, many of which have penalty points systems in place and it is illogical that there has not been a harmonisation of those systems across the EU.  If that were done it would sort out the 2% of drivers who are licence-swapping or points-swapping.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask Mr. Faughnan or Mr. Brett about driver testing.  Much of the practical driver test today involves testing day-to-day driving skills in a very safe environment.  However, as has been outlined, many fatal accidents are caused by dangerous over-taking but I have yet to see a learner driver being taught how to overtake safely.  It is a very important element of driving but it seems to me that learners are not taught how to do it safely.  Similarly, they are not taught about driving in hazardous conditions, such as on icy roads.  That does not form part of driver testing or driving lessons.  Until we grapple with such issues, we will continue to deal only with the day-to-day safety issues, while ignoring the more extreme driving conditions that learners may face on the roads on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  Mr. Doyle stated that 92% of fatal accidents were attributable to driver error or, at least, driver error was a contributory factor.  I presume the other 8% are attributable to poor road conditions or to issues such as livestock on roads.  With regard to the latter, there seems to be an increasing incidence of deer on roads in certain parts of the country and I know of accidents that have happened as a direct consequence.  I am specifically interested in whether road conditions are the main cause of the 8% of accidents referred to earlier.  The camber and surface of roads are important, as are inappropriate speed limits on certain roads.  The point should be pressed home to drivers that speed limits are not a target but a limit and that they should always drive at a speed suited to the conditions of the road.  What level of discussion takes place between the RSA, the NRA and the local authorities with respect to the condition of local and tertiary roads? <\/p><p>  Witnesses provided interesting statistics on the use of mobile telephones and I know that Mr. Doyle's area is statistics.  It is quite obvious the speed camera system we have will identify a licence plate, issue a photograph and the penalty points notice is probably not touched by a human hand until the driver receives it through the post.  Similarly, speed guns capture a definitive offence automatically.  However, with mobile telephone use it is the word of one person against another and if a driver disputes the matter, it could end up in court.  No member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is happy with that situation.  The driver could claim that it was a box of cigarettes, a dictaphone or some other item in his or her hand.  Until garda&iacute; have cameras on their person or in patrol cars, that difficulty will remain.  Perhaps the Garda Commissioner and superintendents need to incentivise garda&iacute; to bring more evidence-based reports to court.  We have all seen drivers using mobile telephones.  As public representatives, we drive a lot and we have all seen widespread mobile telephone use by car and truck drivers, as well as by garda&iacute;  themselves, it must be said.  It is quite right that the witnesses have highlighted this problem but the solution lies with gathering the evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900008#J00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1348046400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I urge the Deputy to ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900008#J00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1348046400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>We have seen the number of fatalities drop from a very high level in the mid-1970s to only 186 currently while the number of drivers on the roads has increased dramatically.

It has been very interesting to listen to what they had to say.  There is no doubt there has been a massive improvement in road safety.  The main point is that we must tackle the most dangerous elements of driver behaviour to further improve road safety, particularly mobile telephone use and excessively speeding.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to bad drivers and repeat offenders.  Some mechanism must be put in place to deal with such people, whether it be resitting the driver test, taking driving lessons or being educated on road usage and what they are doing wrong. <\/p><p>  The maximum number of penalty points here is 12.  Given that we are bringing much of our system in line with that in the UK, does the same maximum apply there or do the two systems differ in any major way?  Is there a problem regarding the proper identification of cars and is there a mechanism in place to deal with situations where a car is not identifiable - that is, where its number plate cannot be read?<\/p><p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has spoken about increasing the speed limit on main carriageways.  In that context, I was interested in what the witnesses had to say about the impact of even a slight change in the speed limit.  I find it infuriating, for example, when driving on dual carriageways, to find the speed limit is 80 km\/h when it should be 120 km\/h.  <\/p> <p>In the approach to a small town the speed limit is 30 km\/h.  There should be a way of penalising those who exceed the speed limit by a large amount and those who exceed the limit by a few kilometres.  When other passengers are in a car, including a baby in a seat, there must be a way of penalising reckless and dangerous driving.  Perhaps that issue needs to be teased out.  <\/p><p> I am pleased that consideration is being given to bringing the penalty points system North and South into line.  Signage is very important and there is a problem in the Border area.  I do not know the opinion of the delegates on that matter and whether issues have been raised.  There is also the problem that when people are fined they go across the Border to England, Europe or wherever and that is the end of it.  Joined-up thinking with the European Union and the UK must be promoted.  <\/p><p> I am interested in the national car test disc display.  If the NCT disc is not displayed penalty points should be imposed.  I also want to hear from the insurance industry on that issue.  The NCT does not appear to be a major issue when it comes to taking out insurance, but only when a claim is made.  When a car fails the national car test for, say, a month, how are penalty points to be imposed?  Mr. Noel Brett raised the issue of penalty points for cars dumped illegally, a point I have continued to raise for many years, but said the system must be safety-based and related to the car.  However, that would be one way of stopping the illegal dumping of cars.  I appreciate what Mr. Brett has said but it would be a deterrent.  The loss of one's driving licence or the imposition of penalty points would have the effect of cutting down on much of the illegal dumping.  I would like to hear more on that issue.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900008#J00500","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348047000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>As many of the points I wished to raise have been covered I will not repeat them.  I welcome the delegations and thank them for their presentations.  In regard to the 186 people who died on the roads last year, is there a breakdown on the numbers who died at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.?  When an accident occurs at that time there is no speed detection and it is automatically assumed it is the result of drink driving.  All the points made were sensible and reasonable but can the number of deaths be reduced further?  For example, if I am travelling home to Mayo from Dublin, a great time to drive is from 12 midnight to 2 a.m. because there is no traffic.  What is the issue?<\/p><p>  Speed detection has been changed in recent years with the introduction of speed vans and so on.  I am interested to hear the comments of the delegations on the effect of the change as their locations are predictable.  I have noticed in the past year that the Garda announce it will be in a particular area from Friday to Monday on a particular weekend.  Previously this happened only on bank holiday weekends throughout the country but now it is focused in certain places.  Is there a danger that motorists who know where and when the speed checkpoints are located will increase their speed on the way to work on a Monday when they know detection is out of the way?  Given the number of live websites, one can check before starting out on a journey if a checkpoint is on a particular road.  While I am not into technology, I wonder whether there is a possibility that people will check the speed points on their iPhones and will break the law in all directions.  I would appreciate the comments of the delegation on those issues.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900009#K00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1348047000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I take on board all the points made, which are extremely sensible.  A particular hobbyhorse of mine is the driving test.  One day a person is a learner driver with L plates displayed.  He or she sits the driving test and can drive on the motorways as if he or she had years of experience of motorway driving.  The television advertisements are very effective and, perhaps, something can be done on how we drive on the motorways.  Motorway driving is new to us and we are only getting used to it.  On the Continent there appears to be a set of rules when coming on to a motorway, stipulating that the driver in the closest lane should automatically pull out into the outside lane to allow one come safely in.  That does not always happen here and perhaps it could be included in the television advertisements in the future.<\/p><p>  The GPS provides information on one's speed and the location of speed cameras.  That is good because one will automatically check one's speed to ensure one is driving within the speed limit.<\/p><p>  I refer to the statistics and data on the 92% of fatal collisions.  When referring to acceptance of the penalty points system the statistics were broken down as between males and females but not for the fatal collisions.  I am the only female member on the committee.  Do the statistics show that women have a tendency to drive more safely?  I would like that statistic broken down into gender and age as it could have an effect on insurance and how we attest to the safety of drivers on the roads.

It was not today or yesterday that Mr. Conor Faughnan started to address this issue.  I thank Mr. Noel Brett for his presentation and the invitation to visit the Road Safety Authority in Ballina.  On page 3 of his presentation he stated that Sweden is the safest place but according to page 11 it does not have GPS.  How is it that Sweden got to be the safest place by doing things differently?  Would its experience be of value to us?<\/p><p>  In the first six months of the year there was an increase in the number of road deaths.  We raised the issue with the Leader in the Seanad and he was to contact the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p> <p>I was seriously concerned that the improvements made over 20 to 25 years had been reversed.  It seems that the number has flattened again, so were July and August particularly good?  It is important for us to know the up-to-date figure for 2012.  We can take laps of honour for the great improvement made previously but I am concerned that a very good trend has been reversed.  <\/p><p> Deputy Dooley made a point about learner drivers.  I think they give a \"Harvey Smith\" sign to everybody when they drive on motorways.  As one enters a motorway a sign will state \"no L drivers\".  Such drivers are nearly as dangerous as people who use their mobile phones while driving.  Why are there no penalty points for such a blatant breach of the law?  When we discussed the latest full-year data in the Seanad we found that the counties of Donegal and Cavan had road deaths that were out of proportion with their populations.  We wondered, as Deputy Ellis suggested, whether two links could be made between the PSNI and the Garda in Derry and Donegal and Fermanagh and Cavan.  There is evidence of a bad safety record in at least two of the Border counties.<\/p><p> Another issue that I wish to raise is vehicle immobilisation.  Paddy Matthews owns a bus company in Inniskeen, County Monaghan, and he has fitted an alcohol-activated vehicle immobiliser in his fleet of buses.  Now there is no danger of an incompetent or incapable driver driving his buses. Some 10% of the population still do not wear seatbelts.  It has proven difficult to increase the 90% usage figure.  Should we enforce usage measures?  Could we introduce systems to prevent drink driving and insist on seatbelt usage?  Vehicle immobilisation systems can recognise unusual obstacles and ensures that vehicles will stop if another vehicle, tree or pole blocks its path.  It is well worth considering importing some of that technology from countries where cars and motor vehicles are made as we try to move on to the next stage of road safety.   <\/p><p> I wish to ask our visitors about drugs and driving again.  How good is the drug detection system?  I thank the delegations and I hope that we will continue this dialogue.  I hope that the number of road death fatalities did not change for the worse in the first six months of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900009#K00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348047600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I congratulate the speakers on their informative contributions.  I have a question on whether a 60 km\/h zone should follow a 100 km\/h zone.  Awarding two penalty points to a driver caught doing 67 km\/h in a 60 km\/h zone is harsh.  Is a different view taken of someone doing 70 km\/h and someone doing 65 km\/h?  Driving 7 km\/h over a speed limit is the equivalent to driving 4.5 km\/h too fast and it is a bit harsh to award two penalty points for such a breach.<\/p><p>  I have a question on litter offences.  Mr. Faughnan said that litter has nothing to do with road safety but I have an issue with this.  I am trying to catch somebody who slows down their car in a 40 km\/h zone to drop a bag of ashes and a bag of household refuse on a public road in the middle of a nice town, where it remains.  It poses a danger to oncoming traffic and drivers must try to avoid it.  I have seen other instances of this and witnessed such offences.  If I catch the owner of the car I would like to think that he or she would receive penalty points on their licence and I support Deputy Ellis's view on the matter.  <\/p><p>  I have a question on the nationwide review of all speed limits, particularly in rural areas where none seem to exist or there is no indication of same but a maximum 80 km\/h speed limit applies.  There are 800 miles of road in my county and 8% of them have an 80 km\/h speed limit.  It should be halved and I should have brought photographs with me to prove my point.  Its not good enough to have a <i>carte blanche<\/i> 80 km\/h limit when the roads are not fit for Stirling Moss, Michael Schumacher or any Formula 1 driver to drive on.  They simply could not do such speed on the roads.  I ask for a more realistic speed limit to be applied.  <\/p><p>  There was a question and comment on mobile telephone usage.  Practically all drivers have a mobile telephone of which many can be fixed in their cars.  It is a distraction to receive or answer a call while driving.

There have been a lot of recurring themes and one was the setting of speed limits, which is of massive importance.  Senator Terry Brennan mentioned it and so did many others.  It is evident that many speed limits are ridiculous and there is a back story behind many.  I got soaked in the subject when metrication was introduced a number of years ago.  There is a history behind the 80 km\/h default speed limit that has appeared on local authority roads.  As the Senator has said, Michael Schumacher physically could not drive at that speed.  Every time one sees the speed limit it undermines credibility and respect for the system.  It is a glaring omission.<\/p><p>  One of problems is that individual local authorities have the power to set the speed limit in their areas.  I got into slightly hot water for suggesting that the power should be taken from them.  They have had it since 1994.  I know there is a philosophy of trying to democratically devolve decisions as close to the affected citizens as possible.  I favour such a move in principle but in practical effect each local authority - even well-meaning - tends to apply its own version of the guidelines and criteria.  A driver can cross county boundaries and discover that rules have been changed.  The N4 leaving Dublin is four lanes wide and is a brand new modern highway with a central concrete barrier which means that there are no crossover accidents but an 80 km\/h speed limit is applied.  The same road <i>en route<\/i> to Roscommon has a single lane boreen lined with white crosses with a 100 km\/h speed limit. <\/p> <p>We have to get those correct, certainly before we make the punishments for speeding more substantive.  We have raised this already and we got good support from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Department.  There is a review under way as we speak.  It is a big issue but parallel work has been going on about it.<\/p><p> On whether the detection bands are in the correct locations, the motoring representative group says they are, despite the fact that I get regular complaints from motorists about it.  The locations are picked fairly.  They are based on the collision data for the past five years, so wherever speed caused a collision that is the criterion that is used to decide where the vans go.  That data set is renewed but it has not been done yet.  It should be renewed every year.  It is due to be renewed this year.  At any given time the cameras are located in places where over the past five years a disproportionate number of speeding collisions have occurred.  It was always policy to signpost them and publish them on the Garda website.  The intention is to be upfront and to communicate properly.  The AA believes it is a good system.  One gets the odd wrinkle or imperfection.  We occasionally have to go to people such as Con O'Donoghue in the Garda with individual complaints we have had but, by and large, it works reasonably well.  We do get some complaints about it but on the whole it works reasonably well.  A key virtue of this, at least in theory, is that in doing the easy job in those known locations, the Go Safe fleet performs its own function but also frees up Garda time, so one should in theory see more garda&iacute; out and about at other locations because the bread and butter work of policing the blackspots has been outsourced to Go Safe.  In theory it works very well while in practice it works reasonably well, although it obviously needs scrutiny and constant monitoring.<\/p><p> Deputies Harrington, Ellis and others spoke about the importance of harmonisation across the EU.  That is clearly important.  The first priority for us is to harmonise with Northern Ireland and then the United Kingdom.  There are different systems in many other European countries but to be honest, other than professional drivers, most of the traffic we have is cross-Border traffic on the island, or British people here and Irish people in the United Kingdom.  That is the most common.  We have to get that sorted out.  We are not the cause of the delay.  It is our friends in the United Kingdom.  I do not wish to bash them because they are world leaders in road safety in many ways but they have not yet co-ordinated their own penalty points system properly.  There is not, as yet, proper recognition of Northern Irish penalty points in Great Britain, let alone harmonisation across an international frontier.  It is a priority for both jurisdictions, in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We should go ahead on the island first and then have harmonisation with Great Britain and eventually have harmonisation across Europe.  If we wait for a pan-European solution we would be waiting a long time before it came about.<\/p><p> There were some queries about accidents that are not the fault of the driver.  In a lot of cases it is the road condition.  Good analysis has been done on that.  If anyone in the committee is interested in further reading I would recommend the European road assessment programme, EuroRAP, which can be accessed at <i>eurorap.org<\/i>.  Very good analysis has been done on that, including an Irish report to which the NRA contributed along with RoadsNI.<\/p><p> I wish to pick through some of the other issues which are close to my heart, such as whether we are educating young drivers properly.  Mr. Brett's team is involved in that area so he will probably address the issue more comprehensively than I can.  The entire system for teaching and testing drivers has been overhauled.  It has been dramatically improved from where it used to be.  There used to be a one-year wait for a driving test but that is gone now.  There has been a good reform lesson there.  It is still imperfect, and there are still unacceptable wrinkles in the system - for example, whether one is likely to pass the test is materially affected by which test centre one attends, which should not be the case.  There are still some concerns around the standards of driver training.  There has been difficulty in getting some of the existing cohort of driving instructors up to an acceptable professional standard.  The job of work is not complete but it is much better than it used to be.  Previously, one went to an amateur driving instructor and did whatever one wanted.  The State did not care.  The State only looked at one for 20 minutes, which was the duration of a driving test, during which one never faced real road conditions - one never went to the motorway, drove at night or faced bad weather.  If one could do that and behave oneself one went in an instant from being a learner driver to a seasoned, professional mature driver with a licence that would last a lifetime, provided one renewed it every ten years.  That is much better now.  There is essential basic training, teaching people in modules, looking at things such as motorway driving.  It is much better than it used to be.<\/p><p> The final point has been made several times.  I understand the problem of fly-tipping and, even more sinister, systematic illegal dumping.  A major problem is the illegal dumping of the by-product of fuel laundering, which is a persistent organised crime problem.  It is something of an unfair stereotype to say it is confined to Border counties but there is a pocket of activity in Border counties.  I am in favour of anything to get those evil so-and-sos.  They got Al Capone on tax evasion.  I would be glad to see the Government do whatever it can to get these guys.  There is a &#8220;but&#8221;, however.  Smoking is ruinous to one's health.  There is no doubt about it.  Smoking in a car is probably worse.  If one is fumbling with a cigarette box, for example, while driving a car, or if one slows down on a main road to tip out one's ashtray, that is already covered under existing road traffic law.  It is an offence to drive a vehicle without due care and attention.  The law cannot write down shavers, CD players, lipstick or hairbrushes, or all of the witless things that a driver might conceivably do, so there is a catch-all clause in the legislation.  If one's driving is dangerous because one is doing something stupid then the law can prosecute one for that perfectly adequately under existing legislation, whether the stupid thing one is doing is littering or smoking.  I would oppose the misuse of road safety legislation to prosecute other things just because the road safety legislation is the bit that works.  If we want to stop people smoking in cars that is a public health issue, not a road safety issue.  I do not think one can co-opt road safety law to do that.  Not a single person in this room or probably in the country would defend illegal dumping out of cars but if we have a problem with that it is the dumping law that must be strengthened.  It would be a major strategic mistake in the long term to co-opt an effective piece of road safety legislation and to bolt all sorts of other things on to it, whether desirable or undesirable.  There is probably no better mechanism that I can think of to persuade people to pay the household charge but it has nothing to do with road safety.  <\/p><p> If one starts to use the penalty points system for other social issues of that nature, one will have two effects.  The first is that it will cease to be of any use to the insurance industry in terms of measuring risk and, second, one will lose the support of the motoring population who have bought into road safety policies and have changed.  The group most entitled to credit for the improvement in road safety is the Irish motorist.  Irish drivers have bought into road safety policies.  The drink driving limit was reduced in 1994 from 100 mg to 80 mg.  It was hugely controversial at the time and lots of people resisted it.  Last year it was reduced from 80 mg to 50 mg amid universal public acclaim.  That tells one the sea change in public attitudes that has taken place towards road safety in the past ten to 15 years.  That has been underscored by sound policies that have concentrated on road safety and have brought the public with them.  If we start to misuse road safety law just because it is effective in order to police the topical issue of the day it would probably work for smoking or for dumping but it would be a long-term strategic mistake in terms of road safety law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900010#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348048200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I will try to go through the questions but not in great detail as many of them have been covered.  I agree with Deputy Dooley that we should take every opportunity we can to prevent cases going to court unless a motorist insists on a day in court.  These cases should not be clogging up the court as they incur huge costs and are a crazy waste of Garda time while they wait around courts.  When cases are adjourned then garda&iacute; return to deal with cases on overtime.  We need the Garda to do enforcement.  If a motorist wants a day in court he or she has the right as a citizen.  However, we should use every mechanism available to deal with such cases.  In reviewing the penalty points system, if there is a mechanism that can stop the people who put their notice behind the clock and forget to pay it from having to go to court, if they do not want to go, then I would applaud that.  It would deliver savings both in the courts system and in Garda enforcement.  We need every available garda to be involved in enforcement on the road and not to be tied up in court.  Neither the garda nor the driver wants to be in court and the judge does not need them there.  The driver has made a mistake and he or she wants to correct it.<\/p><p>  In terms of speed limits, there are two actions in the current road safety strategy. One was for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to set new engineering guidelines for the entire country.  That has been done.  Every local authority is now reviewing its speed limits.  There is an issue with which we must grapple in terms of consistency, on which Mr. Faughnan touched, namely, that even within a county one can get different interpretations of the guidelines within different engineering areas.<\/p> <p>Guidelines need to be implemented universally and drivers need to be able to know from the road, almost intuitively, what speed they should be doing.  They should not be looking around for the limits.  The limit of 80 km\/h on a boreen or bog road that has rushes growing in the middle is considered the default limit at present.  I understand the Department has some proposals to reduce that but it is also in the gift of every local authority to set its own limits for those roads, which needs to happen.  It is a very cumbersome process for elected members, a reserved function that takes ages, so we need to do something nationally in terms of fairness and consistency.  Every one of us, as a driver, should know intuitively, just by looking around us at the road type and layout and what is happening in regard to pedestrians and traffic volume, what speed we should be doing.  Speed limits should be there just as a reminder.  I agree with the speaker on that.<\/p><p> I refer to the placement of the GoSafe, privately operated camera vans run by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These do 6,000 hours of filming per month and are paid only for that.  They are not paid for whomever they catch or do not catch.  Approximately 53% of their hours are during evenings and at weekends, to reflect when fatal and serious injuries caused by speed-related collisions take place.  The vans have been a fantastic success story.  Members may wish to consider inviting the Garda Commissioner to tell them about it in terms of the savings they have made and how they have reduced collisions on our most dangerous routes.  This work has freed up a tremendous amount of Garda enforcement - some 6,000 hours.  We need to see that enforcement in place, not instead of Garda involvement but as an addition to it.  It is a fantastic story and a credit to garda&iacute; in the way they have operated it.  It enjoys very strong public support.  We are now in a situation where local representatives are writing to us, saying there is an issue in their community and they want one of these vans.  That is an example of how local representatives are realising this is a solution for their parts of the country.  I have had probably three or four letters from public representatives asking for vans to be moved but, in general, people want them in their communities and realise they add considerable value.  It is a good success story.<\/p><p> With regard to collision analysis,  I will send this information to the clerk of the committee.  Every year we publish road collision data and we are about to publish for 2011.  It is based on the report we get from the Garda in regard to every collision.  Last year we received 29,400 forms, all of which were analysed.  If members are interested in their local areas they can access our website, which has a section on collision statistics where it is possible to select and check any section of road in the country and analyse the collisions that have happened in recent years and their types.  That is of great use to people in their own communities.  <\/p><p> Deputy Dooley asked about learner drivers who do not display \"L\" plates or who do not have accompaniment.  My view is there should be two penalty points for each offence and this should be enforced.  Forcing these drivers into court is not the right way; there should be an automatic awarding of two points, irrespective of age.  It is to do with experience.  Such a driver is in a learning period and is a novice.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Harrington, I would echo what Mr. Faughnan said.  We must harmonise with Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Ireland is in a good place now to lobby for harmonisation and lead on this in Europe.  It may take decades but if one does not start one will never do it.  I am particularly concerned about the number of tourists and foreign drivers who come into this country.  They must be subject to the same rules as our own drivers.<\/p><p> I refer to driver testing and training.  Anybody who is learning to drive now has compulsory lessons and a syllabus.  There are 1,900 approved driving instructors operating around the country, all of whom have a FETAC level 6 qualification.  The syllabus includes the types of issues the Deputy referred to.  That is the new cohort of drivers.  The vast bulk of drivers, including myself, have never had this training - that is an issue.  Mr. Faughnan spoke about the changes that have happened in driver testing and training.  We are on a journey here.  A lot has been done but further changes and reforms remain to take place.  I would disagree with Mr. Faughnan's view that the test centre in which one takes the test dictates the outcome.  A range of factors dictate this.  There are economic factors - whether one has access to a vehicle in order to practise, whether one has taken tuition, the quality of same, etc.  There may be literacy and socioeconomic issues.  For example, I refer to the driver theory test.  Every candidate gets the same book, learns the same questions and goes and sits in front of a computer.  No other individual is involved.  The questions are put at random in front of the candidate who touches the screen to respond.  There is a 34% difference between the centres with the highest and lowest pass rates yet no other person is involved.  The testing in this country compares remarkably to the high-end of testing outcomes in Europe.  I would disagree, therefore, that the result is down to location.  Our service is accredited.  It is a constant battle to keep consistency of testing.  Ours is one of the only testing regimes that publishes its outcomes by test centre, by theory test centre and by NCT test centre.  That is the kind of openness we need.  People need to see that.  However, there are many complex factors involved given that the theory test shows that everybody is on the same field.  The more information we can provide in terms of consistency the better.  I accept there is a continuous battle in any testing regime, across any sector, to ensure that the right person gets the right result all of the time.  It is always a challenge.<\/p><p> Deputy Harrington made some comments on mobile telephone use.  This is notoriously difficult to detect.  One has to actually see the person and catch him or her in the act.  It would be a natural extension of the safety camera and the Garda ANPR systems to start capturing footage in regard to mobile telephone usage and use it as good strong evidence.  There is also a requirement to change legislation so that in any fatal or serious injury collision it should be normal investigative practice that both drivers' mobile telephone records are sought.  As I understand it, at present one must deal with the Wireless Telegraphy Act, which is very dated.  There are many issues around privacy and all of that.  However, where a citizen has been killed on our roads, or has had a life-altering injury, I believe it is proportionate that both drivers' mobile telephone records should routinely be requested and checked.  If there was mobile telephone use at the time of collision that should be a very significant part in the prosecution.  If such legislation were in place and was the practice, coupled with the penalty point system, we would see a marked change in what is now perhaps the most dangerous behaviour on the road, the one that, as Mr. Faughnan's survey shows, irritates the most motorists.  It irritates all of us because we are sharing the road with somebody who is not sharing it fairly.  I agree with the Deputy as to the quality of evidence.<\/p><p> I refer to adverse conditions such as motorway and night-time driving.  There are proposals with the Minister in terms of graduated licensing to the effect that after a person passes the driving test during the following three months he or she would have to take additional tuition with an approved instructor in order to be fit for motorways and night-time driving.  There are issues when this happens with novice drivers.  In parts of the country, for example, there is no access to a motorway and very inexperienced drivers would have to travel long distances.  Night-time driving is easy to do in the winter but harder to do in the summer.  We believe it would be much more effective that a person who has mastered the basics and passed a basic driving test would be required to take some very targeted tuition with an approved instructor, going out on the motorway or dual carriageway, doing some night-time driving, and practising and logging these hours.  That would be a more effective way to do it when a person is at this stage in his or her driving career.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis raised a broad range of issues, some of which I have covered.  I agree with him about a mechanism to re-educate bad drivers.  The threat of having to re-sit one's driving test would probably focus the mind of every one of us in the room, more than a fine would.  That mechanism should be there for the most serious offenders.  <\/p><p> At present the maximum number of points awarded in Ireland is 12; in the UK it is ten.  The systems are not harmonised as they need to be.  Mr. Faughnan touched very well on that point.  <\/p><p> I refer to the identification of number plates.  Somebody may have a defective plate or may have deliberately altered the plate so that it cannot be detected, not only in road traffic situations but for other crimes.  As of now, a garda has to detect that, issue a summons, take the person to court, stand up in court and deal with that situation.  The court should not have to deal with this.  It is an ideal offence for penalty points, one that is directly related to road safety and road use behaviour.  I concur with the Deputy in that regard.<\/p><p> We have covered speed limits.  Consistency is the big issue here.  I would make the point a couple of members have made - when people start talking about being \"only a small bit above\" the limit we should remember that it is the location in which the offence takes place that counts.  Exceeding a speed limit by 7 km or 8 km in a zone with limits of 30 km\/h, 40 km\/h, 50km\/h or 60 km\/h, where there are pedestrians and children, can mean one is 10% or 15% in excess.  It is about the risk, not about how many kilometres per hour one is in excess.  It is about the location where the offence takes place and what that means in terms of risk.  There is scope to look, in due course, when the speed limits are sorted out, at some kind of calibrated system that penalises excess.  However, we need to relate that to the environment in which the excess happens.  For example, a person driving at 67 km\/h in a school zone is of much more concern to me than somebody driving at 140 km\/h on a motorway.<\/p> <p>It is just a matter of identifying the context in which offences are taking place and then trying to deal with that.<\/p><p> All European jurisdictions have different signage.  I would love to see the introduction of a European project to establish core signage.  I refer here to key safety signs, such as stop signs, junction signs, etc.  It would be great to establish the same signage across Europe, particularly in view of the fact that the populations of the various countries are highly mobile.  Irish people visit other member states and citizens from the latter travel here.  I am of the view, therefore, that there is much more to be done in the context of this matter.<\/p><p> Reference was made to motorists displaying NCT certificates on their vehicles and to more general issues relating to the test.  I cannot overemphasise the importance of the NCT as a road safety measure.  When it was first launched in 1999-2000, fewer than 8% of cars passed the test at the first attempt.  We all remember what the vehicle fleet on our roads was like at that stage.  At present, some 54% of vehicles pass the NCT at the first attempt.  We have a fantastic fleet but it is ageing.  The current age of vehicles in the fleet is eight years and we are in a dangerous place in this regard.  People are making decisions with regard to whether they should pay their mortgages, feed their kids, pay a particular bill or service their cars.  Each month some 400 vehicles which are subjected to the NCT are given what is called a \"fail dangerous\" notice.  Such vehicles are absolutely unsafe to leave the test centre and must be taken away on recovery trucks.  There are very serious road safety issues with regard to these vehicles, and their owners would have driven them to the test centres in that condition.  The condition of the fleet is critical.  There is a need to ensure that people have their cars tested and, as a result, the NCT is linked to drivers' insurance and motor tax.<\/p><p> In recent years I have noticed that a large number of vehicles are failing the NCT as a result of the state of their tyres, suspensions and various components.  People are just not servicing their cars because they do not have the cash to do so.  That is a major issue.  As a result of this, a greater proportion of fatalities and injuries on our roads are going to come about on foot of the condition of the vehicles in our fleet.  We have made huge leaps forward in the context of the condition of the fleet.  We must ensure that our progress in this regard continues by incentivising people.<\/p><p> As Mr. Faughnan stated, we need to tackle illegal dumping and similar issues in the arenas in which they are taking place.  For example, dumping is a reprehensible crime and those who engage in it need to be hit hard.  In that context, I am concerned that penalty points would be seen as an immediate but lesser solution.  Dumping is such a serious offence that it must be dealt with at source by means of the correct legislation.  There is strong evidence from research carried out at European level that one makes a long-term mistake if one tries to use road safety legislation to tackle other matters.  There is a need to keep the punishment relevant for people.  I agree that this is an issue of major importance.

In the coming weeks we will be publishing a breakdown in respect of each of these.  I will ensure that the Deputy and the Chairman receive copies of the relevant information.<\/p><p>  On speed enforcement, I welcome the use of websites and other mechanisms.  We want people to change their behaviour rather than be caught.  I return to the point I made in my submission with regard to the need to get people to comply.  Safety cameras have been exceptionally successful and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to be congratulated in that regard.  However, it is time that the zones were updated.  A discussion needs to take place - perhaps at this committee - in respect of how much of the activity relating to speed enforcement should be covert in nature and how much should be overt.  At some point we need to start moving the vans around such that the locations in which 80% of them are to be found will be publicised while information relating to the other 20% will not.  This is a very sensitive matter, particularly in the context of how action is calibrated.  There is a need to do as I have suggested, however, because it ties in with deterrence.<\/p><p>  Ireland is unique within Europe in the context of the level of public support for penalty points and speed enforcement.  This is because people understand what is involved and are in favour of existing activity being expanded even further.  Localised campaigns, such as Operation Focus, run by the Garda are welcome but these are no substitute for day-to-day routine enforcement, particularly in rural areas.  It is important that the enforcement effort should reflect what is happening on the roads in the context of the number of vehicles that are in operation and the number of collisions that occur.  We must ensure that enforcement does not just take place in urban areas.  It must happen across the entire country.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan referred to driver manners, driver arrogance and basic behaviour on the roads.  This matter is addressed in the context of graduated driver licensing in respect of our motorways, etc.  At present, the RSA has a number of campaigns running on television and the Internet and in cinemas on the subject of merging into traffic and overtaking on motorways.  The Irish population did not grow up with motorways and its members are really struggling to understand them.  Roundabouts are another huge issue.  The number of people who drive the wrong way around a roundabout is unbelievable.  Those to whom I refer are all holders of Irish driving licences.  We are trying to push hard in respect of these matters and it is for this reason we need the penalty points regime to reinforce that education and awareness.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct in respect of satellite navigation and warning systems.  Anything that helps one to moderate one's driving, behave safely and not be detected is a good outcome for Ireland and for drivers in general.  In addition, such systems are cost-effective and I am happy with that aspect.<\/p><p>  All of the data relating to gender and age can be found on our website.  Nine out of ten fatalities are male.  This is predominantly a male issue and members can see a breakdown in respect of it on the website.  I will certainly forward the collision data to the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Senator Barrett asked a number of questions about Sweden.  The latter currently does not have a demerit system.  Sweden is 30 years ahead of us.  It has a particular culture with regard to vehicles, roads, etc.  What we are trying to do is accomplish in ten years what it took the Swedish 30 years to achieve.  We are doing this by learning from them.  The Senator will be interested to note that Sweden lost its first place in Europe last year, when it was overtaken by the UK.  Ireland is in fifth place while Sweden is now in second.  There are major issues in Sweden, one of which relates to traffic policing.  The job is never done and once one takes one's foot off the gas - I hope members will pardon the pun - bad behaviour returns very quickly.  It is much more difficult to change people's behaviour the second time.  There has been a major change in this country in recent years in the context of drink driving.  People here no longer offer others alcohol if they call to their homes and are driving.  It is fine to say \"I am driving\".<\/p><p>  If we do not continue to enforce the law, people will come to realise that this is the case.  When, a number of years from now, we return to this matter and try to spend the amount of money required in order to change their behaviour again, they will not accept the message as easily.  One only gets one chance in respect of this matter.  It is critical, therefore, that we maintain the level of enforcement.  The issue of learner drivers using motorways is one which is ripe for enforcement and the imposition of penalty points.  Such drivers should not be on our motorways.  Some 45 holders of learner permits were killed in collisions last year and a further 75 suffered serious injuries.  These are not the only people at risk on the roads but a particular type of intervention is required in respect of them.<\/p><p>  Senator Barrett raised a number of issues in the context of vehicle technology, including \"alcolocks\", vehicle inhibitors, speed limiters and so on.  Representatives from the RSA and other agencies are currently involved in examining the position with regard to these devices.  In the context of the forthcoming budget, I wish to point out that there is an unusual situation in Ireland in that proven safety features attract the highest rate of VAT and they also attract VRT.  In a way, we are almost disincentivising people from using the devices to which I refer.  If a person is buying a fleet of vans and if he or she chooses to opt in for some proven safety features such as \"lane assist\", alcolocks, etc., not only will the base price increase but he or she will also be charged VAT and VRT.  We are, therefore, disincentivising fleet buyers and private motorists from choosing the safest vehicles.<\/p><p>  Another example in this regard relates to motorcyclists.  We want motorcyclists to wear the best possible quality of safety helmets.  In Ireland, however, such helmets attract the highest rate of VAT.  I need motorcyclists to wear proper leathers, back protectors, spine protectors, gauntlets and boots but all of this equipment attracts the highest rate of VAT.  In the UK, it is zero-rated.  As a result, people in Ireland purchase cheaper gear or they buy it on the Internet.  They do not know the quality of the latter and whether it will fit them.  We do not have a home-grown industry selling that material.  There is a strong opportunity to achieve a huge road safety dividend by encouraging people to purchase the safest vehicles and use the type of technology to which the Senator refers.  The same applies in respect of motorcyclists and pedal cyclists.  The latter should be able to obtain the type of protective equipment to which I refer, particular as it can save lives or prevent injury.<\/p><p>  A great deal needs to happen in respect of drug driving.  Three issues arise in this context: illegal drugs, over-the-counter medicines and prescription medicines.  We must not try to use road traffic legislation to deal with illegal drug use.  However, we must deal with impairment.  As I understand it, the forthcoming Bill will contain a number of provisions in this regard.<\/p><p>  My take on smoking in vehicles is that it is a public health issue.  If there are children in the vehicle, then it is also a child protection issue.  The notion that one would fill a small space in which children are to be found with a toxic substance  is unbelievable.  I am of the view that if this matter is to be tackled in a robust manner, then it must be dealt with in the realms of child protection and public health.  Obliging garda&iacute; to stop people who are smoking in their cars and give them two penalty points will not change their behaviour; rather, it will make them frustrated.  There is a need for some very robust legislation in this area.  Mr. Faughnan referred to people driving with due care and attention.<\/p> <p>A similar scenario is where a motorist leaves a drive-through takeaway with a burger and a drink on his or her lap.  There is legislation to deal with those issues, and that is how we should deal with the smoking issue.<\/p><p> Senator Terry Brennan raised several issues in regard to speed, and we have touched on some of those.  He also spoke at length about motorists using mobile telephones while driving.  We have covered that issue.<\/p><p> Senator Sean Barrett and Deputy John O'Mahony both asked about the future and where we hope to go from here.  The table on page 5 of my submission sets out the fatality data.  As members will see, we were going very well this year until June, when there were 25 fatalities.  That came out of nowhere and I cannot say what caused it.  It might simply be a statistical variation or a function of behaviour or enforcement practice.  It is my view that we will not see a continuation of the downward trend in fatalities for seven years in a row.  Instead, I expect there will be an increase this year and subsequent increases in 2013 and 2014.  The graph on page 2 shows the level of fatalities has gone up and down in the past.  Without a genuine reinvigoration of the efforts that have been made in the past six or seven years, we are on the cusp of an increase and it will be much harder to push the rate down the next time.  The major risk in this regard is complacency, including both public and political complacency.  The single most important action that must be taken is to reinvigorate efforts to address the issue, as the committee is doing today.  We must persist in our endeavours to increase awareness among the public. Above all, we must ensure that enforcement remains a priority.  If efforts on that end fall away, I absolutely guarantee that this graph will be back above 250 within two to three years.  That is a natural consequence of human nature and human behaviour.  History shows that a major intervention, such as the introduction of penalty points in 2002, will lead to a massive reduction in fatalities.  However, if the enforcement aspect is allowed to falter, a rise in the death toll is inevitable.  That is the most important message I would leave with members.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Mahony asked about the days of the week when accidents are most likely to occur.  There is a perception that most fatal road accidents occur in the early hours of the morning, but that is not the case.  So far this year, the most dangerous time on the roads has been 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., with 25 fatalities occurring at that time.  The table on page 5 shows the days of the week and the times at which all accidents occurred.  Saturday and Sunday remain the most dangerous days, and the data in this regard are in line with the view that one is most likely to die in a road accident late at night.  Across all days, however, the most dangerous time is the afternoon and evening.  We are now heading into the most dangerous time of year when the clocks go back and the weather deteriorates.  The rate of road fatalities will resume an upward trend.  My colleagues in the various organisations and I are struggling to keep the numbers down but without interventions, an increase is unavoidable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900013#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Brett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348050000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Doyle to respond, although a great deal has already been covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900014#P00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348050000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Mr. Brett likes to steal my thunder.<\/p><p>  I absolutely endorse the proposal regarding a centralised system for speed limits, which makes total sense.  However, we should never forget that no matter how poor the road conditions, one must always drive in accordance with those conditions.  To drive in any other fashion makes one an uneducated road user.  Blaming the condition of the roads or trees falling on roads is not convincing; motorists should be prepared for all such eventualities.<\/p><p>  That leads to another point which I do not think has been mentioned.  Of course there are penalty points and there are all sorts of things going on with regard to driving on motorways and various other things, but we must keep advertising and we must keep educating.  Therefore, there is a question of funding.  I am sure Mr. Brett would agree with me that providing funding for advertising in this regard will result in the population being educated.  One needs to know how to drive safely.  If one cannot get to a motorway, one still sees the ads, which are good.  However, these have to be funded; therefore, funding for the RSA, which runs them, needs to be kept up.  Otherwise, awareness will come down.<\/p><p>  The statistics I referred to, including the figure of 92% in regard to driver error, are not mine but come from the report of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The data on mobile telephone use are from the website of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When I was examining the information on mobile telephone catches on the website, there was significant coherence in terms of the numbers.  I would argue strongly that this is not because it is a persistent problem that will not go away.  We all know that, and something must be done about it.<\/p><p>  I cannot but reinforce the message Mr. Brett has given in regard to Garda enforcement.  I am confident that we can achieve a reduction in the annual number of road fatalities from 186.  We can and should be best in the class.  The great thing about Ireland is that we are a small country which can get stuff done nationally.  The speed camera programme, for which I and others campaigned long and hard, is a wonderful initiative, but it is not a reason - and we were told it would not be a reason - for the Garda to step down its enforcement activities.  Unfortunately, all of the evidence suggests that because of resource constraints, that is precisely what is happening.  If that trend continues, I agree with Mr. Brett that fatalities will rise, we will be wondering what happened and the blame game will begin.  On the question of increasing penalties, my view is that we should concentrate on enforcing a consistent application of existing penalties before considering any changes in that regard.<\/p><p>  Insurance premiums peaked some ten years ago and have since declined by 26%.  As it stands, they are half the price of premiums in the United Kingdom.  We are doing quite well on the premium front.  When I joined the IIF ten years ago, prices were insane but we were making a loss on our motor book.  Today motor insurance companies are making a profit on their motor books, which will please the shareholders and pensioners, but it is not a significant amount.  As I said, prices here are, on average, half the equivalent United Kingdom rate.  We are doing well in that space, but I am sure there are individual cases which go against the grain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900014#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1348050000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Doyle provide those figures to the committee?

Women are better drivers than men and live longer than men, but we will no longer be able to factor that into our risk assessments.  We must follow the law and do our best to use other risk-rating factors to ensure we are appropriately applying risk.  That is why immediate and accurate access to penalty points data is vital if we are to identify safe and unsafe drivers so that the former can be offered competitive premiums and the risks can be accurately reflected in the prices offered to the latter.<\/p><p>  In regard to the NCT, we are under some difficulty in terms of accessing data.  We are hopeful that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will grant us official access to vehicles' NCT status and information on driver disqualifications, but there is no provision for that in the legislation.  We urge that this be done in the next road traffic Bill.  We would not be prepared to underwrite a vehicle that has not passed the NCT and there is an implication for the risk assessment of a driver who has a previous disqualification.  We must have access to that information if our assessments are to be accurate.<\/p><p>  I will conclude by reiterating the message regarding enforcement.  It is only by maintaining and enhancing enforcement efforts that we will build on the great national achievement of reducing deaths on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900014#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1348050000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Faughnan to respond to any outstanding points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900014#P00600","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348050000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>On the question of the cost of insurance in this country compared with the United Kingdom, we can see the Irish tendency to bash ourselves.  In fact, we are miles ahead of Britain in terms of motor and other liability insurance.  Ten years ago insurance premiums were double the price of those in the United Kingdom, but now they are only 50% of the UK average price.  That reduction is a consequence of the work done by people such as Dorothea Dowling and her colleagues at the Injuries Board.  The United Kingdom, on the other hand, is sleepwalking towards a major crisis by allowing the legal industry to do significant damage to consumers.  Anybody who is unfortunate enough to be at home during the day watching British television will know what I am talking about.<\/p> <p>These advertisements comprise payday loans that target the unemployed and ambulance-chasing solicitors encouraging people to come forth to sue.  Everybody has to pay for this.  The average insurance premium in the UK is approximately &euro;1,100, more than double ours.  We need to give ourselves some credit in this regard.  The UK actually needs to learn from us on this and not the other way around.<\/p><p> To echo what Mr. Niall Doyle said earlier, the gender equality ruling is an absolutely monstrous decision.  The law is an ass; sometimes pan-European law decided by a committee can be a monstrous ass.  This is a significant injustice to a large cohort in our society.  The two words &ldquo;equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; are often used in Irish debate as if they have the same meaning.  They do not.  They are different words with different meanings.  We are forcing equality into motor insurance at the clear expense of fairness.  It will seriously inconvenience Irish women, particularly young women drivers.  I will declare an interest as the AA has up to 100,000 motor insurance customers.  We are having to gear up for this.  There is no excuse for it.  We are now having to tell our women customers that the law has been changed in order to be unfair to them.  It is not a great point to make to one&rsquo;s customers.  The decision is out of our hands and it is an absolutely appalling decision with which we have been saddled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900014#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348050600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Niall Doyle for his plug for my advertising budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900015#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Brett"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348050600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1348050600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Is he a beneficiary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012091900015#Q00400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348050600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>The Road Safety Authority, RSA, is particularly well-funded.
