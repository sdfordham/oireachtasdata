We are all aware of the fact that we have a punitive level of parking charges and restrictions in most towns.  Local authorities should be trying to save town centres from desertion and destruction but in many instances they are actively destroying the vitality of our towns.  We must remember the enormous investment that has been made in town centres in recent years.  The retail core is a very significant economic hub in every town and it must be protected.  RGDATA carried out a survey which shows that the level of parking charges in all towns surveyed is punitive and that there are also many inconsistencies from one area to the next.  I ask that parking charges be standardised.  We need new guidelines to end inconsistencies and to help to combat the pull of shoppers away from towns towards out of town shopping centres with free parking.  Standardised arrangements would provide a level playing pitch and would also provide additional funding for local authorities.  Although we may be closing the stable door after the horse has bolted in this regard, it could stop the drift towards out of town planning, which has been disastrous.  I commend the aforementioned report, about which I could say a lot more.  I ask that we have a debate on this issue.

While attending the assembly session in Strasbourg last week, I also had the opportunity to chair a legal affairs committee in Brussels.  Ireland's leadership and presence is critical for our Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Having just returned from Europe, I wish to raise a matter for debate which is linked to our priorities for the Presidency.  During the statements on the budget for 2013, I raised concerns about Ireland's corporate tax rate and its impact on developing countries as well as its impact on our own public services.  There is a significant difference between the nominal rate of 12.5% and the effective rate that multinational corporations operating in Ireland actually pay.  Due to the various tax breaks that are available to the multinationals, the effective tax rate, according to some sources, is only 5% or 6%.  I know Members are aware that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, recently responded to this and countered it by saying that the effective rate is as high as 11.9%.  Obviously there is some debate going on in terms of the research but locating a subsidiary in Ireland is, for many multinationals, a crucial part of their tax avoidance or, to use better language, tax minimisation schemes.  Developing countries lose more to tax avoidance by multinationals than they receive in aid, with Christian Aid putting forward the figure as high as $160 billion per year.  Our own public services are also affected, with SMEs contributing to the maintenance of the public services that sustain their businesses while multinationals avail of competitive advantages such as tax breaks and simply freeload off these services.<\/p><p>Such practices have recently come under scrutiny in France, as Members are aware, and at parliamentary hearings in the UK.  One of the things to emerge from the hearings is that compliance with standards as laid down by the law or by the EU can result in unethical practices and unfair outcomes, as the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello, recently admitted.  In the Minister of State's view, the issue should be dealt with in Brussels.<\/p><p>In that context, I have a question for the Deputy Leader.  The programme for Ireland's Presidency acknowledges that the EU provides more than half of global development assistance.  Our programme also states that Ireland wants to ensure that the EU's financial assistance to developing countries is as effective as possible.  I ask that we invite the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the House to debate the effectiveness of our development aid in light of our corporate tax rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000003#B00700","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1359538200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the Deputy Leader's announcement that we are to debate fluoridation this afternoon.

That pub was in the ownership of cousins of mine for almost 100 years before the current owners took it over.  In that context, I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, to return these coins, after the initial inspection and investigation, to the County Museum in Clonmel so that they can be housed there on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>The museum plays a significant role in the culture of south Tipperary.

However, as is the case in many other sectors it, too, is suffering as a result of the recession.  The recent scare in regard to the use of horse meat in burgers triggered a great deal of media reports on the maltreatment of horses, including some horrendous anecdotal stories of trainers turning horses out of their stables because the owners could not afford to feed or train them.

I am a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I congratulate the PSNI and Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na on the work they are doing.  During her visit about two months ago to Hannah House in Dublin, I spoke to the assistant commissioner of the PSNI about the arrangements in place for garda\u00ed taking up service in the PSNI and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Such persons are required to resign their posts, lose one year's pension and have no guarantee of being able to return to their original post.  There is nothing in legislation to deal with this issue.  I propose to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  Many Members have called for a debate on the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the work it does.  Our garda\u00ed put their lives on the line for us.  We must recognise they are a group apart in preserving society.  We always admire doctors and nurses and so on but no group, other than the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, are asked to put their lives on line for us.

This is no surprise given the ESRI's statement that the most recent two budgets were the most unfair and unequal of the past six austerity budgets.<\/p><p>Yesterday, we had a good discussion on the Water Services Bill 2013.  During the debate on that Bill, I raised the need for the Government to poverty-proof policies and new charges being introduced.  Such calls when made are often met with derision from members of the Government.  However, they are genuine when one considers the human tragedies outlined in the report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, including that of an elderly couple, aged 82 and 85 years old, who for the first time in their long lives, with years of work behind them, had to ask it for help.  Many ordinary families are struggling to pay their mortgages and are now turning to the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul for help with purchasing heating oil and are not in a position to put food on the table.  That is what is happening in this State at this time.  This magnifies the call by Sinn F\u00e9in for policies to be poverty-proofed.<\/p><p>Despite that I have called on several occasions for a debate in this House on poverty, it has not yet happened.

At a meeting of the Galway Roscommon University Hospitals Group on Friday, we were give information which I believe indicates a scary trend in the current provision of health services.  Staff and management of the hospitals told us that there has been a marked increase - from 55 people per day this time last year to 65 this year, a 15% increase - in the number of people presenting at the accident and emergency departments during the past year.<\/p> <p>When I asked whether that was a local or national trend, I was told that it was the latter.  As the increase is predominantly among the elderly, it raises the question of why so many older people are presenting in hospitals.  I would surmise that it has to do with the cutbacks and people growing sicker.  We should examine this trend.<\/p><p>Questions must be asked about the way in which the Galway Roscommon University Hospitals Group has been developed as a model of hospital delivery.  It covers four hospitals - two in Galway city, Portiuncula, and Roscommon - and mention has been made of the possibility of including the hospitals in Castlebar, Sligo and Letterkenny in the trust.  However, the apparent emphasis on key performance indicators, KPIs, accountability and running the hospitals as a business is alarming, as there does not appear to be any KPI as regards the quality of service.<\/p><p>I am also concerned by the way the new hospital trust will relate to unionised labour within the hospitals.  I worry that the trust may be a way of circumventing the industrial relations scenario so that management can drive nurses' wages down.  The trust's CEO indicated to us that he hoped to have more wriggle room, as he put it, in wage negotiations.<\/p><p>We need to discuss this matter with the Minister for Health.  If this model for delivery is to be replicated across the country, we need to examine what a hospital trust will do, how it will work, whether it constitutes privatisation by stealth, to whom will the boards be accountable and how they will treat ordinary hospital workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000004#C00600","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359539400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe for his bravery and professionalism during his life, for his great contribution to his community, for his love of football and his capacity to train young people, and for his significant contribution to the Garda Representative Association, GRA.

Senator Kelly has raised a motion on the Adjournment this evening in the context of pre-election promises to the people of Roscommon and Sligo.  It is disturbing to believe that Ministers made their announcements regarding the Kilkenny and Wexford hospitals without the HSE board's awareness.

Yesterday, the Minister was colourful in his description of portakabins at one site and the use of a former pharmacy in another instance, but those circumstances are replicated throughout the entire country.  The flippancy of the Taoiseach is not welcome in dealing with what on the surface amounts to blatant corruption in most people's eyes.<\/p><p>These issues need to be clarified.  In Sligo, for example, a major capital project was announced in 2010 and is undergoing various processes in the HSE.  The people of Sligo and the north west would be as anxious as those in Roscommon to know what progress there has been.  While I acknowledge the best efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, Deputy McLoughlin and Senators O'Keeffe and Comiskey, they are not in Cabinet.  Is it the case that a hospital must be in proximity to a Minister to secure the progression of a capital project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000005#D00400","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1359539400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That never happened before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000005#D00500","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1359539400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>If it is the case, the people of the north west can rightly be concerned.

The provision of additional staff for that unit is being considered as part of the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000007#G00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1359540600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Can I have a copy of the note?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000007#G00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1359540600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Yes, I will give the Senator a copy of the briefing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000007#G00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1359540600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy Leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000007#G00600","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1359540600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>With regard to the other health-related issue the Senator raised, I have no difficulty asking the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health to come to the House for a debate on health services.  The Government is engaged in a radical programme of reform of health care.  Targets for trolley numbers have been significantly reduced and waiting time targets for surgery are being met.  Significant progress has been made.  The programme for Government contains an ambitious plan to introduce a system of universal health insurance to meet the needs of people, something about which many of us are passionate in the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  We have had a policy on this for many years to ensure we do away at last with the dreadful two-tier system in the health service.  This is the overall reform that the Minister and the Government is intent on and that we should all support.<\/p><p>On the issue of the upgrading of the two hospitals in Kilkenny and Wexford to which the Deputy referred, I will supply the Senator with a copy of the briefing I received, which sets out the factual position.  Members have been bandying words such as &quot;corruption&quot; around carelessly in the Chamber.  We need to be cautious about this.  Both hospitals were included in the capital plan for 2010 to 2015, which predates the Government.  Both projects were at design stage and significant work had been carried out in the context of planning and design.  As Senator Michael D'Arcy helpfully pointed out, the accident and emergency department in Wexford hospital was in poor condition while the Kilkenny unit was housed in a portakabin and, therefore, there was no doubt about the need for upgrades.  The proposed extension to Wexford hospital featured in the HSE regional service plan for 2011 and preceding years.  Planning permission for the project was lodged in 2010 by the HSE and was granted by Wexford Borough Council in 2011.  Design and planning work had commenced as far back as 2009.  The upgrading of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, was included in the overall capital plan.  There was no doubt about the needs being met.  I can invite the Minister for Health to the House to address this issue in the context of a debate on the reform of the health care system generally.  The grouping of hospitals is designed to ensure hospitals will develop to their full potential in order that patients receive expert treatment using the concept of centres of excellence coupled with the concept of treating patients as close to home as possible at the lowest level of complexity.  We should all support that reform principle.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan raised the RGDATA report and the survey about the health of the retail industry.  This is an important topic and I agree we should have a debate on this.<\/p><p>I congratulate Senator Zappone on her appointment to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  I am glad she will represent us there along with other colleagues.  She raised the interesting and important issue of the impact on development countries of low corporate tax rates in the developed world.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Joe Costello, will be keen to address this.  He previously accepted an invitation to come to the House for a debate on Irish Aid and overseas development aid, hopefully, before the end of February.  The Senator should raise the issue during that debate.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett welcomed the Private Members' debate on the fluoridation motion.  We considered it important, despite that fact that the House will adjourn for most of the day as a mark of respect to the late Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and to enable colleagues to attend the funeral, to proceed with Private Members' business and it has been scheduled accordingly.  The Senator also raised the reform of the Garda compensation scheme and the Garda compensation (amendment) Bill.  He said the Bill should be expedited.  That is a good idea and I will pass his request on to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Given what has happened, everyone would approve of that.  <\/p><p>Senator Landy raised the issue of the find of gold coins in Carrick-on-Suir and the event in the National Museum later.  I will write to the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht about the return of the coins to the county museum in Clonmel, although I acknowledge the Senator will do so as well.  I wonder whether it would be worth asking the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about this when he comes to the House tomorrow for statements on The Gathering because it is another way to encourage visitors, for example, to go to Clonmel.  I was not aware there was a county museum and that it had the first Olympic gold medals won by an Irish athlete.  This also comes within the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan called for a review of the horse racing industry.  He could raise this with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport tomorrow.  Members will have an opportunity to ask questions.  While the debate is about The Gathering, people come to Ireland to attend horse racing meetings and this comes within his brief.<\/p><p>Senator Keane paid tribute to the late Detective Garda Donohoe and expressed sympathy to Senator Henry.  She raised the issue of the PSNI and Garda arrangements.  She has tabled this matter on the Adjournment but the House could also have a wider debate on it.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane called for a debate on poverty, which he has called for previously.  I will ask the Leader about that.<\/p><p>Senator Mulcahy raised the Law Reform Commission report on missing persons.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality engaged with the LRC and produced an earlier report on missing persons.  There had been a good deal of liaison between us and the commission.  A number of groups appeared before the committee but we may look to the debate the report in the House.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh also raised the health issues and I have replied on them.  He referred to concerns about the new hospital trusts amounting to privatisation by stealth.  I utterly refute that.  There is no question of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000007#G00700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1359540600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>We should debate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000007#G00800","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1359540600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I have no problem debating it.

The Government is engaged in a radical programme of reform of health care.  Targets for trolley numbers have been significantly reduced and waiting time targets for surgery are being met.  Significant progress has been made.  The programme for Government contains an ambitious plan to introduce a system of universal health insurance to meet the needs of people, something about which many of us are passionate in the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  We have had a policy on this for many years to ensure we do away at last with the dreadful two-tier system in the health service.  This is the overall reform that the Minister and the Government is intent on and that we should all support.<\/p><p>On the issue of the upgrading of the two hospitals in Kilkenny and Wexford to which the Deputy referred, I will supply the Senator with a copy of the briefing I received, which sets out the factual position.  Members have been bandying words such as \"corruption\" around carelessly in the Chamber.  We need to be cautious about this.  Both hospitals were included in the capital plan for 2010 to 2015, which predates the Government.  Both projects were at design stage and significant work had been carried out in the context of planning and design.  As Senator Michael D'Arcy helpfully pointed out, the accident and emergency department in Wexford hospital was in poor condition while the Kilkenny unit was housed in a portakabin and, therefore, there was no doubt about the need for upgrades.  The proposed extension to Wexford hospital featured in the HSE regional service plan for 2011 and preceding years.  Planning permission for the project was lodged in 2010 by the HSE and was granted by Wexford Borough Council in 2011.  Design and planning work had commenced as far back as 2009.  The upgrading of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, was included in the overall capital plan.  There was no doubt about the needs being met.  I can invite the Minister for Health to the House to address this issue in the context of a debate on the reform of the health care system generally.  The grouping of hospitals is designed to ensure hospitals will develop to their full potential in order that patients receive expert treatment using the concept of centres of excellence coupled with the concept of treating patients as close to home as possible at the lowest level of complexity.  We should all support that reform principle.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan raised the RGDATA report and the survey about the health of the retail industry.  This is an important topic and I agree we should have a debate on this.<\/p><p>I congratulate Senator Zappone on her appointment to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  I am glad she will represent us there along with other colleagues.  She raised the interesting and important issue of the impact on development countries of low corporate tax rates in the developed world.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Joe Costello, will be keen to address this.  He previously accepted an invitation to come to the House for a debate on Irish Aid and overseas development aid, hopefully, before the end of February.  The Senator should raise the issue during that debate.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett welcomed the Private Members' debate on the fluoridation motion.  We considered it important, despite that fact that the House will adjourn for most of the day as a mark of respect to the late Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and to enable colleagues to attend the funeral, to proceed with Private Members' business and it has been scheduled accordingly.  The Senator also raised the reform of the Garda compensation scheme and the Garda compensation (amendment) Bill.  He said the Bill should be expedited.  That is a good idea and I will pass his request on to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Given what has happened, everyone would approve of that.  <\/p><p>Senator Landy raised the issue of the find of gold coins in Carrick-on-Suir and the event in the National Museum later.  I will write to the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht about the return of the coins to the county museum in Clonmel, although I acknowledge the Senator will do so as well.  I wonder whether it would be worth asking the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about this when he comes to the House tomorrow for statements on The Gathering because it is another way to encourage visitors, for example, to go to Clonmel.  I was not aware there was a county museum and that it had the first Olympic gold medals won by an Irish athlete.  This also comes within the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan called for a review of the horse racing industry.  He could raise this with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport tomorrow.  Members will have an opportunity to ask questions.  While the debate is about The Gathering, people come to Ireland to attend horse racing meetings and this comes within his brief.<\/p><p>Senator Keane paid tribute to the late Detective Garda Donohoe and expressed sympathy to Senator Henry.  She raised the issue of the PSNI and Garda arrangements.  She has tabled this matter on the Adjournment but the House could also have a wider debate on it.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane called for a debate on poverty, which he has called for previously.  I will ask the Leader about that.<\/p><p>Senator Mulcahy raised the Law Reform Commission report on missing persons.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality engaged with the LRC and produced an earlier report on missing persons.  There had been a good deal of liaison between us and the commission.  A number of groups appeared before the committee but we may look to the debate the report in the House.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh also raised the health issues and I have replied on them.  He referred to concerns about the new hospital trusts amounting to privatisation by stealth.  I utterly refute that.

It is not my intention in any sense to impugn the reputation or motives of any of those on either side, including those who consider it to be extremely important to have fluoridation in the water.  However, never in 25 years of raising these issues have I received such a volume of correspondence from people from all walks of life and all parts of the country.  I have to hand some of the e-mails I have received in this regard, including one that I found very charming, from Mercy Secondary School, Mounthawk, Tralee, County Kerry, which is organising a puppet show to examine the issue.  It is very interesting to have the engagement of young people.  I am really sorry that the Government parties, the senior Government party in particular, have decided, presumably, to call a vote on this motion.  This appears to be stifling debate, particularly in light of the fact that in 2001, Fine Gael gave a clear and absolute promise that immediately on entering government, it would end fluoridation of water in Ireland.  There has been a complete turnaround in this regard and that is very regrettable.<\/p><p>  I am old enough, as I hit 70, to remember the dental situation that obtained here when the state of teeth was extremely bad.  I looked, for example, at the evidence given by Dr. O'Mullane, who was one of the principal proponents of fluoridation, who stated:<blockquote>I worked in the School Dental Service in West Cork for a number of years in the mid 1960's. Children constantly had gum boils and toothaches and I spent all of my time travelling from town to town extracting teeth.  That was all I could do. ... [extracting] ... the teeth of frightened children.<\/blockquote>That is not good and the motivation of those who introduced fluoride was to rectify this situation.  However, we now have fluoride toothpaste, which was not then available, and this may have influenced the judgment in the Ryan case.  Dental hygiene certainly has improved and I note dental caries are not created by the absence of fluoride in the water but instead are created by acids produced by sugar on the teeth.  Therefore, it is much more likely that diet is a significant factor.  Furthermore, the highest authorities in America have decided the delivery of fluoride actually is topical or, in other words, it depends on getting it directly to the targeted area, rather than systemic.  Consequently, delivering it through a water supply is unnecessary, uneconomic and questionable in that I have to hand a quotation from a doctor in this regard who stated he could not imagine any other doctor prescribing for a patient he had not seen, whose medical condition he did not know and whose dosage he could not control.  However, that is what happening with fluoride and a question certainly exists in this regard.<\/p><p>  Another point is that section 6 of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 has never been implemented.  It mandated that there should be continuous general health reviews.  This has not happened and I wonder what is the reason.  My first call would be for the need for baseline data on fluoride impacts.  In this context, consideration must be given to bone effects, immuno-compromised people in respect of cancer, endocrine effects, thyroid effects, pineal gland effects, insulin secretion effects, neurological effects and renal effects.  I do not wish to do this simply to cause a scare of any kind but these are the areas that may be affected.<\/p><p>  I am not in a position to make a scientific determination on these matters but I will simply point to some of the evidence, including from Dr. Hans Moolenburgh, a scientist who persuaded the Dutch authorities not to introduce fluoridation under any circumstances.  In fact, they have introduced a constitutional prohibition on it.  I also refer to the work from the National Research Council,<i><\/i>Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of EPA's Standards, published by the National Academies Press in America.<\/p> <p>It has a very serious track record in dealing not just with this issue but with traces of arsenic in water, with environmental pollution through the atmosphere and so on.  It is a reputable body.  There are also Dr. Waugh's interventions in his publications.  I wrote to the Minister for Health about a year ago and we had a desultory correspondence about it which I did not find satisfactory, ultimately, so I decided to investigate further.  I came across the Fluoride (Repeal of Enactments) Bill 2002, produced by the former Deputy John Gormley, subsequently the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  He is a senior person and a man of considerable intellect.  In the explanatory memorandum, he states:<blockquote><br \/>There is now a scientific consensus that fluoride works topically and does not need to be ingested to protect teeth.  All the evidence shows that too much fluoride in the body gives rise to fluorosis, which is on the increase, and to other health effects.  When water fluoridation has been stopped in other countries, there has been no increase of dental caries as a result.  This Bill means that no fluoride will be added by local authorities to Irish drinking water supplies.<\/blockquote>That is all that is contained in the explanatory memorandum and for somebody as senior as former Deputy Gormley, who has a scientific background, to say that is of considerable interest.  <\/p><p> This matter is topical because last night we passed the Water Services Bill, which established Uisce \u00c9ireann, with Bord Gais given the task of putting in meters.  We are now going to pay for water and when one is paying for a substance it is at least reasonable to expect that one gets it in a pure state or is at the very least consulted as to what kinds of chemicals or medicines are put in it.  <\/p><p> I ask that the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children revisits the report which was provided to that committee.  I also wish to put on the record the comments of Professor John Doull, chairman of the 2006 National Research Council review, Fluoride in Drinking Water: A Scientific Review of the EPA's Standards, who said:<blockquote>What the committee found is that we&#8217;ve gone with the status quo regarding fluoride for many years - for too long really - and now we need to take a fresh look&#8230; In the scientific community people tend to think this is settled.  I mean, when the US surgeon general comes out and says this is one of the top ten greatest achievements of the 20th century, that&#8217;s a hard hurdle to get over.  But when we looked at the studies that have been done, we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should, considering how long this [fluoridation] has been going on.  <\/blockquote>This echoes, very interestingly, the comments of Professor Trevor Sheldon in a letter to the press after the publication of the York report.  He said:<blockquote>The review team was surprised that in spite of the large number of studies carried out over several decades there is a dearth of reliable evidence with which to inform policy.  Until high quality studies are undertaken providing more definite evidence, there will continue to be legitimate scientific controversy over the likely effects and costs of water fluoridation.<\/blockquote>Controversy and questions remain.<\/p><p> I read the report of the forum on fluoridation which accepts that 95% of the public is opposed to fluoridation, which raises questions about a democratic deficit.  The public responses included anger or displeasure over perceived involuntary mass medication of the public, concerns over the origins and chemical contaminants in fluoride additive, fear of involuntary intake of excess fluoride from multiple sources, great concern over a lack of choice for consumers to use or avoid fluoride, a perception that Ireland is virtually unique in fluoridating drinking water and a widespread perception that many medical ailments are due to fluoride.  Perhaps these are only perceptions but the questions need to be answered and this is a forum in which they can be.  <\/p><p> We are alone, of all of the countries in Europe, in having mandatory inclusion of fluoride in drinking water.  Furthermore, the whole process is one of bullying.  In the 1960s, the then Minister for Health, Sean McEntee threatened to dissolve the city councils of Cork and Dublin because they were opposed to fluoridation.  The councillors were bullied.  The Fine Gael Party led the attack with superb speeches from James Dillon and Richie Ryan, indicating that there was a democratic deficit and that this was a kind of tyranny.  A lot more could be said but I will now make my final point.  It is important that we have a clear understanding of dental caries, which is defined by the Dental Health Foundation, Ireland thus: <blockquote>Caries begins with a small patch of demineralised (softened) enamel at the tooth surface, often hidden from sight in the fissures (grooves) or in between the teeth.  The destruction spreads into the dentine (the softer, sensitive part of the tooth beneath the enamel).  The weakened enamel then collapses to form a cavity and the tooth is progressively destroyed.<\/blockquote> The cause of caries is acid created by sugar and not the absence of fluoride.<\/p> <p>The other question is what is fluoride?  This is not to necessarily impugn fluoride as a chemical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000011#K00500","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359543600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000013#M00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1359543600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I will finish on this.

I welcome the Minister of State, who is an old friend of this House.  Senator Norris should be commended for introducing this topic.  I have two celebrations this weekend.  One is my granddaughter's seventh birthday and the other - also on Sunday - will mark my 20th anniversary in this House.  I mention this because in my first few weeks, this topic arose and I remember becoming involved in the fluoridation debate.  I supported the practice because of the existing evidence but I will now question whether the practice needs the same deserving attention it got in those days.<\/p><p>All policies should be reviewed regularly and the practice of adding fluoride to the national water supply is no different.  I am delighted to have a discussion today, although I am disappointed there is a Government amendment, which I have not seen.  I am glad the Seanad has taken the lead in the review process and is examining this issue, which is of national importance.  I will consider the matter from both the philosophical and practical perspectives.  We should also try to avoid exaggeration and scare stories, doing our best to consider the issue in a detached matter, weighing up why the Minister for Health should review the process of adding fluoride to the national water supply.<\/p><p>The basic argument for adding fluoride to water is that it helps to improve the dental condition of citizens, especially those who do not look after their own teeth very well.  Various studies have pointed to a much reduced incidence of tooth decay in fluoridated areas compared with those which are not fluoridated.  The World Health Organization supports the use of fluoridation, as does the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which calls it one of the top ten public health achievements of the 20th century.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, there are many arguments against adding fluoride to the water supply, and the Minister of State should consider these.  Many studies consider the dental benefits of fluoride and that improving diets would have a greater impact on dental health.  Many experts argue that the positives do not outweigh the negatives, and we should consider whether we need as much fluoride in our water.  Since the 1960s, when fluoridation was introduced in Ireland, a range of products containing fluoride have come to the market and dental care has much improved.  Health care has made massive strides since.<\/p><p>Many studies advocating fluoridation do not mention the improvement of dental health that correlates with increasing incomes.  It seems that the argument for fluoridation could stand up in the 1960s because of socio-economic difficulties but it is hard for it to do so in 2013.  Senator Norris has indicated that most countries in Europe have discontinued the practice of fluoridation so why do only Ireland and 10% of the UK and Spain continue the practice?  Some of the countries to ban the use of fluoridation include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.  Switzerland stopped fluoridation after 20 years, indicating it was ineffective, and Belgium went as far as to ban tablets and chewing gum containing fluoride because of fears it might increase the incidence of brittle bone disease.  Is Ireland right on the issue and the rest of Europe wrong?<\/p><p>There is a range of side-effects linked to excessive fluoride use, with the most common being a condition called dental fluorosis.  With this condition, there is a change in the appearance of teeth caused by a change in enamel formation.  That occurs during teeth development.  In addition, various studies have pointed to lowered intelligence quotient levels in children, increased incidence of bone cancer in teenage boys, as well as increased risk of bone fractures and thyroid dysfunction.<\/p> <p>Can we ignore or put up with these many documented side effects?  <i>The Lancet<\/i>, which is considered one of the world's leading medical journals, describes fluoride as &quot;an emerging neuro-toxic substance&quot; that may damage the developing brain.  Should we act now or wait for more evidence?  In addition, fluoride can potentially affect the nervous system, the kidneys, the bones and other tissues in young children during their critical stage of organ development.  We were to discuss children's early development in the Seanad today and we have deferred that debate for the time being.  Can we be serious about this commitment if we do not consider such effects on babies and children?<\/p><p> It is interesting to note that the European Commission Directorate General for Health and Consumers notes that European Union-wide trends show a reduction in tooth decay in children of 12 years of age, regardless of whether water is fluoridated.  It states there is no obvious advantage in favour of water fluoridation compared with application via toothpaste, mouthwash or gel.  It goes on to state that the effect of continued exposure to fluoride from whatever source is questionable once the permanent teeth have erupted.  This information is all new.  It certainly did not exist 20 years ago when I spoke about it.  The Government is very quick to take on any EU legislation.  I wonder why it is not as quick to consider findings such as these.  Is it just being selective about what we should do about this? <\/p><p> We should also consider what our neighbours are doing.  In 2004, following a public consultation, Scotland's Parliament rejected proposals to fluoridate public drinking water on ethical grounds.  Other countries, including France, Greece and Denmark, have already put high taxes on sugary drinks.  In other words, they have taken other action to aim at achieving the same benefits.<\/p><p> This issue is worthy of discussion.  I hope we will have that discussion this afternoon.  I congratulate Senator Norris for raising it and look forward to hearing the opposing views also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000013#M00600","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359543900,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Colm Burke I would like to acknowledge the presence in the Visitors' Gallery of the mayor of Bandon, Councillor Sean O'Donovan, and his young friends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000014#N00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1359543900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote><br \/>To delete all words after &quot;Seanad \u00c9ireann&quot; and substitute the following:<br \/>&quot;notes that water fluoridation is a major plank of public health policy in Ireland in the prevention of tooth decay;<br \/>notes that water fluoridation is recognised by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th Century;<br \/>notes that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects to human health; but<br \/>notes also that fluoridation, and its effects on health and related matters, is kept under constant review.&quot;.<\/blockquote>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome this debate and the contributions of Senators Norris and Quinn.  I would agree with them that just because something is written as policy it is not written in stone for ever more.  I agree also that it must be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Even the amendment states that this matter needs to be kept under review.<\/p><p>  Senator Quinn stated earlier that fluoridation of water was one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century.  That is what is contained in information made available to us.<\/p><p>  A Forum on Fluoridation was set up in 2002 and a comprehensive review was undertaken at that stage.  I have not read all of the report but I read the main part of it and it appears that a comprehensive review was undertaken in 2002.  I am aware that some experts will disagree with that but to give a brief summary of the structure of the report, it dealt with issues of public concern, dental decay and the methods employed in its prevention and control, and the delivery of oral health care services to the Irish population along with international comparisons.  It gave an account of the history of water fluoridation from both an Irish and an international perspective and a description of fluoridation status on a worldwide basis.  It examined the public water supply system which includes an account of the various standards with which treatment processes must comply.  It also examined the current legislation.  It examined the benefits and risks of water fluoridation with particular reference to dental fluorosis.  <\/p> <p>The report is comprehensive about what was done in 2002, which was only ten years ago.  I imagine research has not changed substantially in the meantime.  An expert body on fluoridation was set up in 2004 and the issue continues to be under review but there has been no major policy change because all the available information indicates there are advantages to maintaining the current policy.<\/p><p>The 60th assembly of the World Health Organization explicitly recommended &quot;for those countries without access to optimal levels of fluoride and which have not yet established systematic fluoridation programmes to consider the development and implementation of fluoridation programmes giving priority to equitable strategies such as the automatic administration of fluoride, for example, in drinking water and to the provision of affordable fluoride toothpaste&quot;.  The WHO, therefore, recommended this in countries where such programmes were not operational.  I agree with Senator Norris that some countries have decided to opt out of this policy and have voted on it.  In one Canadian state assembly, the vote was 50.3% against water fluoridation.  There is a divided view on the issue but the facts that have been established in Ireland, particularly in the 2002 report, suggest the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and there is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, to suggest that the current policy is having a detrimental effect on people's health.  We have had this policy for more than five decades and it would benefit the population if it were continued.  The issue should be kept under review and if further research becomes available, we can review it at that stage.  To date, I have not read of new research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000014#N00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359544200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Norris and Quinn for tabling this important motion on an issue that has generated a great deal of controversy.  I would like to outline the Fianna F\u00e1il position on this.  We believe that fluoridation is a public health measure that is good for the oral health of all age groups in society.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche\u00e1l Martin, launched the final report of the forum on fluoridation in September 2002, to which Senator Burke referred.  He established the forum in 2000 to independently review the fluoridation of public pipe water supplies and a programme of research was undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area and to make recommendations.  The forum largely comprised people with expert knowledge from a diverse range of backgrounds such as public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, heath promotion and the consumer and environmental sectors.  The forum took a participatory and evidence-based approach, striving to ensure balance between participants on both sides of the debate, and it went out of its way to engage those opposed to water fluoridation.<\/p><p>The former Minister subsequently established the Irish expert body on fluorides and health in April 2004.  The body monitors new and emerging issues in fluorides and its effect on health and related matters.  It is satisfied, having studied current peer reviewed scientific evidence worldwide, that water fluoridation causes no ill effects to the health of adults or children.  Given the policy has been reviewed by the forum on fluoridation and the expert body continues to provide impartial, evidence-based expert advice on fluoridation, some people suggest it is not necessary to commission a further review but because of the controversy generated by the issue, I am leaning towards the wording of the motion, which is about the review of, as opposed to the cessation of, the practice of fluoridation.<\/p> <p>On the issue of testing for fluoride in Ireland, under the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007, water service authorities are required to arrange for the testing on a daily basis of the fluoride content of water to which fluoride has been added.  There is much more going on in the context of tests on which I am sure the Minister of State will elaborate.  To date there has been a significant reduction in the proportions of decayed, missing and filled teeth in children living in areas supplied by fluoridated drinking water in Ireland.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation at the optimal level does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.  However, water fluoridation is less common in Europe where fluoridated salt is often available as an alternative, although some populations are supplied with naturally fluoridated public water.<\/p><p>Perhaps I can deal with what has been the water fluoridation controversy.  It arises from moral, ethical, political and safety concerns regarding the fluoridation of public water supplies.  It occurs mainly in English speaking countries as continental Europe has ceased water fluoridation.  That those opposed argue that water fluoridation may cause serious health problems is not effective enough to justify the costs and has a dosage that cannot be precisely controlled.  Opposition to fluoridation has existed since its initiation in the 1940s.  I am thankful to Wikipedia for this information.  During the 1950s and 1960s some opponents of water fluoridation suggested that fluoridation was a communist plot to undermine public health.  It was more or less people who might have been on the far right of American politics who saw the communist plot as being an introduction to socialism - that awful thing they sometimes talk about in America.  I can never quite understand what it is our friends on the Republican side are getting at. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000015#O00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359544500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>One could not have that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000016#P00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1359544500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>No, one could not have that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000016#P00300","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1359544500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Citing impacts on the environment, the economy and on health the Green Party of Canada seeks a ban on artificial fluoridation products.

However, in favour of fluoridation the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said the fluoridation of public water has been hailed as one of the top medical achievements of the 20th century which has been mentioned by earlier speakers.  It ranks 9th on this list, ahead of recognition of tobacco use as a health hazard.

Can anyone imagine putting fluoridation in with those very important issues?  Water was fluoridated in large parts of the Netherlands from 1960 to 1973 but the supreme court declared fluoridation of drinking water unauthorised.  As a barrister, the Minister of State is probably aware that the Supreme Court in Ryan <i>v<\/i>. Attorney General in 1965 held that water fluoridation did not infringe the plaintiff's right to bodily integrity.  However, the court did find that such a right to bodily integrity did exist, despite the fact that it was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, thus establishing the doctrine of unenumerated rights in Irish constitutional law.  In the US to date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort, that is, the state supreme court in America, has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.<\/p><p>  Water fluoridation is used in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and in a handful of other countries.

Despite what I have said about the pros and cons of this argument, technology is constantly evolving.

In seconding the Government amendment to the motion, it is important to state clearly that it is the opinion of the Government and our health advisers that there is no health risk involved in the fluoridation of the public drinking water.  For us to agree to a review would certainly undermine public confidence and therefore the Government will not be supporting Senator Norris's proposed review.  However, as Senator Mooney mentioned, the expert group on fluoride and health has the situation under continual review.  We will be advised by this impartial and expert group.  Fluoride was first added to public drinking water 65 years ago and the undoubted benefits have been alluded to already.  I have received some representations on the motions in recent days.  Some of them exhorted me to ignore the advice given by the expert group and Government advisers on the matter and perhaps come up with some other independent advice.  I read the expert group report and the report of the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.  The argument needs to be made in the most robust terms that apart from some evidence of dental fluorosis, there is no known health risk through the use of fluoride in the public drinking water.<\/p><p>Some of the evidence used in Mr. Waugh's report is said by the expert group to be selective and to misinterpret much of what has been said.  It goes so far as to state that it appears that some of the views expressed in Mr. Waugh's report are at variance with those of the authors of the same reports.  While I acknowledge that at more than 300 pages, it is a substantial body of work and must be commended, it might not be as complete as perhaps it should be.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney referred to the pros and cons of the argument and I will not repeat what he said.<\/p> <p>I will merely compare areas where there is fluoridation of water and areas where such is not public policy.  One place very close to home where there is fluoridation of water is here in the South of Ireland and, as Senator Cullinane will undoubtedly tell us, there is no fluoridation of water as public policy in the North of Ireland.  The evidence of the benefits is quite clear, that even today there are between 30% and 50% fewer dental caries in the South than there are in the North.<\/p><p>We need to look at the evidence provided by the authorities.  Senator Norris stated that dietary sugar is the cause of dental caries.  No doubt it is a significant cause of dental caries.

There is legislative underpinning in Ireland, not in other countries, but that does not involve the mandatory adding of fluoride of water.

I thank Senator Norris for tabling this Private Members' motion today to allow us review the position on fluoridation of water in the State.<\/p><p>It is an interesting issue and it has provoked continual debate not only in this country, but around the world.  One could argue that there are many issues that we could be discussing here today which, on a scale or hierarchy, would be more important that this issue but that does not mean that we should not be having this debate.  Private Members' time is an opportunity for us to have these kind of discussions, both in the Lower House and in this House as well.  These are matters of public concern which are being discussed outside of this House.  It is important for Senator Norris to bring forward this motion so that the House can be part of that debate because while this debate is happening in the scientific sphere, it is important it happens in the political sphere as well.  I commend Senator Norris.<\/p><p>The point has been made already that there are many different opinions on this issue.  For every report, either nationally or internationally, that the fluoridation of water is good, there are counter reports which say something else.  We then must make up our minds and make judgments.  There are many different points of view on this issue among health care professionals.  That is obvious given the many different reports.<\/p><p>An important point made by Senator Norris which needs to be taken on board was that this process was put in place at a time when even the industrialised world had very poor dental health mechanisms.<\/p> <p>The sole reason for its introduction was the danger of tooth decay and cavities.  We must acknowledge we have come a long way on the journey of ensuring we have very good dental health and oral hygiene in the State and in most industrialised countries.  Given the massive improvements in this area it is timely to review the process.  It is also important to ensure we continue to put in place resources so young children in particular have access to dentists and proper treatment, and that they have the appropriate level of dental health care to avoid the incidence of tooth decay.<\/p><p>The question we are asked to discuss in the motion is whether the fluoridation of water is appropriate or necessary for the oral health of citizens.  This is the fundamental question.  In particular, it is generally believed that although water fluoridation can cause dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of developing teeth, the extent of this can vary.  People have very clear concerns and not only in Ireland but throughout the world.  Only this week the Australian city of Cairns ceased to fluoridise its water on the basis it constitutes the mandatory medication of its citizens.  According to a spokesperson for Cairns council, if people want to have access to fluoride they should take it up with their dentist and that the decision has been made that it should not be forced on people without consent.  I broadly share this view.  I do not think it should be a mandatory process but a matter of choice.  I agree with Senator Norris on this issue.<\/p><p>The issue of cost is not the only issue.  If I felt this genuinely benefitted citizens and ensured a reduction in decay it would be worth it.  According to a response to a parliamentary question from the former Minister of State, Deputy R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall, it costs approximately \u20ac4.78 million a year.  This was the amount spent in 2010.  Of this, \u20ac1.36 million was spent on the acid or chemical used as part of the process.  At the time, the then Minister of State said the Government had no plans to discontinue the policy.  I assume this is still the position of the Government.<\/p><p>It is a matter of choice and we must reflect on the wealth of reports and knowledge and information we have on the issue.  Ultimately it is a matter for the Government, the Minister for Health and the Cabinet to reflect on it and decide whether they believe continuing the policy is best for citizens.  It is worthwhile to table a motion such as this to give us an opportunity as public representatives to reflect the fact that even though many important issues exist people are interested in this issue and have very strong views on it.  I was very surprised that I was lobbied and received many e-mails about this debate.  Many of the e-mails were very technical and scientific and contained very well thought out and well argued points of view on both sides.<\/p><p>To summarise the views of those against, it is not so much an issue of cost but of choice and the potential dangers they feel are associated with the process.  Even if such dangers are mild, and some clinicians and dentists have the view it can cause problems but they recognise these problems are mild, it is still an issue for the citizens who believe they should have a choice in the matter.  For me this is at the heart of the issue.  I thank Senator Norris for tabling the motion.  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000018#R01800","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359546000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Like Senator Quinn I can also go back quite a few years with regard to this issue, as I tabled a motion in South Dublin County Council on the matter.<\/p> <p>I have four pages to read but I do not know whether to read out two pages for or two pages against fluoridation.

We have heard both sides of the argument but we, as parliamentarians, need a scientific answer on the fluoride product used.<\/p><p>There is no fluoridation in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, and only 10% in England.

I ask the Minister of State to ask the scientific working group to update its information on its website because it is quite old and needs to be reviewed.  The motion also seeks a review.  When I looked at the website I discovered that the last report covered the period of 2004-08.  I want a new factual report on fluoridation prepared that consists of the latest scientific research.<\/p><p>The expert group submitted a report in 2004.  The group was established in 2004 to monitor new and emerging issues on fluoride, its effects on health and related matters.  It advised that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirmed that water fluoridation at the optimal level - and it is important to note that term - does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and the most cost-effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  I refer to the scientific report of the group that the Government established in 2002 which submitted its first report in 2004.  We need new information that is up to date because science has moved on.  I could not find current information on the website.  Perhaps it does exist.  All I found was information that dated back to 2008 but science moves very fast. <\/p><p>I support the Government's motion because I am no wiser now about water fluoridation than I was 15 years ago.  The health programme has improved the oral health of the population, especially in children.  However, the other side of the campaign states that fluoride is corrosive and leads to bad dental enamel and everything else that goes with it.  People also endorse the view that fluoride is the best available and most reliable option because scientific evidence has indicated that the maximum permitted level of fluoridation of water is safe.  I shall not repeat the figure because Members have already heard it.  <\/p><p>Northern Ireland is our nearest neighbour but it does not add fluoride to water.

River basin districts will be divided regionally.  <\/p> <p>With the establishment of Uisce \u00c9ireann we must have a commonality of approach, given the fact that river basin districts are divided regionally, and that one of our river basin districts straddles the Border with Northern Ireland.

I am grateful that Senators Norris and Quinn have tabled this motion because, as has been said on both sides of the House, all policy should be reviewed.  However, this policy has been reviewed.  It used to be a test case example of public policy that we did the research before introducing fluoridation of water.  We found that where fluoride was naturally present, such as in Patrickswell, County Limerick, and Gyles' Quay, County Louth, dental health was far better in those locations.  Therefore, this is not a poison, as some of the extreme critics would say.  It is present naturally and is seen to have positive benefits for dental health.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Keane's point, there are many studies to support superior dental health in terms of the DMFT - decayed, missing or filled teeth - oral health index in the Republic of Ireland compared with Northern Ireland.  It has been a success therefore.  Senator Cullinane mentioned the sum of \u20ac5 million out of a \u20ac17 billion health budget.  If one can get the level of benefits we have had from fluoride for such a small amount it is well worth continuing with it.  The research also shows that the doubts cast about water fluoridation have been rebutted fairly recently.<\/p><p>The first finding of the expert group was that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children but also of adults, including the elderly.  Professor O'Moore of TCD led the group that did the original research and even at that stage she was saying that the amount of fluoride one would have to consume to damage soft tissue was beyond the capacity of any individual.<\/p><p>Legitimate concerns have been raised, however, and they are worth dealing with.  It is a credit to this House that my two colleagues tabled the motion before us.  In 2010, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks report stated that fluoride in drinking water does not appear to hamper children's neural development.  Neither does fluoride cause gastro-intestinal complaints or bone ailments.  The report's authors also said that it does not damage children's IQ test scores.  They have gone through all those points. <\/p><p>While I appreciate that my learned friend has adduced information on how Scotland feels, the rest of the UK is strongly of the view that fluoridation has been a benefit.<\/p> <p>In 1985, Professor Knox reported:<blockquote><br \/>We have found nothing in any of the major classes of epidemiological evidence which could lead us to conclude that either fluoride occurring naturally in water, or fluoride added to water supplies, is capable of inducing cancer, or of increasing the mortality from cancer.  This statement applies both to cancer as a whole, and to cancer at a large number of specific sites.  In this, we concur with the great majority of scientific investigators and commentators in this field.<\/blockquote>There is overwhelming evidence that this has been a success.  It has worked and has improved the dental health of the nation.<\/p><p> Another finding is that there were benefits to bone structure.  A US study in the <i>British Medical Journal <\/i>from 2000 found that exposure to fluoridation was associated with an increase in bone mass at the lumbar spine and proximal femur and a slight decrease in the risk of hip and vertebral fractures.  The dental school in Trinity College Dublin strongly favours fluoridation, which, it could probably be argued, is against its own interests because if we did not do it and did not have the large improvement in the DMFT ratio, dentists would be busier.  Dentists support this policy even though it might be said it reduces the income of dentists.<\/p><p> It is important these issues are debated.  The weight of evidence is so overwhelmingly in favour of the Government's amendment to the motion, I will be supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000021#U00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359547200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion.

I have enjoyed listening to the healthy, non-partisan and open-minded contributions made from both sides of the House.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Norris for tabling this motion.  During the past few months I have been contacted by numerous people throughout the country who have genuine concerns about fluoridation of the public water supply.  These concerns are not vexatious and are not made by people wishing to stir up trouble for the sake of it.  It is, therefore, incumbent on us, in terms of our input to public policy, to address it in an informed way.  If the Government and Department of Health are minded to persist with current policy, they have a responsibility to assuage genuine public concerns by way of a public information campaign and so on.  It is not acceptable to dismiss these concerns out of hand.  I am not an expert in this matter.  We are at the mercy of the scientific evidence and expert reports available in this regard.  The phrase &quot;doctors differ&quot; comes to mind.  It is incumbent on us also not to cherry-pick the scientific data and evidence which supports our argument and suits our needs.<\/p><p>I am of two minds on this matter.  I am not persuaded one way or the other.  It appears to me that there are genuinely strong and persuasive arguments on both sides.  It is of concern that many EU countries have chosen to cease the practice of automatic fluoridation of public water supplies.  I am sure they are not doing so without good cause.  I find it a little ironic that Ireland, a country which takes so much of its lead from Europe on so many other matters and is so compliant and obedient with regard to virtually everything suggested by the EU, continues to with the practice of fluoridation.  If in the morning someone were to take a case to the European Court of Justice and win it, would the Government and Department of Health would be as strong and robust in its insistence on continuation of fluoridation of our water?  What would they do if Ireland were subjected to an EU directive in this regard?  I do not believe the case for fluoridation is cut and dried.<\/p><p>I ask that the Minister of State as part of his response at least consider assuaging public concerns by way of, as I suggested earlier, a public information campaign.  As pointed out by Senator Mooney and other Senators, this is an opportune time, in the context of the passing by this House earlier in the week of the legislation establishing the new Irish Water company, for Government to revisit and at least consider the latest evidence and concerns being expressed.  Nobody in this House or, I am sure, in the Department of Health would do anything to damage or put public health in danger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000022#V00200","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1359547200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000022#V00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359547200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I am sure everybody has the public interest at heart.

I compliment Senator Norris on tabling this motion.  It is only right and proper that such a significant public policy relating to the treatment of water is kept under constant review.  The Government amendment does not differ much from the motion tabled by Senator Norris in this regard.<\/p><p>I raised this issue some weeks ago on the Order of Business following receipt of extensive documentation on the matter from a chartered environmental scientist, Dr. Declan Waugh.  My attention was drawn to Dr. Waugh's reference in that correspondence to his ten year journey of discovery in relation to water fluoridation, from which he had drawn the conclusion that the science behind water fluoridation is deeply flawed and that the evidence of risk greatly outweighs the minor benefits associated with this policy.  Dr. Waugh pointed out that it is commonly known that while the World Health Organization endorses water fluoridation, it does so only where health authorities have demonstrated that the dietary intake of fluoride for all sectors of society, including the most sensitive subgroups of the population, are known and quantified.<\/p><p>Dr. Waugh subsequently forwarded further documentation to me which drew a link between water fluoridation and many of the significant health problems being experienced by people in this country, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  Dr. Waugh states that in the North of Ireland, where fluoridation does not take place, only 4% of the population suffers from diabetes, whereas 8.9% of the population in the Republic suffer from diabetes.  Other health problems identified were obesity, respiratory conditions, thyroid and cancer.  I am concerned about the availability of this information in the public domain and our not being able to prove one way or the other whether there is any link between water fluoridation and those particular health problems.  They are the negatives of this issue.<\/p><p>I will now address some of the positives.  In this regard, I refer to the Department of Health and the expert group on fluoridation and health which state that water fluoridation is the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental problems.<\/p> <p>According to them, water fluoridation is the \"adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries\".  The levels are controlled and are set at between 0.6 parts per million, ppm, and 0.8 ppm.  We have a strict monitoring regime of levels.  This monitoring is carried out within each local authority area by the HSE, which is charged with ensuring that all issues pertaining to public health are at the safest levels possible.<\/p><p>Like other Senators, I have a difficulty in reconciling the considerable divergence of opinion between those who oppose fluoridation and those who see it as a significant contributor to public health.  Senator Norris has done the House a great service by tabling this motion, as we need to keep this matter under constant discussion and review.  As has been stated, technology is improving and other countries throughout Europe are moving away from this system.  Perhaps we should consider the issue further.<\/p><p>I have confidence in the HSE and believe that we are receiving good advice, yet I recognise the fact that experts in this field hold other opinions.  It is important that this issue be given a full airing at the Oireachtas health committee.  I would welcome further debate on this matter of significant public interest.<\/p><p>I would not like the House to divide on this motion.  Senators are as one.  Although views differ, everyone has the same objective, in that we want to ensure the best possible outcomes for our people.

There have always been concerns about fluoridation.  The then Minister, Deputy Martin, set up the forum on fluoridation in 2000.  This resulted in the establishment of an expert body to advise the Minister on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology.  Several Senators have acknowledged this.<\/p><p>The forum's overall conclusions were that water fluoridation had been effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially that of children, and that the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicated that, at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water, human health was not adversely affected.  We have since established an expert body that continues to meet and advise the Minister.  It draws on national and international expertise.  This is a satisfactory situation and is how we should operate, that is, set up expert groups and leave them to discuss issues.  None of us in this House is a scientist or an engineer.  While I was an engineer in a previous existence, I would not claim to be an expert in any area.  The group has been set up and will examine reports as information becomes available.  This is satisfactory.  We should leave it at that.<\/p><p>Reference has been made to an individual who has e-mailed many of us, but I do not know whether his or her report has been published for peer review in the journals.  I would not expect the expert body to consider any report or information unless it was satisfactorily reviewed and accepted in the broad scientific community.  Until then, we should not publicly quote claims about linkages between health and the ingestion of fluoride or any substance.  We have a responsibility to act prudently in this and in all matters.<\/p><p>I am satisfied by our community's oral health and fluoride's impact on dental decay.  Senator Norris correctly stated that the consumption of sugary foods caused decay, but fluoride prevents dental decay, particularly in children.  Children from certain areas or economic backgrounds are more at risk.  We can speak lightly of decay, but children carry tooth decay into adulthood.  Repair work and fillings become necessary, teeth are lost, etc.  We should not underestimate oral and dental health, as they can have a significant effect on physical health.  They are important.  It is not just getting a filling.  Rather, it is a life-long impact on an individual's oral and dental health.  Surveys have consistently shown that, since the introduction of fluoride into drinking water, children in fluoridated areas have considerably lower levels of dental caries.<\/p><p>We have debated this matter and an expert group has been established with cross-field representation in the form of dentists, toxicologists, engineers, environmentalists, public representatives and public health experts.  I am regularly in contact with UCC's dental hospital, which is supportive of fluoridation.  It sees the results of fluoridation through its surveys.  To make a personal claim, I am married to a dentist who is committed to this matter.  He has worked with children who have not had the benefit of fluoridation.  The impact on them is stark, as is the contrast between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas in Cork.<\/p><p>I am a supporter of fluoridation and am confident in the medical evidence that shows that fluoridated water has no impact on people's health.  It is a positive public policy that we should support and we should be confident that the issue has been debated and that the expertise supports our policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000023#W00200","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1359547800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I acknowledge and thank the Senators for holding this debate.  I commend everyone who contributed, including Senators Norris and Quinn, who tabled this motion.  The Government will not support it in its current form, but the Government has proposed an amendment that provides for the continuing review of this important issue of public interest and concern.  As such, the amendment seems to cover the point about the need for these matters to be kept under review.<\/p><p>I wish to address a comment made by Senator Cullinane.  He was not necessarily being critical, but it is important that I address his point.  Senator Barrett and others on all sides of the argument also touched on it.  It is not the Government's intention, wish or belief that there would not be a debate on this issue or that raising and considering it in a motion of the House would not be appropriate.  As a Minister of State in the Department, I would not be entitled to have an objection to the Seanad doing so.  The Government has no objection to there being informed public debate, as has been the case with this discussion.<\/p><p>Most of those present in the Chamber are not scientists.  Irrespective of what side of the House we are on, we must all rely on the expert opinion, scientific evidence and the reports that have been prepared.<\/p> <p>On issues of public health or particularly issues which involve scientific or technical matters, we as politicians do not have that particular expertise to bring to the table in the way, for example, that Senator Barrett would have economic expertise or others would have different elements of expertise to bring to the table.  This is a serious point; most of us do not have that kind of experience, therefore, we have to rely on the evidence.  I think it was Senator Whelan who emphasised the importance of not being selective, not selecting this or that piece of evidence that might support an argument that we instinctively feel is right and then leap on one particular study and think it is the one I like most because it seems to accord with my thinking.  We have to examine the evidence.  What I would ask the House to do, and this is what the Government is doing with the Department of Health's approach to this, is to look at the preponderance of evidence.  No one is saying there are no studies that are critical of the policy or that there are no interventions that do not criticise or question the policy.  There are such studies and certainly there are such claims, but I suggest in the strongest terms to colleagues that the preponderance of evidence supports a continuation of the policy of the Government while keeping it under continuing review.  That is what I would ask colleagues to agree to in the course of this discussion and, I respectfully ask, in the decision they will make on foot of the motion before them.<\/p><p> I support the Government's amendment to the motion which will come as no surprise.  Many of the Senators have already outlined the original rationale for fluoridation, namely, fluoride at the optimal level in the water supply provides what has been described as a repair kit for teeth, making teeth more resistance to decay in people of all ages.  I am very taken by the points that have been made in respect of the importance of dental health and it is not something that is a &quot;by the way&quot; comment or that can be treated lightly.  It is a vitally important element of public health.<\/p><p> An all-Ireland study on children's oral health in 2001-02 has shown that children and adolescents residing in fluoridated areas have fewer caries than those in non-fluoridated areas.  The Oral Health of Irish Adults Study 2000-2002 also showed decay scores were lower among fluoridated groups for all age groups and particularly in the 35 to 44 age group.  This is a study that puts clear evidence before us.<\/p><p> Water fluoridation is recognised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States public health service, as has been stated in the amendment to the motion, as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century.  Some 350 million people in 35 countries around the world have fluoridated water and 70% of the US population has water fluoridation.<\/p><p> The background to this, on which Senator Norris or others have touched, is that fluoridation began in Ireland in 1964 on foot of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960.  That Act provides that the health authorities shall arrange for the fluoridation of public piped-water supplies and that local authorities act as agents for the health authorities in providing, installing and maintaining equipment for fluoridation, in adding the fluoride to water and in testing the fluoride content of water to which fluoride has been added.  These functions are provided for in the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007<i><\/i>which revokes previous fluoridation regulations.  Currently approximately 68% of the population receives fluoridated public water supplies.<\/p><p> The policy of fluoridation, as was mentioned on a number of occasions in this debate, was the subject of a major review in 2000.  A Forum on Fluoridation was established by the then Minister for Health and Children which comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge from the fields of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, law and ethics, water quality and health promotion, together with a consumer representative.  The report of the forum was published in 2002.  Its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  The forum also recommended that given the increased access to fluoridated toothpaste and in light of the best available scientific evidence, the optimal level of fluoride in water should be redefined from the then level of 0.8 to 1 parts per million to between 0.6 and 0.8 parts per million with a target value of 0.7 parts per million.  The parts per million is equivalent to milligrams per litre.  This change was implemented by the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007, to which I have referred.  It is worth noting that EU law defines a maximum permitted concentration of 1.5 parts per million for public water supplies through its drinking water directives.  The Irish levels are set at less than half that permitted by EU legislation.<b><\/b><\/p><p> Another important recommendation of the forum was that an expert body should be established to implement the recommendations of the forum and to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research on all aspects of fluoride.  I emphasise the vital necessity of having a reliable source of scientific evidence that can be available for public consumption and for the information of public representatives such as ourselves in order that we can evaluate and assess the correctness or otherwise of the policy position being adopted.  That export body is an important element and support for our work as public representatives and as a Government.<\/p><p> The expert body on fluorides and health was established in 2004.  The expert body and its sub-committees have broad representation from areas such as dentistry, biochemistry, environmental health, public health medicine and food.  The expert body also has a consumer input in terms of members of the public and representatives of consumer interests.  The sub\u00adcommittees of the expert body may also co-opt members as the need arises.  Of the expert body's 17 members, five are members of the dental profession.  These include two former chief dental officers in the Department of Health, two senior academics, one of whom is also a former chief dental officer, and two from the public dental health service.  They have extensive experience in areas of public health, dental epidemiology, statistics, fluorides and health promotion.<\/p><p> In evaluating ongoing research on all aspects of fluoridation, the expert body accepts the fundamental scientific tenet, and this is important, that any single piece of scientific evidence by itself remains essentially hypothetical unless it can be repeated or confirmed by other scientists or other studies.  Therefore, it considers scientific evidence that has been submitted to examination by other scientists, usually by publication in recognised peer reviewed scientific journals, after such publication has been approved by independent referees, which is entirely in line with the practice that has been adopted for many years internationally in relation to the evaluation of scientific evidence.  This ensures that the advice provided by the expert body is impartial and evidence-based.<\/p><p> The expert body is satisfied, having studied current peer reviewed scientific evidence worldwide, that water fluoridation at the optimal level does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in improving the oral health of all age groups.  These views are supported by reputable international agencies and valid scientific articles and reviews.<\/p><p> I am aware that consumers sometimes express concerns about potential negative effects on health of drinking fluoridated water, on the composition and source of fluoride or on the fact that some countries do not fluoridate their water supplies.  I wish to assure the Senators that drinking fluoridated water with the optimal amount of fluoride is not harmful to human health.  The opinion of the expert body on this matter is supported by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health service and the surgeon general of the United States, the World Dental Federation, the International Association for Dental Research, the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.  A major review was conducted by the European Union in 2011.  The main conclusions of the report of the EU's Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks are that there is no known health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.<\/p><p> The only known side effect of optimal water fluoridation is mild dental fluorosis.  This has been known about since the 1930s.  Dental fluorosis is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look.  It is not considered to be an adverse health effect.  At the levels of fluoride present in Ireland's water supplies, any occurrence of dental fluorosis is very mild or mild and in most cases is only detectable by a dentist as faint white flecks on the surface of the teeth.  In the majority of cases dental fluorosis generally does not require any treatment.  Regularly conducted studies on dental health in Ireland, carried out when the upper limit for fluoridation was 1 parts per million - it is lower now - confirm the low level of dental fluorosis in Ireland.<\/p><p> The non-treatment of dental fluorosis has no health consequences.  The non-treatment of tooth decay, on the other hand as was mentioned, can lead to pain, trauma, disfigurement, loss of teeth and function, problems with nutrition and growth, absenteeism from school or work and significant financial and social costs across the life cycle of an individual.<\/p> <p> The fluoride added to our water supplies is in the form of hydrofluosilicic acid and is in compliance with the specifications for that substance, which are set out in the 2007 regulations.  This issue was raised by Senator Keane.  It is sourced as a primary product in Spain, mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar.  It then goes through a purification process to produce the acid.  Representatives of the expert body on fluorides and health conducted a site visit to Spain and were satisfied that the production is in compliance with the quality, environmental and safety systems and procedures in place and that the company, Derivados del Fluor, strives to ensure these systems and procedures are maintained and continually reviewed.<\/p><p> It is sometimes claimed that the product used in Ireland is a waste product from the fertiliser industry; this is not the case.  Others issues such as the toxicity or corrosiveness of the product are also raised from time to time.  These issues only apply to the raw undiluted acid and necessitate great care and suitable safety precautions for those handling it.  When added to water in the correct amount, the acid dissociates or separates completely releasing fluoride ions into the water and is not toxic or corrosive.<\/p><p> A code of practice has been produced by the expert body with the support and co-operation of organisations such as the local authorities, Environmental Health Officers Association, Health and Safety Authority, EPA, HSE and others.  The purpose of the code is to ensure the proper implementation by all personnel involved of the procedures for the fluoridation of the public water supplies to the prescribed standards and to minimise the risk of injury or damage to plant, personnel and environment.  The code does not modify or set aside in any way, the obligations or requirements of the operator of the water treatment plant under other legislation such as health and safety statues.  The code applies to all water treatment plants where the fluoridation of water supplies is, or will be, carried out.  The expert body will continually review this code of practice.  The legislation on water fluoridation requires that a daily test be carried out at water treatment plants by the local authority water services staff.  Monthly fluoride testing is carried out by the HSE and the EPA also carries out testing which requires monitoring of fluoride levels in water supplies.  If the fluoride levels are found to be outside the range specified in the legislation, those responsible are notified, prompt adjustments are made to the dosing equipment and a new test carried out.<\/p><p> All EU states have fluoride, in one form or another, at the centre of their public policy approach.  For some European countries, water fluoridation is impracticable due to the large number of separate water sources.  Many of them choose salt fluoridation or milk fluoridation as an alternative to give the health benefits of fluoride exposure to their citizens.  Several countries have opted to use other approaches to fluoridation such as in investing in large public dental services, as in Holland and the Nordic countries.  In such cases, fluoride is administered to children in school clinics.  This would require a significant investment in personnel and resources in Ireland.  Water fluoridation is the most cost-effective method of preventing dental decay and thus overcoming the poor risk profile in Ireland.  There is evidence also that other methods of fluoridation such as milk fluoridation or topical applications are not as clinically effective.  There is also evidence that water fluoridation may have particular advantages for persons on lower income.<\/p><p> Major fluoridating countries include the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Israel, Singapore, Hong Kong, Colombia and Chile.  Fluoridation coverage in the USA increased by approximately 24 million people between 2002 and 2012 and population coverage in Australia also increased in 2012.  Almost 5.8 million people in the UK have fluoride added to their water and another 330,000 have naturally fluoridated water.  Approximately 10% of the population in Spain have fluoridated water.  Salt fluoridation is practised in many South and Central American countries and also in the EU, notably in France, Germany and other central European states.<\/p><p> Water fluoridation is one of the most widely studied public health policy initiatives in the world.  The design and evidence is poor in some studies but the expert body only considers scientific evidence that has been peer reviewed and approved for publication in recognised scientific journals.  Studies in Ireland and worldwide have found that water fluoridation has a significant benefit for dental health among both children and adults.  Persons residing in fluoridated areas have better teeth with less disease than those residing in non-fluoridated areas.  For example, in the last all-Ireland study conducted in 2001-02, there were approximately 40% fewer cavities in children living in fluoridated areas.  Ireland is among the worst countries in Europe for high frequency consumption of sweets and confectionery by children and adolescents.  Our children and adolescents have generally poor tooth brushing habits compared to their European counterparts.  Accordingly, the use of fluoridated toothpastes alone is insufficient to prevent tooth decay.<\/p><p> The Health Research Board has recently approved funding for a study to be led by the Oral Health Services Research Centre of University College Cork and the Department of Health is a collaborator in the study.  The study entitled, What Impact Have Major Policy Changes Had on Oral Health in Ireland? Establishing a Blueprint for Oral Health Surveillance, will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to fluoride toothpaste use for infants and young children in 2002 and the reduced level of fluoridation in drinking water since 2007.  Surveys on children's and adults oral health have been conducted on a regular basis to measure the effectiveness of water fluoridation in the State.  These include national studies in 1984, 1990, 2001 and 2002, regional studies between 1990 and 1999 and a cross-Border study in 2006.   All these studies showed a substantial benefit in terms of the reduction in tooth decay experience.  The expert body is unaware of convincing scientific evidence to the contrary in Ireland.<\/p><p> I wish to emphasise the main issues are that use of fluoridated water has a substantial benefit for oral health over and above the use of fluoridated toothpaste; water fluoridation is the most cost-effective method of preventing tooth decay and overcoming the high risk of dental caries in the Irish population given our dietary habits, which include consuming a large volume of confectionery and fizzy drinks, regrettably, and generally poor tooth brushing habits; there is evidence that water fluoridation has particular advantages for reducing dental health inequalities for persons on lower income; and our water fluoridation systems are subject to ongoing quality assurance to ensure compliance with legislation and standards.<\/p><p> I draw the attention of Senators to additional studies that are publicly available, including a position paper from the expert body published on its website in 2012.  It is essentially a survey and it does not purport to pull together all the material and evidence.  It offers an important and timely survey of the current position on water fluoridation and the views and the conclusion of the expert body.  It is very much up to date and it has the benefit of analysing reviews conducted in a considerable number of countries in recent years such as the York review of 2000 to 2002 in England, Australia in 2008, Canada in 2010 and the US in 2006.  None of these reviews has established a basis for considering that artificially fluoridated water poses systemic health risks.  The position paper also deals with report of the EU scientific committee on health and environmental risks.  The expert body report is up to date and concludes that:<blockquote>There continues to be overwhelming evidence that water fluoridation significantly benefits dental health.  The expert body is satisfied having studied current peer reviewed scientific evidence worldwide that water fluoridation does not cause any ill-effects and continues to be safe and effective.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>The expert body is satisfied, having studied current peer reviewed scientific evidence worldwide, that water fluoridation does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective.  Senator C\u00e1it Keane raised a fair question on public information.  There is also to be found on the website a document with which we are all familiar nowadays, FAQs, frequently asked questions, which appears to turn up everywhere.  A list of 25 frequently asked questions is available which deal in some detail with some of the issues Senators have raised, including Senator C\u00e1it Keane who asked what additives are used to fluoridate Irish drinking water the acid concerned, which I will not attempt to pronounce, and its source.  The science surrounding the entire issue is broken down and explained in clear terms in the frequently asked questions document.<\/p><p>The report to which Senators have referred, which was prepared by Mr. Waugh, has been considered.  I do not want Members to go away from the debate with the view that the Government, the Department or the expert group close their eye to documents, submissions or interventions that, for some reason, go against the grain.  These documents are read.  I have read Mr. Waugh's report.  The expert group has read his report and has published, again on the website, a detailed response dealing with each of the issues raised by Mr. Waugh.  He raised some issues in respect of what he regards as legal objections.  They are disposed of very clearly in the expert group's response.  The European Commission has addressed any concerns that may arise in respect of any suggestion that the policy runs counter to EU directives.  It does not and the view of the European Commission in that regard is set out very carefully in the expert group report.  There is no legal impediment either as a matter of Irish law - that has been the case for almost 50 years - or as a matter of European Union law to a water fluoridation policy.<\/p><p>In regard to the alleged adverse health affects, I have read Mr. Waugh's report.  I am a lay person in this regard; I am not a scientist.  Even in those circumstances, one has to look for the evidence for some of the assertions made in that report.  I can only rely on the expert group's responses where it states in respect of Mr. Waugh's report that the author does not include in the document the many reports and reviews from respected international agencies confirming that there are no known adverse affects on health from fluoridation.  If a member of the public, including Mr. Waugh, or a Member of the House brings forward a report in good faith - I do not suggest anything other than good faith on his part - we would have an expectation that a scientific report would at least have regard to other evidence.  The lifeblood of scientific research is that one puts forward one's own hypothesis but one must have regard to the evidence against and one has to weigh up the issue.  The author, Mr. Waugh, might well say it was not his job to look at all the other evidence but it is our job to weigh up the evidence and what is being said and to examine the science.  The question we have to ask is not if there are objections or if some people are unhappy or if some people have campaigned against it in good faith but what is the preponderance of the evidence as we weigh it up.  Let us look at the evidence we are given and the studies done and at the conclusions drawn from those studies.  I accept what Senator Norris said about the importance of this kind of public health policy being kept under review.  That is why the amendment to the motion notes that it should be and is kept under review.  However, I do not accept that there is a sufficiency of evidence or objection that could conceivably persuade the House that it should seek to change it or draw it into question, which a call for a review on its own does.  The point was made by Senator John Gilroy that language is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000023#W00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359549600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Nuance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000026#Z00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1359549600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>A simple bald call for a review in the manner in which the motion is drawn gives rise to the suggestion, if not the conclusion, that there is a problem with the policy.

Like many other members I have been inundated with representations on the issue through e-mail and face-to-face representation in recent months.  This debate is an opportunity to clarify where we stand on the issue and debunk the myths.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for his excellent response in which he dealt with the issue in great detail.  As there are genuine concerns on the issue, an informed discussion is the only way forward.  The Minister of State has clearly outlined that the levels of fluoride in Irish water are provided for optimal protection for the oral health of all the people.  That is the safest and most cost-effective way of doing this.  It strengthens our teeth and helps reduce the level of dental care.  Just as important, it provides universal assistance to people who may not have the financial resources to deal with dental difficulties.  The fluoridation of water provides protection for oral health.  If such a method was available to the State to protect against, say, cancer, arthritis or diabetes, there would be no hesitation in using it.  Water fluoridation provides mass protection and is supported by the World Health Organization and, as the Minister of State has outlined, it is supported by many countries across the globe.<\/p><p>In regard to the danger of over-exposure, it is ironic that when some people spoke to me about fluoridation of water, they said they had to buy bottled water.  However, the reality is that there is as much fluoride in bottled water as there is in tap water.  The myths need to be debunked.  Fluoridation levels are tested daily.  As a former member of a local authority I am aware that in my local town a particular system is in place, as in most local authority areas.  In the event of a difficulty arising with the levels of fluoride, the matter is addressed immediately.  The fluoridation levels are tested every month, notwithstanding the requirement of the local authority under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, and also on a monthly basis by the EPA.<\/p><p>Fluoridation is doing a good job.  There is no need for concern in respect of this matter.  It is important that we have had a debate as the genuine concerns I have received needed a discussion to clarify the issues.

There have been some strong reviews.  A comprehensive review was established by a Fianna F\u00e1il Minister for Health and Children and reported in 2002.  Even after public consultation and taking on board all the evidence, it concluded that water fluoridation has been effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially that of children, and that human health is not adversely affected.  Other colleagues have already said - I do not want to repeat it - that children in Ireland have a very high rate of consumption of sugary foods and sweetened drinks.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, the Irish population has relatively poor dietary and oral hygiene practices and water fluoridation has been effective in preventing dental suffering and pain, and indeed other things such as infections and other health risks that poor dental hygiene can bring about.<\/p><p>It is useful for us to debate this and consider the arguments made in Declan Waugh's report - I know the Minister of State has addressed those.  We need to consider the appraisal of those arguments and the answers given.  We need to assess the scientific evidence on the matter.  Having carried out that exercise very usefully in this session and being aware that a comprehensive review was carried out in the relatively recent past, we should conclude it is safe to support the Government's amendment to the motion.<\/p><p>The issue of language is important.  Senator Norris has very carefully and correctly simply called for a review.  However, even calling for a review can open the question, as Senator Gilroy and others have said, and perhaps contribute to fears that are unjustified when one considers the evidence.

It reminds me of my good friend Kieran Hickey who made a film about Joyce using the glass slides from the Lawrence collection and he was refused permission to do so by the National Library of Ireland on the grounds that it was not possible.  He said: \"Since it is not possible, I couldn't be doing it, so let's go ahead and do it\", and they did.  That kind of circular reasoning is being applied here.  If we are prepared to review it, why should we be so shy of even opening the question?<\/p><p>I will not have time to put on record the very strong rhetoric of senior Fine Gael politicians when this matter first came up.

I am putting one side because it has been so underrepresented.  I do so because I believe in getting at the truth whatever it is.  I recognise that I am sacrificing a significant section of my vote, but I have always been prepared to take that type of risk because it is important that we see the result.<\/p><p>I am concerned about what happened to the report prepared very expertly containing page after page of shortlisted references of a very high scientific level, including a number of Nobel Prize-winning scientists by Mr. John Gormley.  That report, which was agreed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, was buried.  That worries me because it does not sound like dialogue at all.  It was never published and was rejected by the then Minister.  An undertaking was given that there would be reviews and that the HSE would undertake a national study to determine the total fluoride intake of individuals.  I am not aware that that has been done - I do not believe it has.  If it has been done, it has not been published.<\/p><p>I am also concerned that of the 15 meetings of the original body charged by the Government to investigate this in the 1960s - I believe - some 14 disappeared, which is odd.  There is a trail of curious things.  I am not a conspiracy theorist.  I certainly do not believe that fluoridation was a communist plot and referring to this did not add anything to the debate.  I have scrupulously attempted to avoid any type of witch hunt or unduly alarming people.  It was necessary that we had that.  I compliment all my colleagues and friends on the way in which they handled this matter.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is correct in stating that since about 2000 this material has been sourced in Spain.  However, before that it came from a Dutch industrial plant.  It is not pure fluoride but hexafluorosilicic acid, which is registered as a serious toxin.  Senator Barrett made an excellent contribution on which I compliment and thank him.  I do not entirely agree with it.  I believe he was gilding the lily somewhat when he said that one would need to ingest humanly impossible amounts of fluoride in order to do oneself any damage.

On Second Stage I expressed my full support for the Bill and the amendments I have tabled are to strengthen it further.  The Bill brings Ireland in line with the rest of its EU partners and the vast majority of the Council of Europe states.  It is a mark of a fair, just and compassionate society to have arrangements in law that allow for individuals to put their offending past behind them and move forward with a clean slate.  It is in everybody's interest to facilitate and encourage the rehabilitation and reintegration of former offenders into society.  My only concern, which my amendments are intended to remedy, is that the Bill, even with the Government amendments, which I take it will be supported and all of which I welcome, is still too restrictive and too conservative to fulfil its purpose.<\/p><p>  I will begin by noting that I have no difficulty in supporting a further increase in the maximum limit of sentence to which the spent conviction regime will apply.  The &quot;30 months&quot; amendment being put forward by my Sinn F\u00e9in colleagues has merit.  A review in 2011 of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 by the Ministry of Justice in the United Kingdom judged the limit of 30 month sentences to be too restrictive.<\/p> <p>In response the UK Government, through the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 has reformed the relevant sections of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act by setting the limit at 48 months.  This is four times the limit proposed in the Bill.<\/p><p>The UK has a 40 year head start on us with regard to spent convictions legislation.  This is not something it has come up with because of five years' experience.  After 40 years it has increased the limited to 48 months.  During this time the Ministry of Justice in the UK strived to strike the appropriate balance between public safety and reducing barriers to integration for those who have moved on from offending behaviour.  We have an opportunity to capitalise on the learning in the UK with the legislation before us.<\/p><p>I support my colleagues in Sinn F\u00e9in, whose amendment proposes to extend the limit to 30 months and this keeps with the minimum extension sought by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  I would have preferred to propose 48 months but I thought I would try to strike a middle ground, which is why the amendment proposes two years as a compromise between the 12 months in the Bill which is extremely restricted and prohibitive and the 48 months which has grown out of trust after 40 years of legislation in the UK.  I believe two years strikes a good balance as we start out on this journey of recognising spent convictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000028#BB02100","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359551400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important legislation which, as Senator van Turnhout stated, will be supported from all quarters in the House even if we have amendments which seek to strengthen it.  On Second Stage I gave a very broad welcome to the Bill because regardless of the differences we may have with regard to its limitations we should all see it as part of a package of measures which is necessary to integrate prisoners back into society and into employment, which is important.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for a non-disclosure regime whereby certain convictions are considered spent or do not have to be disclosed to a prospective employer after a period of conviction-free living.  The time limit is 12 months and I share the concern expressed by Senator van Turnhout that the Bill is a little too conservative.  In his Second Stage contribution, the Minister stated the Bill was liberal.  I do not believe it is and I agree with many of the concerns expressed by the Irish Penal Reform Trust that at a minimum the time limit should be 30 months.  Although our amendments reflect the 30 months which, as Senator van Turnhout stated, was the middle ground, I understand my party colleague in the D\u00e1il, our spokesperson on justice, Deputy P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn, will seek an extension to 48 months.  We must listen to what the Minister of State has to say today and hear her arguments.<\/p><p>  When the 2007 Bill was presented to the D\u00e1il we and the Labour Party criticised its conservatism.  The Minister and the Government have substantially improved it and this should be acknowledged.  However, we still believe it is too restrictive and the time limits should be increased.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust recommends a minimum of 30 months and has stated its preference for 48 months as is the case in the UK.  We should look at international best practice.  I do not always believe we must look elsewhere, whether to the North, the UK or anywhere else, to see what we should do here, but in this area we should examine what is best practice throughout Europe.  From the research we have done it appears a period of 12 months is too restrictive and we should consider 30 months.<\/p><p>  One of the submissions made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust included a contribution from an individual which may add value to the debate.  The person stated:<blockquote>I would like to do various jobs in my chosen area but cannot even apply for a lot of positions due to my previous conviction.  I feel as though I have given a lot back to society, now live a respectable crime free life and also wish to gain employment but am unable to do so.  This is partly due to the current economic crisis but largely due to the fact that my conviction will be with me for life.  The stigma of the conviction will hang over me for the rest of my life and no amount of voluntary work or academic success will ever change that.<\/blockquote>This is an example of the type of person we are trying to support, help and encourage back into society to reintegrate and get back to employment.  The Bill is our opportunity to make the right decisions and correct much of the conservatism and restrictive nature of existing law.  We must strike the appropriate balance, which to be fair is what is being sought.  I have made the arguments.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 tabled by Sinn F\u00e9in are essentially the same.  I will not make the arguments again other than to encourage the Minister of State to listen to what is being said.  I have spoken to many organisations and individuals responsible for integrating prisoners back into society and they are also of the view that a 12 month period is too restrictive.  This is our position and I am interested to hear the response of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000029#CC00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359551400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  On Second Stage I spoke to support the concept of the Bill.  My party and the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, did much preparatory work on it.  I rise to speak very briefly in support of the amendments in the names of Senator van Turnhout and Sinn F\u00e9in.  The Government is erring on the side of caution in the Bill.  It is being overcautious with regard to the 12 month period.  The thrust of our criminal and penal system is rehabilitation.  If we can save 5% of the souls who go through our criminal justice system and rehabilitate them so they can start a new life, as outlined in the account read by Senator Cullinane, it would be a great step.<\/p><p>I was fortunate to visit, along with other members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, the open prison system in Finland to see how it deals with crime, prison and restorative justice.  It has a similar population to Ireland and has 1,000 fewer people in prison.  Its open prison system is something we should examine more closely as is the way those interested in reforming their lives and rehabilitation can go back to college.  The concept pursued in particular by the former Minister, Michael McDowell, of building a superprison to lock everybody up might give the notion to society that we are tackling crime, but in effect building extra prison spaces goes in the wrong direction.  It is like some of the work done by the Minister of State in the area of mental health.  It was a very brave decision to place people in communities rather than in grey forlorn terrible buildings sometimes for years on end.  We are making progress; it is not a utopia but we are going in the right direction.  In this regard I support the previous speakers on the thrust of their debate.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout seeks a period of two years.  There should be consensus and a middle ground.  Perhaps the guillotine should not be brought down on this aspect of the legislation as it might be worth considering on Report Stage.  Almost everybody who has spoken on the Bill in the House is primarily in agreement with the thrust of the legislation.  The idea of the Bill is a great concept and I am also of this view.  We are being overcautious and we should be a little braver.

I also apologise for missing the Minister of State's opening comments.  When will the Bill be enacted?  I know of a family that has been devastated by a spent conviction not being eradicated.  It is a very small public order offence that the then 19 year old son acquired.  When he was 30 years old he applied for a visa to Canada to practice his new career but was refused due to the outstanding conviction.  He simply kicked a football across a roundabout late at night but the garda\u00ed saw him and the matter led to a court case.  He said nothing to his family and paid a fine but ten years later the matter came back to haunt him.  It is not a prison sentence but a public order offence.  It may have been the result of the folly of youth, freakish or accidental.<\/p><p>I wish to note that there is a difference between categories of convictions.  I concur with comments made by Senator O'Donovan about the appropriateness of sentences and the rehabilitation of prisoners.  He also wondered if we rehabilitate prisoners appropriately.  I disagree with the idea of super-prisons.  It is much more important to have early intervention at community level.  If one asks people who work with children from a young age they will say that they know who will be in trouble later.  When Sally Shields was president of the Irish National Teachers Organisation in 1996, she put a similar statement on record.  There is a pattern when it comes to families that get into difficulty early.  When there was a crime outbreak in Limerick, I remember a mother who said that her son, who went on to offend, hung a greyhound on a gate when he was eight years of age.  There definitely is a pattern so we must invest in early intervention.  Obviously my comments are unrelated to the Bill but still are relevant.  I want prisoners to be rehabilitated appropriately to ensure they do not reoffend when released.<\/p><p>The percentage of re-offending is extremely high here.  I examined the figures some time ago but I cannot repeat them.  However, the statistics show that the prison format does not work adequately.  Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us the timeframe for the Bill and when it will be enacted.  That would be most welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000030#DD00100","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1359552000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I welcome the evolving debate but much of what has been raised by previous speakers is more substantive than the amendments.  We are putting in place a new concept.  Like all legislation one does not necessarily get it right the first time around.  The proposal of a spent conviction facility is a new departure and will make a genuine difference to many people.  Senator Healy Eames mentioned one case.  At Christmas I had a query from a young gentleman who was convicted for stealing a bag of chips.  The conviction caused him problems when it came to gaining employment.  I hope that the matter can be resolved.<\/p><p>I will take my counsel from the Minister of State once she replies, as we have to do politically on this side of the House.  At a minimum we should say to our colleagues who tabled the amendments and other interested parties that the legislation, both here and in the other House, is not a tablet of stone but is open to review.  If in 18 months, two years or three years the legislation is found to be good but not as good as it could or might be, we could reflect further on the timeframes.<\/p><p>To go from no spent conviction to a four year proposal is a jump too far here in this cautious place of legislative progress.  However, it is difficult to dismiss what Senator van Turnhout has said about the two year period.  I shall wear my Government side of the House cap again and say that I will listen to the Minister of State but we must we willing to progress the matter further.  It was interesting to hear the comments made by my colleagues on Finland.  They are lucky to have travelled there.<\/p><p>We need to debate law and order and prison policy but we only do that when there is a crisis after a major crime outrage.  I am not talking about the recent tragedy where a garda was murdered.  Following an increase in robberies we usually have a debate on crime and the resultant analysis is to throw away the key.  On other occasions we reflect on the Finnish or other systems.  Such a rolling debate needs to take place in a calmer environment.  The statistics show that there is a high rate of re-offending in Ireland which is proof that the prison system needs to be amended.  Today we are dealing with the singular issue of a spent conviction.  I hope that the Minister of State will respond generously to the amendment, particularly to the cautious amendment tabled by Senator van Turnhout.  I am not saying that Senator Cullinane's amendment is wild but we cannot go from zero to four years in one move.

The Department hopes the Bill will be enacted as soon as possible and no one wishes to delay it.<\/p><p>I will read out the lengthy official response as it explains the reasoning behind the Government's position.  As Senator Bradford has rightly pointed out, the proposal is not entirely new.  The rest of civilised society has it and we have waited a long time for it.  I am glad to know that nobody has seriously objected to the provisions.  The comments have been recorded by my officials.  The Bill as published has been substantially amended and I shall get to that later on.  I know the Minister is open to the type of interaction that occurs when debating legislation.<\/p><p>The Government has given a lot of consideration to the length of custodial sentences to be covered by the Bill.  This arises in the definition of &quot;excluded sentence&quot; where we exclude sentences above a certain length, and in the definition of a &quot;relevant custodial sentence&quot; where the Bill lists the range of custodial sentences covered by legislation.<\/p><p>As Members will know, the United Kingdom has recently amended its legislation to provide that sentences of up to four years are covered by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.  Some say that should be the benchmark for us when devising our scheme.  Senator van Turnhout and Sinn F\u00e9in have settled on two years and 30 months, respectively.<\/p> <p>It is worth saying that the UK legislation is now probably the most liberal in the common law world.  Meanwhile, what we are proposing, compared to Australia and New Zealand, is at the more liberal end of the spectrum.  In most Australian states, only prison sentences of six months or less are covered, while in New Zealand no one who is sentenced to imprisonment can benefit from their corresponding legislation.  It is worth recalling also that the genesis of this legislation was the highly regarded Law Reform Commission report on spent convictions.  The report recommended that only sentences of six months or less should be covered.<\/p><p> In preparing the legislation the Government decided to go the extra mile and cover sentences of up to 12 months.  However, the Government is not prepared to go further than this.  The 12-month cut-off covers almost 90% of all custodial sentences handed down by the courts in Ireland.  That is worth keeping in mind.  By any yardstick a regime that allows that proportion of custodial sentences to become spent is generous.<\/p><p> It is for these reasons that the Government is not in a position to accept Senator van Turnhout's amendments Nos. 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 15, which seek to increase the length of custodial sentence covered by the Bill to two years.  Nor can we accept Sinn F\u00e9in's amendments Nos. 4 and 6, which seek to increase the length of custodial sentence covered by the legislation from the 12 months contained in the Bill to 30 months.<\/p><p> The length of sentence covered by this legislation must be balanced by the length of time that a person must remain conviction free before a conviction becomes spent.  We will be discussing Government amendments shortly that significantly reduce the waiting period in the Bill.  That is where the Government has decided to adjust the balance in the Bill.  The Government is satisfied that taking together the length of sentence covered and the waiting period, the scheme represents a fair balance that will benefit the vast majority of offenders who want to get on with their lives.  <\/p><p> I take on board what Senators Cullinane and Healy Eames have said.  We have all had experience of people not being able to move on in their chosen professions or to emigrate.<\/p><p> As regards Government amendments Nos. 5 and 17, having reviewed the sentences covered by the Bill and having considered various representations made, the Minister has decided to amend the provisions concerning suspended sentences to provide that sentences of up to 24 months, which are suspended in whole, and while the suspension is not subsequently revoked, are covered by the legislation.  Therefore, people who get a suspended sentence of 24 months will now be covered.  We are doing this primarily to recognise that suspended sentences should be distinguished from custodial sentences.<\/p><p> The Bill, as published, treats a suspended sentence of more than 12 months the same as a custodial sentence of more than 12 months.  In limiting the length of suspended sentences to two years, the Government is conscious that the length of a sentence is intended to reflect the gravity of the offence, and that sentences may be suspended for a variety of reasons that do not take away from the seriousness of the crime.  To give effect to the change in the approach to suspended sentences, amendment No. 5 amends the definition of &quot;excluded sentence&quot; to remove the reference to suspended sentences.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 17 is both a Government amendment and an amendment put forward by Senator van Turnhout.  It seeks to amend paragraph (<i>a<\/i>) of the definition of &quot;non-custodial sentences&quot; to increase the length of suspended sentence covered by the Bill from 12 to two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000030#DD00500","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359552600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

The Minister of State's response reflects what was said at second stage about the vast majority of sentences being covered.  We all very much welcome the increase to 12 months, given that the Law Reform Commission recommended a much more conservative sentence length of six months.<\/p><p>I am pleased to see in the Government schedule that the waiting period will be reduced.

In particular, where somebody is sentenced to six months or less it will go down from five to four years, and in the case of 12 months or less it will go down from six to five years.  That is of practical import to people.

I found myself agreeing with almost all of what Senator Bradford said in his thoughtful contribution.  The approach that is being taken - and Senator Bradford's contribution is a manifestation of it, in some respects - is a little bit too cautious.  I want to restate the position because we need to reduce reoffending.  I think we would all accept that, but this measure is only one part of it.  There is much we must do within the prison system itself.  There are many sitting and former prison governors who have progressive views on what should happen.  They would also see this as just part of the process, albeit an important one.<\/p><p>I cited the example of an individual who was involved in community work.  He was a community leader who graduated from college and runs a skills course for young offenders.  That was the individual I cited in terms of that contribution.  It demonstrates the issues which exist there.  Striking a balance is very important.  If we are too conservative we will end up fixing the problem for the person who stole a bag of chips or the young person who threw a football across a roundabout, but it does not fix many of the other problems concerning Senator Bradford's central point.  Those individuals were not in prison and will not be reoffending.  I want to encourage those people back into employment.  <\/p><p>I would like to put on the record some figures that demonstrate that having a conviction - even if it is an old one - does have an impact.  Studies have indicated that 48% of employers would not take on somebody with a criminal record.  The Small Firms' Association has indicated that between 76% and 87% of firms would not employ an ex-offender.  During a contribution on Second Stage, Senator Quinn - who has experience as an employer - also raised that concern.  <\/p><p>I appreciate the point made by Senator Bradford and the Government that this is a new departure.  Like any new departure, I agree with being cautious when we consider doing something new and different.  However, we may be just a little bit too cautious.  We can revisit this matter again but I think we are being overly cautious.  We will miss the point as regards the purpose of this Bill concerning people who have custodial sentences.  It will cover people up to a certain point in terms of 12-month convictions, but it will not cover people who might have a number of small offences and the combined total may be over 12 months.  Where does that leave them?  They may have committed a number of minor offences when they were in a particular phase of their lives when they were young.  They may have exceeded the 12 months but they are in a different place now.  That is the argument that has been made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.<\/p><p>In fairness, the current Minister for Justice and Equality has shown himself to be a liberal Minister who listens and engages with this House constructively on many Bills.

In addition, he does not assume that he knows all things or that no one else has reasonable or good suggestions and he has demonstrated this in what he has done.  I agree with Senator van Turnhout in respect of the recidivism issue and am glad she brought it up as after four years, there is very little of it.  However, people who come out of prison after a 12-month period and reoffend are not yet at a point in their lives at which they themselves are prepared to move on and this has absolutely nothing to do with a spent conviction.  Members are discussing a different category of individual and in some cases, such an individual is someone who did something very foolish, perhaps minor, at a certain point in their lives but who has not been able to move on thereafter.  I believe we are talking about two entirely different categories of people and this legislation is not set in stone - no legislation ever is.  Let us see how this legislation and other items of legislation work.  I am sure the Minister will take note of the comments made and will be in a position to respond on Report Stage.

We want to ensure the limitation on two convictions being classified as spent is removed. <\/p><p>  I referred earlier to someone who might have more than two convictions not being able to qualify for this.  A number of separate convictions may be recorded for one event, particularly when considered under the provision in section 2(2)(<i>e<\/i>) that only two convictions can be considered spent for any one individual.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust pointed in its submission that the operation of the system of prosecution of offences in Ireland means that often one act may constitute a number of different offences and, furthermore, a number of different but connected charges may be brought forward with regard to the same incident and the example was given of a public order and criminal damage offence, or driving without tax and other road traffic offences.<\/p><p>  The principle that any person who has demonstrated his or her good behaviour and character by the completion of a rehabilitation period should benefit from the proposed spent conviction regime is at the heart of the Bill before the House.  Anyone seeking to benefit from the scheme on more than two occasions would have qualified through lengthy rehabilitation periods on each occasion.  The IPRT sees no reason why in such exceptional circumstances an individual should not be able to benefit from the Bill on a third or subsequent occasion, given that previous convictions will have been taken into account at the point of sentence.<\/p><p>  The trust gives a human example, which is always the best way to give us a flavour of what sort of situations can arise.  It outlines how more than 30 years ago, when Conor was just over 18 years of age, he reversed into another car in the carpark of a local disco as he was leaving a dance.  He was uninsured and did not remain at the scene.  The damage was minor, he broke his rear lens and damaged the wing of the other person's car.  He fully compensated the other person but at court he was convicted on three charges: section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, failure to stop at the scene of an accident - three months disqualification; section 53 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, dangerous driving - the licence was endorsed; and section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, no insurance - the licence was endorsed.  He has only been in court once, as a defendant on this issue.  He said himself that because he had only one court appearance, albeit with three charges, he is being treated less favourably than someone who committed three separate offences.  He would be delighted if there was some extra recognition for someone who only had one court appearance or transgression in their entire lifetime.  Today he is a working PAYE employee of a large company and contributes to the local community through his work for the local group water scheme and other local bodies.  He is still, however, seen as a criminal as this Bill stands and that depresses him.<\/p><p>  That is a human example and it makes sense.  This is someone who was a victim of the fact that because of the legislation and the criminal act that covered the circumstances under which he found himself, there happened to be three separate convictions arising from just one incident.  He cannot have all of those convictions expunged if the Bill goes through.  It demonstrates the conservatism of the Bill and the technical issues that were not taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000033#GG00700","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359553800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>We agree on this issue.  The fact the new spent conviction arrangements would not apply to multiple convictions arising from a single offence or incident was raised on Second Stage.  Today's amendments Nos. 22 and 23 seek to address that.

I do not believe that is what the Minister intended and my amendment was submitted to avoid that unintentional pitfall.<\/p><p>  I am glad to see the Government itself recognises the need for clarity around the single incident, multiple conviction scenario.  I am happy to support the Government amendment but, with respect, I would like the Government to look at the wording in my amendment because, in this case, it is particularly good wording.

The Government has made it clear from the start that the legislation is aimed at the person who makes a mistake, perhaps in his youth, and who now wants to get on with his life.  There is no argument there.  It is not, however, a charter for criminality.  It is based on the premise that people deserve a second or third chance.  It does not envisage an open-ended, rolling spending of convictions throughout someone's life.  It is legislation for those people who contact our clinics every day who ran foul of the law in their youth and feel it has the potential to stand against them when looking for a job.  They want to put it behind them and the legislation is intended to assist those people.  They are not career criminals.<\/p><p>  Sinn F\u00e9in's amendment would not provide a deterrent to criminality but would, and I accept this is not the intention, hold out the prospect that no matter how often a person offends, a day will come in the future where his convictions will be spent.  That is not in the interest of the offender or society.<\/p><p>  We want people to stop committing crimes.  We do not want to see further re-offending and we want to assist in discouraging recidivism.  The limit on the number of convictions that can become spent makes a positive contribution to rehabilitation and reintegration.  It is for those reasons that the Government cannot accept the amendment to remove the cap on the number of convictions that may become spent under the Bill.<\/p><p>  Government amendment No. 22 makes an exception to the two conviction rule and Senator van Turnhout has also tabled an amendment to this effect.  A person can be convicted of more than one offence at one sitting of the court but section 2(2)(<i>e<\/i>) of the Bill provides that a person can have no more than two spent convictions.  Situations arise, however, quite regularly where a number of convictions are handed down at one court sitting related to disparate aspects of one incident.  A person who comes to the notice of the garda\u00ed while intoxicated may be charged with and convicted of a number of public order offences.  Equally, a person may be convicted of a number of road traffic offences related to one encounter with the garda\u00ed.  The intent of the two conviction rule in section 2(2)(<i>e<\/i>) is to allow someone to have two chances.  Without this amendment, for many people the Act would not provide even one chance as they would have to declare a third and subsequent conviction for the same offence, thus making largely irrelevant the non-disclosure of the two spent convictions.  Senator van Turnhout's amendment No. 23 has the same intent as the Government amendment and I hope she will support it.  The amendment allows that in the event all of the convictions are handed down in one sitting, they are treated as one conviction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000033#GG00900","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1359553800,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I listened to the Minister of State's response and will withdraw amendment No. 21 to give us time to reflect on her remarks and to come back with an amendment that might better reflect my contribution.

I think most people will welcome that.<\/p><p>It is important to put this into context.  The most widely employed criminal sanction in our judicial system is the fine.  The average fine handed down by the courts in Ireland is \u20ac300 while half are less than \u20ac200.  The overwhelming majority of fines are for less than \u20ac5,000.  The reduction in the relevant period for fines of less than \u20ac5,000 means that for the vast majority of people convicted in Irish courts, their convictions will be spent after two years.<\/p> <p>The opportunity presented by the change to the maximum waiting period is being availed of to reduce the number of different classifications of sentences for the purpose of Schedule 2, where custodial sentences and fines are concerned.  In the case of fines, there are only two categories, above and below a class A fine, currently &#8364;5,000 in the case of custodial sentence.  There are also two categories, above and below six months.  The change in relevant periods is a major change in the provisions of the Bill.  It is a change that is consistent with the Government's general approach to this legislation, which is to make it as accessible as possible and to the benefit of the greatest number of people.  No one would argue that a waiting period of two years from the date of a conviction for a community service order imposed instead of a prison sentence of up to six months is excessive or punitive.  Indeed, it is worth contrasting the proposal here for a four year waiting period for a six month sentence with the Law Reform Commission's proposal for a seven year waiting period for the same sentence and the ten year waiting period in operation in Australia.  <\/p><p> The descriptions of community service orders at paragraphs 5 and 6 of Part 2 of Schedule 2 are amended to take account of the changes already made to the definition of &quot;relevant non-custodial sentences&quot;.  I hope it is clear that a lot of thought has gone into devising a balanced proposal <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i>both the length of sentence covered by the Bill and the associated relevant periods.  I also hope it is clear that the Minister has taken on board many of the comments made in this House and elsewhere and has significantly amended the Bill in the context of suspended sentences and waiting periods.<\/p><p> Senator van Turnhout's proposed amendment No. 34 obviously reflects her earlier amendments designed to increase the length of sentence covered by the Bill.  I hope she will agree that the Minister's amendments move the Bill a long way towards her position and, in some cases, for example, where a six-month sentence is imposed, there is an overlap between her position and that of the Government.  Having said that, given that her earlier amendments on the length of sentences to be covered by the Bill were not accepted, it is not possible to accept her amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000035#JJ02700","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359555600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  Obviously, the overall rationale for my amendment is that the original rehabilitative periods put forward in this Bill of five to seven years for relevant custodial sentences and three to five years for relevant non-custodial sentences were too long.  The Government's own amendment, which reduces these periods to four to five years and two to four years, respectively, is very welcome but in my opinion is too conservative.  Nevertheless, I welcome these changes and am supportive of them.<\/p><p>I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention, once again, to the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the publication of the Bill which sets out the main purpose of the Bill as being &quot;to assist the rehabilitation of offenders, who often experience difficulties securing employment as a result of having a conviction&quot;.  In order to achieve this objective, the Bill must be as generous as possible.  To be generous does not mean being soft on crime in any way, although some members of the Government may believe that a less restrictive and less conservative law might be seen thus.  It would show foresight and an appreciation of the long-term societal benefits of encouraging the rehabilitation and the reintegration of ex-offenders into society.  A less restrictive spent convictions regime, negating as far as possible against the negative, far-reaching and often discriminatory consequences for ex-offenders and their families would also reflect the qualities, in Irish society, of compassion and forgiveness.<\/p><p>I am very aware of research conducted by the UK Home Office into re-conviction rates which suggests that if an individual has not re-offended in the first two years post-conviction, he or she is at equal risk of future risk of future offending as an individual with no previous conviction.  That finding is in keeping with the fact that in the UK legislation, the conviction-free or rehabilitative period at the lowest end of the offending scale is actually two years.  Obviously, when I put forward my amendment I was hoping that my original amendments would be accepted, which they were not.

The Courts Service is embarking on a detailed evaluation of District Court locations and in County Cavan specifically, it is looking at Virginia and Ballyconnell.  In the event of a decision to close either of these venues, business will be moved to Cavan town.  I believe there were approximately 240 District Curt venues when the Courts Service was originally established in 1989.  There have been some court closures in the past and now it seems there will be more.  If the District Courts at Ballyconnell and Virginia are closed there will be a logistical expense involved in getting local garda\u00ed from their stations to Cavan town.  It will also mean that the garda\u00ed will be away from the communities in which they are based for longer periods of time.<\/p> <p>This was highlighted by a District Court judge.  There would also be listing problems in that logistical difficulties could emerge as a result of courts operating from the one venue, which could necessitate dedicated days being reserved for particular areas.  It is important that those who have to travel to courts from rural areas can do so and that they have access to justice.  <\/p><p>It is hard to understand the rationale for the closure of Virginia courthouse.  While there is a separate Garda division based in Bailieborough, a large number of big towns are being served by that catchment area.  In addition, as it is on the commuter belt there has been a large influx of people into the towns of Kingscourt, Bailieborough, Ballyjamesduff, Kilnaleck and Mullagh.  The courthouse was extensively renovated in 2009 and the number of cases taken there since its reopening have increased annually.  I understand that in 2011 alone approximately 3,000 cases were heard.  It is a busy courthouse, which is IT friendly, includes a consultation room and provides wheelchair access but does not have cells.  However, neither does the courthouse in Cavan, to which the service may be relocated.<\/p><p>I believe there is a disconnect between the Courts Service and Minister for Justice and Equality in terms of the review and the courts proposed to be closed.  The closure of these small rural courthouses, in particular Virginia courthouse, without the provision of adequate alternative services, other than relocating them to Cavan town, will be negative in terms of accessibility.  Common complaints in regard to previous closures include the significant expense and difficulty travelling to the nearest court, including the cost of petrol, in particular to Ballyconnell courthouse in respect of which public transport is limited and is not aligned with court opening hours, and that individuals attending courts may have to pay for accommodation and food and take time off work.  A direct consequence in some courthouses as a result is that defendants are not turning up for hearings, resulting in adjournments and the expense of further arrangements.  The reduction in access to justice by way of closure of some of these District Court courthouses is not the best way to improve justice outcomes in the communities concerned.  Access to courts is essentially access to justice.  The vulnerable communities served by these courts need access to justice to ensure confidence in the system.<\/p><p>I have seen the criteria being used in terms of the review.  I am concerned about the closure of the District Court in Virginia in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000036#KK02000","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359556200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is unable to be here today and has asked me to convey his thanks to the Senator for raising the matter.<\/p><p>The Minister appreciates the concern of people, especially legal practitioners, in relation to closure of smaller court venues.  However, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of courts is the responsibility of the service and the Minister has no role in this decision.  The 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions which, of course, include the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings.  In the current financial climate the service has been obliged to review all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country, with the specific objective of ensuring that it can continue to maintain the delivery of frontline court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  The Minister has been informed that no court venue has been singled out or indeed exempted from the review process.  A comprehensive review of all venues has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure, taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of holding cell facilities, etc.  The likely impact on other justice agencies, such as An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account. <\/p><p>The Minister is informed that the review identified a range of venues nationwide which based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure, subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue.  It is worth noting that since its establishment in 1999, the Courts Service has amalgamated over 150 venues while, at the same time, the service has benefited from a very substantial capital investment to upgrade larger county town courthouses, including in Cavan town.  The policy has been very successful, resulting in a more efficient use of time for the Judiciary, court users and garda\u00ed.  Rather than short sittings in the smaller venues, a full day's list can be dealt with which leads to reductions in delays in the District Court.<\/p><p>The Senator has inquired about courthouses in Cavan in particular.  The service has stated that two venues in County Cavan, Ballyconnell and Virginia, have been identified as venues that should be considered for closure, subject to a detailed assessment and, as mentioned, the preparation of a business case.  The standard courthouse requirements includes basic facilities such as consultation rooms, victim support facilities and holding cells for prisoners which are essential to ensure public safety and efficient use of Irish Prison Service resources.  It should also be noted that the service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close, as each identified venue will be subject to a rigorous examination. <\/p><p>I can confirm that the Courts Service board will take no decision on the future of either Ballyconnell or Virginia as District Court venues without full prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.  I am informed that the consultation process in respect of both venues commenced on 7 January 2013, with a closing date for submissions on Friday, 4 February.  The service has assured the Minister that the views expressed in the process will be taken into account in the decision-making process.  However, as stated, the final decision in this matter will be for the Courts Service board.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  I appreciate her interest in the administration of justice in County Cavan.  I know that she will understand the need for the Courts Service to take the measures necessary to promote greater efficiency in the courts and I hope the constructive engagement involving the Courts Service will result in reasoned and appropriate decisions being made on the venues concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000037#LL00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Pornography","time":1359556200,"counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000037#LL00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1359556200,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this Adjournment matter.  In February last the Independent group tabled a Private Members' motion in the Seanad seeking to block child abuse material on the Internet, at which time the Minister for Justice and Equality gave a clear commitment that the matter would be fully considered in the context of the proposed Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.<\/p><p>I note from the Government's legislative programme for the spring session of 2013 that while publication of the Bill is expected in 2013 it is listed in section C, along with 12 other justice and equality Bills, as a Bill in respect of which the Heads have yet to be approved by the Government.  I am concerned the matter is not receiving the urgency I would like.  Furthermore, the impending transposition deadline of the 18 December 2013 for the relevant EU directive on the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography adds greater urgency to this debate.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware of a number of recent cases which highlighted the alarming and disturbing volume of child abuse material circulating within this jurisdiction.  One such Irish case pertains to a recent criminal prosecution for child pornography involving 135,555 images and videos showing severe child sex abuse in Ireland, including bondage, cruelty and bestiality.  A child abuse image is a crime scene.  It is a digital record of sexual abuse being perpetrated against a child.  Directive 2011\/92\/EU of the European Parliament and Council of 13 December 2011 combatting the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography and replacing the Council framework decision needs to be in place in Ireland by December 2013.  I refer the Minister of State to Article 25 of that directive.  Among the wide-ranging provisions in relation to criminal offences and sanctions in the area of sexual abuse and exploitation of children, the directive requires all EU member states to take the necessary measures to ensure the prompt removal of any web pages containing or disseminating child abuse material hosted on servers within their jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>With appropriate safeguards, the directive also permits member states to take measures to block access to Internet users within their territories of web pages containing or disseminating child abuse material hosted on servers outside their jurisdictions.  While Ireland has arrangements in place to secure the removal of child abuse material on domestic servers and to report materials found outside the jurisdiction via the INHOPE network, Ireland has not sanctioned a system that would allow the same material hosted overseas to be blocked where its removal proves difficult or takes an unreasonable length of time.<\/p><p>I put it to the Minister of State that, in transposing this EU directive, we have the opportunity to legislate for the blocking of child abuse material, bringing us into line with a number of our European partners - Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy, Malta, the UK and France, which has just passed legislation but does not yet have its provisions in place.  We need legislation and a victim identification database.  We must underpin existing measures to ensure the removal of material.  We must direct Irish Internet service providers to put in place a blocking system where removal proves difficult or is likely to take an unreasonable length of time.<\/p><p>I am conscious of my time.  The Minister for Justice and Equality's record on child protection is exemplary.  While he was in opposition, I had the pleasure to work with him on many issues in my role in an NGO.  However, the Internet service providers are lobbying strongly not to impose blocks.  Having considered the matter, I believe that we should block.  My purpose in raising this matter today is to give it urgency and to ensure that we block.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000037#LL00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359556800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>The Senator worked closely with the current Minister and I am glad that she recognises his commitment and that he is not someone who is easily swayed, regardless of the lobby group involved.<\/p><p>On the Minister's behalf, I thank the Senator for raising this most important and sensitive matter.  He recalls a useful debate in the House almost one year ago when the Senator last raised this topic.  She seeks an update on the progress being made in transposing Directive 2011\/92\/EU.<\/p><p>I have only a limited time available to me, but the Minister wanted to address an impression that may be conveyed by the opening lines of the motion.  They suggest there is a large quantity of child abuse material in circulation.  Of course, any quantity is too much, but the suggestion of large quantities is at variance with recent reports from Hotline.ie.  Its most recent annual report for 2011 indicated that the level of validated reports of illegal content remained modest, which the Minister understands continues to be the case.<\/p><p>We can be thankful that increased vigilance and surveillance have meant that the circulation of child abuse imagery has become less overtly visible on the Internet, although I am never sure about whether this is actually good.  There is less likelihood of the inadvertent viewing of such material by the general public.  It is well known that there are levels of circulation of such material that are not amenable to surveillance, but those involved are subject to regular targeting by crime prevention agencies, including the Garda.<\/p><p>Turning to the directive, the deadline for transposition is 18 December.  The Minister's Department has been conducting a review of the law on sexual offences generally.  This includes an examination of the measures required to implement a number of international legal instruments, one of those being the EU directive.  This work is close to completion and the Minister expects to bring a draft general scheme to the Government shortly for approval to have the necessary legislation drafted.  The Senator will appreciate that, until the proposals are considered by the Government, the Minister is constrained in what he can say concerning their precise content.  However, they will constitute wide-ranging legislation to implement the recommendations of two Oireachtas committees, facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of relevant EU, UN and Council of Europe instruments, reform the Sex Offenders Act 2001 and enhance the protection of children against sexual exploitation, including child pornography.<\/p><p>Regarding the specific issue of blocking of websites containing child pornography in accordance with Article 25, paragraph (2) of the directive, the Minister can inform the House that his officials are engaged in discussions with the Garda and representatives of the Internet service providers on this matter.  These are the key players in implementing any arrangement to give effect to that paragraph.  The Minister knows that they are fully committed to doing whatever is required to prevent the Internet from being used for the viewing and distribution of child pornography.  However, there is still some way to go in the current discussions and he is not in a position at this time to say definitively what measures can be put in place or their form.<\/p><p>As the Minister stated when the Seanad last debated this issue, the Internet is a global phenomenon, with no single organisation controlling it.  International co-operation is vital in combating illegal activities, particularly in view of the rapid rate of technological innovation.  The Minister is pleased that Ireland is one of 48 countries that signed the global alliance against child sexual abuse online, which was launched in December 2012.  This is a joint EU and US initiative and aims to reduce as much as possible the availability of child pornography online.  This is an example of how the international community can marshal its resources to defeat this heinous business.<\/p><p>I look forward to hearing from the Senators and will be paying close attention on behalf of the Minister to the opinions expressed.  It has always been my opinion that it is only with international co-operation that one can do anything about these issues.  We have the benefit of being a member state of the EU and we should use our membership to its fullest extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000038#MM00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1359556800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Next week will see the tenth annual safer Internet day.

Tomorrow, the Garda station in Kilfinane, my home town, will close its doors for the last time.  I wish to put on record the community's praise for and thanks to Niall McInerney, our local garda, for his service for the past number of years.  Along with Kilfinane, the stations in Galbally, Castletown, Kilmeady and Tournafulla will close their doors for the last time.<\/p><p>I am disappointed by this decision and the way it was announced.  The Minister for Justice and Equality tried to sweep it under a difficult budget and hoped that it would go unnoticed.  It was a sneaky move.<\/p><p>I do not understand the reasoning behind the decision.  For example, \u20ac75,000 was recently spent on renovating Galbally Garda station.  In my home town, a site had recently been acquired for a new state-of-the-art station.  I do not have an iota of a clue as to what has changed since then.  The Minister of State has spent time with communities.<\/p> <p>Therefore, she has been being involved with them.  She knows that decision will be a confidence blow to rural communities whose members are struggling in the current climate.  If one walks up the main street of any small town, one will note that businesses are under pressure, some have closed down and buildings have been left unoccupied.  This move will make the elderly and those who live in isolated areas feel much more vulnerable.  It is a blow to the morale of the members of the Garda, whose morale is already at a pretty low ebb.  The only winners in all of this are the likes of the two shysters that I followed from Kilfinane to Ballyorgan the other day after getting a tip-off from a neighbour that these men were on their way under the guise of cleaning garden paths for a good price and clearing gutters.  I never saw people come to clear gutters without a ladder and they did not have one.  I got the number that was given and like any good citizen I telephoned my local Garda station and gave the garda on duty the number.  When I travelled back the road and called into my neighbours, a number of whom live alone, to see if they were okay, one old woman in particular who lives a few houses up from me, was terrified when I knocked on her door because she thought these men had come back again.<\/p><p>If I was to telephone my local garda in Kilfinane and say &quot;Niall, these guys are on the beat, can you come and sort it out&quot;, he would have been there in a matter of moments but now he has been moved somewhere else down the road and I have to call a central station and they will send out a patrol car.  The Minister of State may know the area stretching from Bruff to the borders of County Cork in Kildorrery and now by the time it will take a garda to come out to my area, those men will be gone to the hills, never to be seen again.<\/p><p>I am told by some people and by members of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na that it cost approximately \u20ac2,000 a year to run these stations and cover the cost of heating and lighting.  If one takes into account the five stations in County Limerick, it would cost \u20ac10,000 a year to run them.  That is the price of a secondhand car and such provision would give local people confidence and a sense of safety in their homes.  <\/p><p>I do not know what is the contingency plan and what is going to be left.  We will have imposing buildings in small towns that will be vacated and become a haven for rats, for anti-social behaviour.  I do not understand what consultation was carried out.  Was there consultation in the Department with the senior Minister?  I was assured last year when this move was first mooted that a number of these stations would not be closed but now they being closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000038#MM00900","speaker":"1119","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359557400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>The Senator has one minute remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000039#NN00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1359557400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I will conclude shortly.

It is an opportunity also to express our deep gratitude to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  It is only when a tragic event like this occurs that we realise the difficulties they face and the risks they take on our behalf every day.  This was unusual but nevertheless the consequences are enormous for Detective Garda Donohoe's family and our deepest sympathies go to his immediate family and his wife and children who will feel his loss more than anyone else.<\/p><p>  The Minister has asked me to thank the Senator for raising this matter of significant public importance as it provides me with an opportunity to set out in clear and unambiguous terms the rationalisation of the Garda station and districts network.  In 2012, 39 Garda stations were closed, eight of which had not been open for a number of years.  Their closure was a paper exercise which simply recognised reality, a reality concealed by the Minister's immediate predecessor.  Many more were only one or two-member stations.  This year, following a comprehensive assessment by the Garda Commissioner of the Garda station network, a further 100 are listed for closure in the Commissioner's Policing Plan for 2013.  Prior to the closures which took place last year, the Garda station network was essentially the same as the Royal Irish Constabulary network in 1922.  Such a large-scale static deployment of resources is no longer appropriate in the present day where the transport and communications infrastructure have been transformed beyond recognition.  The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has a class-leading police computer system, a state-of-the-art digital radio system, and a transport fleet which is currently receiving significant investment.  The new Garda roster currently being piloted provides a better match between Garda availability and policing demands.  <\/p><p>  All of these developments enable the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to be more mobile and flexible, and to deliver a more effective policing service.  We also must be honest about the level of policing service that was capable of being provided from the stations that were and are to be closed.  Of the 100 stations to be closed in 2013, 98% are open part-time, 94% are open for three hours a day or less, 88% are served by one garda, and only 5% are served by three or more Garda personnel.  The objective is to maximise the time our well-trained and highly skilled garda\u00ed spend on operational duties.  <\/p><p>  After the closures in 2013 - the majority of those to close will close on 31 January 2013 <b>- <\/b>there will still be 564 Garda stations in the State.  That is still significantly more than in comparable jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland, where there are 86 stations with a population of 1.5 million people, or Scotland, where there are approximately 340 stations for a population of 5.2 million.  Are the naysayers seriously suggesting that we should act as if time had stood still since 1922?  <\/p><p>  Commissioner Callinan has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which in turn will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.  The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will continue to be provided to our communities.  <\/p><p>  In addition, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has recently acquired a number of vehicles which are being converted into mobile Garda offices and it is planned that they will be assigned to areas where Garda stations have been closed to ensure that members of the public can continue to conduct their business and interact with members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  Garda\u00ed continue to work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.  Neither the Minister nor this Government will shirk in our responsibility to do everything we can to ensure that the connection with the community is not broken and that the best possible resources are made available to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  The Minister is confident that members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na will continue to provide a professional policing service across the country in a manner that is effective, efficient and consistent with the highest standards for which the force is renowned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000039#NN00800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1359557400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply but I do not believe that she believes what is in that reply.  We all know that times have changed but how can we possibly maximise a garda's time by taking him or her from the station in a local community where he or she was doing a job among people he or she knew and putting him or her in another station a few miles down the road?  How is that a maximum use of his or her time?<\/p><p>Policing has not changed.  It relies on good, solid information and that can only be got from knowing the people one is working with in a community, knowing their families and everything about them.  A garda involved in a local area knows the people in that area inside out.  He or she can stop crime before it ever becomes an issue.  I cannot understand how we can maintain a strong connection with the community by closing down rural Garda stations.  It does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000039#NN00900","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1359557400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Policing has changed and good police work has changed dramatically and significantly, and for the better.<\/p> <p>To say it has not does a disservice to the Garda.  The mechanisms by which the force gathers information have changed and the service cannot continue as it is without taking a serious look at how best to use a talented and well trained police force.  There will be difficulties and it is not as if the force will not change in the future.  Perhaps alterations need to be made and that will be taken into account but this is not being done on a whim by one person.  This is very much a process on which there has been massive consultation and the Commissioner believes this is the best way to proceed.  Communications and mobility have improved and all these factors must be taken into account.  We cannot ignore the significant innovations that have taken place in all our lives.  Innovations have been adapted to suit the needs of our police force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013013000039#NN01000","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1359558000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 8.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 31 January 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
