Senator Comiskey raised an Adjournment matter yesterday concerning a Gaelscoil in his and my area, Gaelscoil Chnoc na R&eacute;, which is seeking that a second class would start for the next school year.  The Government will not allow that, however, although there is no good reason for this in terms of demographics, geography, funding or anything else, nor, indeed, is there an argument that it adversely affects the future of any of the other schools in the area.  Despite Senator Comiskey's best efforts last night, a very unsatisfactory answer was given by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Government.<br \/>The reality is very far from the commitments of the programme for Government or the individual stated positions or manifestos of Fine Gael or Labour in respect of their notional support for nurturing the Irish language and education through the medium of the Irish language.  I ask that we would have an urgent debate on this because there are instances, such as the one Senator Comiskey and I would promote in Sligo and others throughout the country, that require support before it is too late in the context of enrolments for next September.  I ask that this could happen well in advance of the summer recess so we can have an accurate and informative debate and get to the nitty-gritty of what the Government's position is, and whether we are supporting this or whether it is conditional on other issues.<br \/>I again propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, come to the House to discuss the high-level review of maternity services in the West-North West Hospital Group, an issue I raised yesterday.  The proposals in the review put in danger the maternity services of the West-North West Hospital Group, which, as we know, stretches from Galway to Donegal and from Mullingar to the Atlantic ocean.  I see the trusted publication that is <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today has a headline on page 3 outlining this detail and the fact it could be politically explosive, although, of course, we in these Houses know that, and this is just one report.  I have a copy of the report with me and I am happy to make it available to every Member of the House so we can discuss its detail.  The Government denial that the content of the report is under consideration is extremely worrying and it is cynical in the extreme that these plans are being prepared in secret and in advance of polling day, after which, presumably, it will come to public light.<br \/>I have a further revelation for the Leader, which might be a little worrying.  While I have the report which relates to the West-North West Hospital Group, I point out to the Leader that others exist that cast doubt over the future of the following centres: Tralee, south Tipperary, Clonmel, Kilkenny, the Leader's own area of Waterford, Cavan-Monaghan, Wexford, Mullingar, Portlaoise and Drogheda, which are all being considered for downgrading or midwife-only-led services.  What I would say in regard not only to my own region, which is covered by this report, but in regard to the Leader's region and those of many Members of this House, is that there are very genuine concerns among mothers who hope to grow their family, or those who hope to be mothers in the future, as to whether they are going to have obstetrician-led services in their area, and as to whether this Government is planning, as I have revealed for my area, to dismantle obstetrician-led maternity services in the West-North West Hospital Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400003#B00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1400063400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Following on from yesterday's Order of Business, at which I spoke on the Guerin report and sought a debate on it in this House, I wish to report to the House that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality is going to attend before the justice committee on, I think, next Tuesday, 20 May.  Indeed, we are in the process this morning of conducting hearings on oversight mechanisms for policing and the Garda.  I would again ask the Leader for a more overarching debate in the House on policing and the findings of the Guerin report in early course.  Now that we know the Secretary General is likely to attend next week, I believe we could move forward during the following week or the week after that to have a debate in this House on policing.<\/p><p>I thank the Leader again for organising the debate last night on Boko Haram and the appalling abductions of the schoolgirls in Nigeria.  In the course of that debate, some interesting issues were raised.  In particular, I commend Senator van Turnhout on raising an issue about domestic legislation which is open to potential abuse, namely, the provisions in the Family Law Act, as retained by the Civil Registration Act 2004, which allow an exemption from the normal legal minimum age for marriage, which is 18, and allow children to marry at 16 under certain conditions.  That exemption has been commented on unfavourably in the High Court as being open to abuse.  I would like to express my support for Senator van Turnhout's view that we could bring forward Private Members' legislation in this House on the issue.  Indeed, it is something I some months ago raised with the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Social Protection and I believe there would be support at Government level for such legislation.  I will certainly be working with Senator van Turnhout on that and we might seek a debate on it in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400003#B00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1400063400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik.  I would certainly be very open to working with her on bringing forward legislation, which would be quite a discrete piece of legislation.  As she said, we had a debate in the Seanad yesterday about the mass abduction of a reported 234 and possibly as many as 300 schoolgirls in the rural village of Chibok in north-eastern Nigeria by the militant Islamic extremist organisation, Boko Haram.  Senators were given five minutes to make a statement and, as I said in my intervention, it was nearly impossible to bring any substance to such an important issue in such a limited time.  The issues are extremely complex and extend far beyond what immediately appears relevant.  To understand how best to tackle kidnapping, it is necessary to understand the genesis of Boko Haram and its five year reign of terror in north-east Nigeria.  Issues pertaining to economic drivers, corruption, bad governance, state violence and external radical religious ideology sit side by side with prevailing acts of violence against women, gender based violence and breaches of women's reproductive health and rights worldwide.<\/p><p>I call on the Leader to facilitate a full debate on violence against women and gender based violence.  I know this is something the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, would welcome also, and it would be good if we could have a wider debate on this issue.  There are lessons for Ireland to learn and actions that Ireland can take.  I would like to use this opportunity to acknowledge that yesterday marked the launch in Ireland of the global rights campaign &quot;I Decide&quot;.  The campaign was launched by the IFPA and calls on world leaders to support women's and girl's basic sexual and reproductive rights.  &quot;I Decide&quot; focuses on four key rights of all women and girls across the world: the right to decide what happens to their bodies and who to share their life with; the size of their family; whether to have children and, if so, when and how many children; and the right to decide their future.  The &quot;I Decide&quot; campaign is calling for sexual and reproductive health rights to be central to the new development framework which will replace the Millennium Development Goals after 2015, and aims to collect 1 million signatures to present to UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in the summer of 2015.  Mine will certainly be one of those signatures.<\/p><p>I note the Leader has proposed we discuss the motion on the joint committee of inquiry into the banking crisis this evening, which I will certainly support.

This means that someone who wants to drop into the local shop to purchase a newspaper or whatever is only obliged to pay a very small amount.  If he or she leaves her car there for an additional five or ten minutes, he or she is only obliged to pay for an additional 15 minutes.  It makes sense to draw attention to what the authorities in France have done in respect of this matter, particularly as the lifeblood is being sucked out of many of our main streets as a result of the car parking charges that apply.  What has been done in France makes sense and I am of the view that we should consider following suit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400004#C00100","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1400064000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I do not want to get involved in the activities of the Sligo amateur drama society this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400004#C00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1400064000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>What about Tralee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400004#C00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1400064000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Tralee is grand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400004#C00400","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1400064000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Tralee is a bit of a concern now.

RIA has directed that no one connected with the political parties, etc., is allowed to speak to residents at the centres.

That is all I will say on the matter for now.<\/p><p>I wish to bring to the attention of the House an issue that has been raised with me in recent days by the snap net fishermen who operate on the River Suir.  For those who may not know, snap net fishermen work in teams of four on small boats approximately 18 ft long and known as cots.  There are usually two fishermen per cot and they spread a net across the river, generally on the tide, between two cots.  They only fish during certain months.  This year, however, Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, has prevented fishing on the River Suir because it states that the numbers of fish counted in previous years were so low.  According to the snap net fishermen to whom I refer, the IFI has agreed with them that the counts of salmon on the River Suir were actually inaccurate.  I am of the view, therefore, that the fishermen cannot be prevented from operating on the basis of such counts.  This issue has been ongoing for some years but matters have come to a head this year because the fishermen have been completely banned from the river.  The tradition of snap net fishing dates back more than 1,000 years.  It is no longer a commercial enterprise.  Rather, those involved are merely maintaining the tradition to which I refer on the Suir and also on the River Nore and the River Barrow.  I request that the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy O'Dowd, who has responsibility for inland fisheries, to come before the House for a debate on this matter in order that we might obtain some degree of clarity.<\/p> <p>We cannot allow men to be prevented from engaging in fishing based on the provision of inaccurate information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400004#C02000","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400064600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Yesterday I had intended to raise an issue, but I was unable to do so because time ran out.  The issue was one that had received extensive coverage in the national media and related to the sequel to the death in Mullingar of Mr. Andrew Dolan from Carrick-on-Shannon.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.  The case finally came to a conclusion yesterday, but serious issues arise from it which have been reported in the media and which I wish to bring to the attention of the Leader.  Judge Anthony Hunt said Mr. Dolan had been \"minding his own business\" on the night in question but had been \"singled out and confronted by Ms Hughes\" who had slapped him.  He was subsequently struck by Mr. Patrick Daly.  The people involved, whose names are in the public domain, were Ms Jessica Hughes of Killucan, County Westmeath and a Mr. Patrick Daly of Clonard, County Meath.  Mr. Dolan was struck by Mr. Daly before another man delivered a blow which resulted in an injury which proved fatal.  The third person involved, Mr. Patrick Farrell, has already been sentenced to three and a half years in prison.  The point I wanted to make was that the judge had said that in a \"human sense\" the pair had contributed to the death of Mr. Dolan.  He also said he was saying this \"in the most general sense, not in the narrow legal sense.\"  He suggested the law could be looked at to cover the issue of peripheral involvement in order to deal with matters of collective responsibility.  In other words, the three people in question attacked this innocent young man who had been at a party, put his hands up to walk away and said, \"Please don't hit me, please don't hit me.\"  As his parents said, all of his family had been advised to walk away from trouble.  As a result of the fatal blow, his head hit the sidewalk outside the fast food restaurant in Mullingar and he subsequently died.  Not only was his death such an appalling tragedy, its timing could not have been worse in that it happened over the Christmas period.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to take account of the comments of Judge Hunt in this case?

Undoubtedly, this will inflate house prices.  This has happened in a similar scheme in the United Kingdom and is something we do not need.  The British &quot;help-to-buy&quot; scheme for houses worth up to &pound;800,000 only inflated the market, as reported in Mr. Sheahan's article.  One of the key pieces of research, from the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, was entitled, Too Much Capital for Housing.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but if supply is inelastic and the amount of finance available is increased, prices will rise.  This is a problem we must address.  I draw attention to a comment made by Professor Ronan Lyons of TCD during the week.  He said construction wages in Ireland were still 25% higher than in Germany.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons we have a housing market that is in the state it is in.  We have had a recession and consumers now have less money to spend.  House prices should fall even more, which is the way we can solve the problem.  The Government is studying the issue, but we must be aware that the last time builders and bankers got together, they did serious damage to the country.  In Mr. Sheahan's article a statement attributed to a Government spokesperson indicates that the banks are offering 90% mortgages, but that the business is capital intensive for the banks.  It is, but freeing capital into the housing market will push up prices.  The evidence is that a 20% deposit and a maximum loan of approximately two and a half times one's income are required to have stability in the housing market.  The danger is we could start all over again the same cycle that resulted in so much damage being caused the last time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400005#D00900","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1400064600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, is a treatment used in mental health services which involves the passing of an electric current through a person's brain.  In 2012, the last year for which we have figures available, 244 patients received ECT treatment, of whom, incredibly, 27 received it without their consent, of whom four were unwilling to give it.  The Mental Health Act, section 59, is the governing legislation in this regard.  All that is required, if a patient is unwilling or unable to give consent, is the recommendation of two consultant psychiatrists.  Last week my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, indicated her willingness to remove one element of section 59, namely, the words \"unwilling to give consent\".  Perhaps she does not fully understand the position and the argument being made in this regard.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State to come to the House in order that we can impress on her the importance of deleting the entire section which allows ECT treatment to be given with the consent of two consultant psychiatrists without the patient's consent.  There is no other legislation of which I am aware on the Statute Book which allow such a deeply invasive procedure to be performed without people's consent.  If there is a necessity for ECT treatment - I have grave doubts about this having been a psychiatric nurse for 30 years - as a measure of last resort or as a life-saving procedure, the argument should be made in court.  The authority should not be given to two medical personnel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400005#D01200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1400064600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>On 1 May I launched my party's workers' rights proposals to coincide with International Labour Day.  One of the things for which we have called consistently and which is also called for in the document is collective bargaining legislation and trade union recognition.  We cannot have collective bargaining in the State without trade union recognition.  The announcement made yesterday was not surprising.<\/p> <p>The Government announced that it is going to bring forward legislation to enable collective bargaining but it will not include trade union recognition.  That is a big mistake because one cannot have one without the other, effectively.  In the Leader's own county of Waterford, for example, a number of years ago, the TalkTalk company closed.  Not only was there shock at the loss of 500 to 600 jobs, there was also shock at the manner in which the workers found out that their jobs were gone and the disgraceful way they were treated by their employer at the time.  There was no trade union although there was what is known as a company union or an employee representative group.  That is what happens when one does not have trade union recognition and companies which will not negotiate with trade unions.  It is a fundamental right for any citizen who is a member of a trade union to be represented by that body.  As we have seen in so many cases, however, many companies, including Ryanair, the aforementioned TalkTalk and many others will not recognise trade unions.  In such circumstances, workers are being denied a basic right.  <\/p><p>I call for a debate on this issue.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come to the House before he publishes the legislation so that we can take him through our concerns - and that of many in the broad labour movement, including the Labour Party and the trade unions themselves - with what is being proposed.  Obviously the trade unions have been lobbying the Labour Party but it is also quite clear that employer organisations have been knocking on a different door and have been lobbying Fine Gael.  It would seem that the employers got exactly what they wanted because while we will have some form of collective bargaining legislation, it will fall far short of what is required.  It will be yellow-pack collective bargaining introduced in the 101st anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out.  In the context of the celebration of the centenary of the Lock-out last year, it falls far short.  <\/p><p>This is an area that we should be discussing because there are a number of Senators in this House who were elected through the Labour Panel to represent the interests of labour.

The income tax rates act as a disincentive for educated young people.  I had occasion on Monday night last to speak to two young siblings who hope to graduate this year.  They both want to emigrate to gain experience abroad.  However, another reason for emigrating was the rate of tax that they would have to pay in this country.

The report was published after extensive consultations all over Ireland and it highlights the economic crisis facing our fellow citizens in rural Ireland.  It draws particular attention to the lack of integrated planning between Government Departments and State bodies.  Each Department and the State body is working in a silo and is immune to what is happening in other Departments and bodies, with the result that disastrous decisions are being made all over the country.  Today 40% of our fellow citizens live in rural Ireland and they are experiencing the loss and closure of key amenities like Garda stations, banks and public houses as well as being threatened with the closure of post offices and schools.  Last night there was an excellent report by Michael Lehane on the 9 o'clock news on RTE on the village of Ballycolla in Laois, where the post office is threatened with closure at the end of the month.  The villagers spoke of their anguish about the survival of their village.  Their fear was visceral.  Most of the villagers are pensioners and the post office is the mainstay of the village.  The people are completely reliant on the post office for banking, paying bills, collecting their pensions and more.  The lady who owns the local shop in the village explained that people go to the post office to collect their pensions and then they do their shopping in the local shop.  The whole fabric of the village will be affected by this closure.  <\/p><p>In February last there was a protest by the Irish Postmasters Union outside Leinster House.  I spoke at the time with Councillor Mary Bohan, who is the postmistress of Drumkeerin post office, who told me that many of the main banks have closed their smaller branches in rural areas which means that many people, particularly the elderly, now depend on post offices to lodge and withdraw cash.  She also pointed out that many older people do not have transport to bring them to the nearest town to do their banking so they are totally dependent on the local post office.  We must stop the decline of our rural communities.  <\/p><p>Yesterday I spoke about the savage cuts affecting older people and the withdrawal of discretionary medical cards from more than 50,000 people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400006#E00700","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1400065200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400006#E00800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1400065200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>This Government is not leading this country back to economic and social stability.

I do not understand why when a house becomes vacant, it cannot be allocated immediately.  There seems to be a policy in local authorities that they must refurbish the house before it can be re-allocated.  As a result, there is a delay and the procedure can take up to six months.  By the time the local authority comes to do it, the house has been damaged.  It is the responsibility of local authorities to re-allocate houses within seven days of becoming vacant.  I am asking for a debate on this issue and for local authorities to be made accountable.  It is taxpayers' money that is being squandered.  A total of 499 houses are vacant in Cork city alone.  It is costing the taxpayer an enormous amount of money to refurbish them.  It is time we looked at how we are managing houses once they become vacant.

Taxpayers' money is being squandered right across the board in various Departments.  I concur fully with everything Senator Brennan said about tax rates.  They need to be reduced dramatically.  The USC is a huge imposition on people.  It was brought in to address the fiscal situation and is at an unsustainable level.  Certainly, there should be an immediate move to reduce it to at least 3% or 4%.<\/p><p>I fully support the call by Senator MacSharry for a debate on the report on maternity services and I welcome the fact that the Leader confirmed yesterday that there will be a debate on this issue.  I urge caution on the part of Government Members so that they do not rush to defend the indefensible.  This leads to group-think and bad policy decisions.  They are not really serving their parties or Government well by doing that.  They are far better off challenging them on policies that are not in the interests of our citizens.  If this is followed through on, it will undoubtedly have implications for the north east, as Senator MacSharry has highlighted.  As the Leader knows, it will also have significant implications for the south east where there has been concern in the past with regard to the continuation of maternity services in a number of our hospitals there which provide an extremely good service.  There needs to be a debate.  We need to ensure that the Minister shows leadership in that Department and pursues and implements policies that are in the interests of the people of the country rather than those of people working within the HSE, many of whom do not work.

Yesterday, the Government agreed a major set of measures in response to that report on foot of the proposals brought to Government by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  A commission of investigation to investigate the issues identified in the report will be established soon.  The terms of reference have yet to be finalised but will be in line with the proposals of Mr. Guerin.<\/p><p>The Minister also confirmed that she is to ask the Garda Inspectorate to carry out a comprehensive inquiry into serious crime investigation management operational and procedural issues arising from the findings of the report by Mr. Guerin, taking into account the implementation of the recommendations already made by the inspectorate and earlier reports and work currently being undertaken by the inspectorate.  The Government has also agreed to urgently bring forward new legislation to strengthen the operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which was called for in this House yesterday.  This will be advised by the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Government has also agreed to the Minister's proposals for an independent expert review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>This will be undertaken and completed before the summer recess.  Further details of this independent expert review will be announced in early course and the independent Garda authority is to be up and running by the end of the year.  The new Garda Commissioner will be recruited by open competition, with the establishment of the authority.  Therefore, a lot has been done in a very short period by the Government to act on the Guerin report, which is to be welcomed by the public and everybody involved.<\/p><p>Senator Jillian van Turnhout raised the question of violence against women.  She referred to last evening's debate in the House, which was excellent.  I note her points on the Committee of Selection, but that is a matter for it to deal with.<\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn made a number of points.  VAT on defibrillators is a budgetary matter and I am sure it will be dealt with in the budget.  I am also sure the Minister for Health will be making an effort to have them VAT-free.  On the reduction of the rate of VAT from 23% to 9% for artistic works for sale, this issue can be raised with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in order to influence the Minister for Finance before the budget is announced in October.  However, these are budgetary matters which are totally for the Minister for Finance to decide.  I could not comment on them further.<\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn referred to parking charges and the reduction of the charge period to 15 minutes in France.  I understand this system is already in place in some towns and cities in Ireland.  It should probably be extended to all areas.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to tourism in Killarney and the work of volunteers in protecting oak woods, in particular.  I am sure this is a matter to which we will return at a later stage with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh questioned the ban on canvassing in direct provision centres.  I agree totally with him.  I raised the matter five years ago in connection with a direct provision centre in Waterford in which people were not allowed to canvass, despite the request made by those in direct provision accommodation.  The ban is very restrictive.  As stated by Senator Denis Landy, some candidates were allowed access five years ago, but I am not sure whether that is still the case.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  This is a human rights issue and people in direct provision accommodation should be informed and canvassed by those running for election.  What is occurring is a retrograde step and I will certainly raise the issue with Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>I will find out when the wind turbines legislation will pass through the other House and be brought before this one.  We will be discussing the report on green energy at a later stage.<\/p><p>Senator Denis Landy referred to the plight of snap-net fishermen on the River Suir owing to conservation measures.  There is a query about the numbers.  I will certainly raise the matter with Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd.  Perhaps the matter might be raised on the Adjournment, at which time the Senator could receive a full response from the Minister of State.<\/p><p>Senator Paschal Mooney referred to the tragic death of Mr. Andrew Dolan.  It was an absolutely shocking case and I agree with the Senator that the law should be re-examined, as mentioned by the judge.  The calls made by Mr. Dolan's parents should not go unheeded.  They reflected the views of many parents who had found themselves in similar circumstances in recent years.  There have been senseless acts of violence in many towns and cities throughout the country.  In many cases, they were alcohol fuelled.  As was stated, we have to cry, &quot;Halt.&quot;  I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Michael Mullins referred to the capital investment programme announced by Irish Water.  This is welcome news for many communities throughout the country and long overdue.<\/p><p>Senators Sean D. Barrett and Fidelma Healy Eames mentioned loans for first-time buyers.  This matter was raised in the House yesterday.  Senator Fidelma Healy Eames mentioned that the Governor of the Central Bank would be and had been attending committee meetings.  I am sure the questions she has posed can be answered comprehensively by the Governor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400007#F01400","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400066400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>There is no indication as to when he is coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400008#G00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1400066400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am sure the Senator received the answers to the questions she had posed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400008#G00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1400066400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>The scheme was only announced in the past few days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400008#G00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1400066400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The Leader to continue, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400008#G00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1400066400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Senator Sean D.

I agree totally with the Senator on the situation at TalkTalk.  How workers were treated in that case was totally unacceptable.  This has occurred not only in TalkTalk but in many instances throughout the country.  We can arrange a discussion on the heads of Bill in the House, but I am sure they will be dealt with by the relevant committee also.  It is stated in the Government's proposals for reform of the Seanad that we should debate the heads of Bills in the Seanad when requested to do so, in addition to the relevant committee.<\/p><p>Senator Terry Brennan referred to the rate of income tax.  I agree totally with him.  Putting people on the higher rate when their income reaches &euro;32,000 is absolutely ludicrous.  This matter was also raised by Senator Jim Walsh.  There is a need for the Government to reduce the taxes and the USC imposed by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government.

It is analogous to the way in which establishing and proving ownership of a house by way of title deeds removes much of the risk when buying and selling.  The buyer knows the seller owns the boat and knows there is no outstanding mortgage.  Registration is also useful when visiting foreign ports for proof of ownership.  The amendment my colleagues in sailing put forward is that the period of registration should be for each period of ownership rather than every five years.  They say this is analogous to a house purchase and it should only be necessary to re-register on transfer of ownership.  In this day and age, the fear was that if they had to register every five years the question of charging would enter into it, and a future Minister - not Deputy Varadkar - might see it as a handy source of revenue.  The yacht people are trying to protect themselves in that regard, but there are also extra administration costs.  Distinguished sailors who have travelled from Howth to Greenland and the north of Russia suggested these amendments and I put them forward in that spirit if they are of assistance to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400011#K01600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1400067600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>One of the fundamental gaps in the existing ship registration legislation, which I hope to address in the Bill, is that there is no provision for ship registration renewal.  The absence of a requirement to renew ship registration has led to a situation in which ships remain registered on the existing register books even though they have ceased to exist.  They stay on the register forever.  To address this, the Bill introduces the concept of ship registration renewal, along with a facility to refuse registration and a facility to remove ships from the register, all with the goal of improving the quality and accuracy of the new Irish register of ships.<\/p><p>Section 9(9) of the Bill provides that ship registration on the new register will be granted for an initial period of up to five years and may be subject to compliance with standards or conditions of registration as provided for in section 18(10).  After this initial period of registration, and subject to satisfactory completion of the registration renewal process in accordance with section 19 of the Bill, a ship registration may be renewed for further periods of up to ten years in duration.  A decision to have an initial registration period of five years rather than ten years in all cases was taken having regard to the transitional provisions that will apply to Irish ships registered on the existing register books under the 1955 Act, as provided for in section 14 of the Bill.<\/p><p>The effect of the amendment proposed by Senator Barrett is to replace the requirement to renew registration after specific time periods with a provision that would only require registration renewal when a ship is being transferred to new ownership.  Instead of renewal every five years, the ship would only be renewed on transfer to new ownership.  My concern is that the proposed amendment would remove the clear and unambiguous requirement to renew ship registration, involving an interaction with my Department, at specified times after initial registration and therefore would weaken the capacity to ensure the register was accurate and up to date.  We want to require people to re-register every five years so that they have some engagement with the Department and so that the register is up to date.  We do not want to have a situation similar to the one we have with vehicles, in which cars are often not taken off the file and remain on the file long after they have ceased to exist.<\/p><p>Another concern is that vessels can change ownership regularly.  Some vessels may not change ownership for years but, equally, other vessels may change ownership a number of times, possibly even within the same year.  A requirement to renew registration in such circumstances would be onerous for shipowners and my Department.  Although the Senator's intention is the opposite, there is a risk that people would have to register their vessels more frequently than every five years.  <\/p><p>Registration on the Irish register of ships will be subject to compliance with relevant standards or conditions, or both, of registration.  The requirement to renew registration will afford the Department the opportunity to confirm that a ship is meeting the particular registration or safety requirements that may apply to the category of ship involved, or the part of the register on which the ship is registered.  These provisions are all proposed in the interest of ensuring a high-quality register and ship registration regime that not only appears as such but also has in-built safeguards to ensure, in so far as possible, that the information contained on the register is accurate and that relevant safety requirements applying to ships are being complied with.   <\/p><p>In circumstances in which no changes have been made to a ship, it is not envisaged that ship registration renewal process will be onerous.  I support the concept of periodic time-defined ship registration renewal and, for the reasons stated, propose to retain the timeframes for ship registration renewal as outlined in the Bill.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendments proposed by Senator Barrett.  In the interest of aiding an accurate register and equality of treatment of all ship owners registering a ship on the register, I request the Senator to withdraw the proposed amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400011#K01700","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1400068200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive and full reply.

The purpose of non-operative registration is to assist ships that require certification or licensing in order to register as a particular type of ship.  For example, a sea-fishing boat will require a sea-fishing boat licence and a passenger boat will require a passenger boat licence.  A cargo ship will also require certain certificates.  Non-operative registration allows a ship to be on the register subject to compliance with any relevant certification or licensing requirements that apply to the ship.  Non-operative registration may also be necessary after the initial registration of the ship in circumstances, for example, in which a licence or certificate has expired or a ship is sold and transferred to a new owner.

My Department is the national authority when it comes to preparing legislation relating to ship registration requirements in Ireland.  When the decision was taken to extend the scope of mandatory registration to new categories of ships operating in domestic waters in Ireland, I was conscious of the impact that such requirements might have on ships that visit our country.<\/p> <p>For this reason, section 11 provides that a registration confirming nationality of another state will be an acceptable form of registration for compliance purposes with the registration requirements of the Bill.  Furthermore, in recognition of the fact that some visiting ships, in particular, non-commercial ships, may not have such registration confirming nationality, a new category of visitor registration is being introduced under section 24.  The section establishes a requirement for the registration of personal watercraft, recreational craft 24 m and greater in load line length and small fast powered craft owned by people visiting the State and operating domestically when the craft is not registered in another country.  This will accommodate the use of such craft in Irish waters for short periods not exceeding three months, that is, for people on holidays or taking part in sports events, in cases where the craft is not registered in another state and would otherwise be required under section 11 to have full registration on the Irish register of ships in order to operate domestically.<\/p><p>In view of the fact that the requirement to register on the Irish register of ships is being extended to small commercial angling boats, as described in section 11, it is important to extend the possibility of visitor registration to such vessels if they are visiting Ireland and operating domestically.  Essentially, this relates to vessels that are not required to be registered in the home country but which are visiting Ireland where they must be registered.  It allows them to take up a form of visitor registration for a short period.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 seek to amend section 24(1) and (2)(a) to include small angling boats, as described in section 11(1)(c).  In the absence of such amendments, visiting angling boats fall into this category and would be required to have full registration on the Irish register of ships to operate domestically.  The option of visitor registration provides for a less onerous registration procedure for small visiting angling boats which only propose to operate in Irish waters for a period not exceeding three months.  Visitor registration will not confer nationality, but it will facilitate the State's awareness of the vessels operating domestically in Irish waters.  This will also assist in the identification of owners of ships if search and rescue operations are required.<\/p><p>Visitor registration will be a simplified form of registration for a nominal fee in order not to impact negatively on tourism.  We wish to facilitate tourism.  Every effort will be made to maximise the use of the online facility for this category of registration.  It is envisaged that awareness will be promoted through tourism and transport channels, websites, etc.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 15 is a technical amendment to the wording of section 24(2)(c).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400012#L03800","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400068800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Will the Minister clarify one point?

When it comes to all of these things, whether it be people bringing animals into the State, vehicles in the State or anything else, we have to balance our desire to facilitate business and tourism with the need to protect the public and ensure safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400013#M01200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400068800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400068800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Sections 25 to 30, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400068800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>SECTION 31<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400068800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 16:\r\nIn page 33, line 7, to delete &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s stern&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ship&rdquo;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1400068800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>This is a simple amendment.

I am sure Members will be aware of media coverage reports that skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in Ireland.  It is a particular problem for Irish people because of our fair skin.  The number of new cases of melanoma diagnosed in Ireland has been steadily increasing since the national cancer strategy began publishing data in 1994.<\/p><p>According to figures issued recently by the National Cancer Registry, there were more than 10,000 cases of skin cancer in Ireland in 2011.  The most recent projections from the registry show that the incidence of cancer in Ireland is projected to double by 2040.  Based on current trends, the number of women diagnosed with melanoma is projected to increase by a factor of between 93% and 175% in the period up to 2040 and, in the same period, the increase for men could be of the order of between 134% and 327%.  This is a significant threat to the future health and well-being of our people and requires urgent action.  I am sure everyone agrees prevention is better than cure.<\/p><p>There are approximately 150 fatalities per year from melanoma, with approximately 7,000 people living with this disease in Ireland.  These are not mere statistics.  Behind each of these numbers are people fighting painful and debilitating cancers.  Many of them are winning that fight, but far too many are losing.  The impact of these cancers on individuals and their families cannot be underestimated.  Long-term treatment and its cost on individuals, families and the health system are significant.  Data from the HSE indicates that the cost of treating skin cancer ranges from &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000 per patient, depending on the complexity of the disease.  New high-tech oncology drugs, such as ipilimumab, have become available recently.  This treatment is effective in a number of cases, but is extremely expensive.  It costs between &euro;50,000 and &euro;80,000 to treat each patient with this drug.  Between 60 and 80 patients present with such advanced melanomas each year.<\/p><p>Skin cancer is preventable in many cases.  If we take the proper precautions and protect ourselves and our children, we can avoid much of this disease.  It is a threat that must be tackled now to prevent the harm that exposure to UV radiation causes and to reduce future costs to the health system.  For most people, the main source of exposure to ultra-violet radiation is the sun.  UV, ultra-violet, radiation is responsible for up to 90% of skin cancers and most UV damage is caused during childhood and adolescence.  A child's skin is most sensitive to UV radiation.  Up to 80% of a person's total life-time UV exposure is accumulated in childhood.  Therefore, protecting children from the damaging effects of UV radiation is very important.<\/p><p>Many people are exposed to high doses of UV radiation through artificial sources.  Sunbeds and sunlamps used for tanning purposes are the main source of deliberate exposure to artificial UV radiation.  All forms of such radiation contribute to skin cancer.  There has been a growing body of evidence over recent years that the use of sunbeds, especially by children, should be restricted because of the associated increased risk of skin cancer and other health problems.  Other expert recommendations include ensuring that protective eyewear is provided to users; that users are informed of the health risks associated with the use of sunbeds; and that sunbed operators are prohibited from attributing health benefits to sunbed use.<\/p><p>The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer is a recognised leading expert scientific body charged with providing evidence-based science to underpin global cancer control policies.  In 2009, the agency reclassified UV-emitting tanning devices from a group 2A carcinogen - one that is probably carcinogenic to humans - to a group 1 carcinogen - one that is carcinogenic to humans.  In 2009, the chief medical officer conducted a review of the international literature on health effects associated with the use of ultra-violet emitting tanning devices.  He found that the medical evidence justifies a complete prohibition on the use of sunbeds by children up to 18 years of age, based on the significantly increased risks associated with exposure to ultra-violet radiation in early years.  The CMO recommended that the issue of the increased risk posed by UV radiation for certain sub\u00adgroups of the adult population could be dealt with by way of regulation and awareness raising.<\/p><p>Healthy Ireland is the Government framework that sets out our vision to improve the health and well-being of the population.  To realise this vision, Healthy Ireland will draw on existing policies, such as the strategy for cancer control in Ireland, but it will also go further by instituting new arrangements to ensure more effective co-operation to achieve better outcomes for all in reducing the incidence of skin cancers.  Achieving the goals set out in Healthy Ireland requires composite solutions.  The banning of the use of sunbeds for children under 18 years of age and regulating their use for those over 18 is an important initiative.  Targeted interventions such as these will, in the long term, reap rewards and foster healthier living.  Healthy Ireland will help to raise awareness on issues, such as the dangers associated with sunbed use, and will help promote healthy lifestyle choices by building on this legislation and by supporting and monitoring collaboration between areas such as primary care, hospitals, cancer screening and clinical programmes.  Prevention is always better than cure, and a lot less painful.<\/p><p>The primary purpose of this Bill is to protect children by prohibiting the use of sunbeds on sunbed premises by those under 18 years of age and to regulate the use of sunbeds by those over 18 years of age.  Our aim is to contribute to the long-term goal of reducing skin cancer rates.  The Bill makes the following provisions.  It makes it an offence to sell or hire a sunbed to a person aged under the age of 18 or to allow them to use a sunbed on a sunbed premises.<\/p> <p>It promotes greater public awareness about the risks of sunbed use across all ages and prohibits unsupervised use of sunbeds in commercial premises.  It provides for an exemption to allow the use of ultraviolet radiation for the medical treatment of specific skin conditions such as dermatitis and psoriasis in both children and adults.  This exemption is limited to treatment involving phototherapy provided under the supervision or direction of a relevant registered medical specialist such as a dermatologist.  The treatment must be provided by a health care establishment.<\/p><p>The Bill sets out mandatory requirements for protective eyewear.  This is an important provision, as the eyes are particularly vulnerable to damage from ultraviolet radiation exposure.  The Bill also sets out certain hygiene requirements for sunbeds and sunbed premises.<\/p><p>To protect public health, the Bill prohibits certain marketing practices such as allowing a customer who rents a sunbed for four weeks to get one week free, or offering early-bird deals.  These offers are commonplace and incentivise clients to opt for a greater number of sessions than they might have originally intended.<\/p><p>The Bill prohibits the use of health claims other than those that may be prescribed by way of regulations.  It has been common for sunbed operators to claim certain health benefits for sunbed use.  Some claim an increase in the production of vitamin D as a result of sunbed use.  The World Health Organization states &quot;incidental exposure to the sun, combined with normal dietary intake of vitamin D, provides adequate vitamin D for a healthy body throughout the year&quot;.  Overall, the serious health risks associated with sunbed use significantly outweigh any claimed benefits.<\/p><p>This Bill is also aimed at raising awareness and helping sunbed users to make more informed choices.  As I have said many times, this is not a nanny State and we do not intend to forbid or ban adults from using the devices.  We will, however, ensure clients are fully informed of the risks involved in using sunbeds so that they can make an informed choice.  To this end, the Bill requires sunbed operators to display warning signs on sunbed premises and social media sites.  The mandatory warning signs will inform the public of the health risks associated with sunbed use.  The operator of a sunbed business will be required to provide information on the risks of sunbed use to potential sunbed users.  This information will be required to be in written form.  The operator must also ensure the potential client has read and considered the information and has signed the form before using the sunbed.<\/p><p>The Bill requires that those supervising the operation, sale or hire of sunbeds should be trained.  Training will cover issues such as the risks of sunbed use, proper screening for potentially exposure-limiting conditions and emergency procedures in case of overexposure to ultraviolet radiation.  To ensure the Bill affords the protection we intend, we have provided for an effective enforcement regime.  To this end, all sunbed operators, including sellers and hirers, will be required to notify the Health Service Executive or its successor stating they provide sunbeds for use, sale or hire.  The notification fee will also be provided for.  To underpin the effective enforcement of this important public health legislation, comprehensive powers are set out in the Bill.  Environmental health officers who have a proven record in enforcement of food safety and tobacco control legislation will be appointed as authorised officers by the HSE.  They will have appropriate enforcement powers to carry out inspections and investigations to verify compliance with this legislation.<\/p><p>A regime for fixed payment notices - on-the-spot fines - for certain offences will be introduced.  This sanction will allow environmental health officers to deal quickly and effectively with non-compliance with the legislation.  It is important that the penalties for failure to comply with the legislation are both proportionate and sufficient to encourage compliance.  The Bill provides for fines of up to &euro;5,000 and terms of imprisonment of up to 12 months.  The HSE may also publish a sunbed non-compliance list that will, in effect, name and shame offenders.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to reforming the health service to focus more proactively on promoting health and well-being.  This Bill represents an important step in that direction by ensuring our children are protected from the harmful effects of sunbeds and by supporting adults in making better-informed decisions about sunbed use.<\/p><p>Prevention is better than cure.  Approximately 150 Irish citizens pass away each year from melanoma alone, 7,000 people are living with melanoma, and there are many thousands who have other forms of skin cancer.  This represents a heavy burden on those individuals and their families and also on the health service.  If we are to begin to address the spiralling increase in skin cancer rates, we must act now.  The statistics I have provided are on what we do currently.  We can alter the future by taking action now to ensure future statistics are nothing like those of today.  I commend this Bill to the House as a real sign of our collective commitment to ensuring prevention rather than just paying lip service to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400015#P00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400070600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I will stick to the issue under discussion, although there are a few others I could discuss.  We welcome this Bill, which was on the programme for Government.  Obviously, the last Administration came to an abrupt end, so its legislation on this matter was not dealt with.  The Prohibition on Use by Children of Sunbeds and Tanning Devices Bill 2012 proposed much of what we are doing today.  We might have amended that instead of waiting two years to go ahead with the one before us.  That is one moan.<\/p><p>Another moan is the one the Irish Cancer Society would have articulated to the Minister directly.  While the society welcomes the Bill as a step forward in cancer prevention and dealing with cancer generally, it has raised a clear issue concerning skin types.  I refer not only to young people under 18, the argument in respect of whom goes without saying, but also to all people with skin types I and II on the Fitzpatrick scale, who have fairer skin.  Most people in Ireland have these skin types.  I contend that they should be prohibited from using sunbeds because they are more susceptible to skin cancer.<\/p><p>The increase in the incidence in cancer in recent years is such that it is clearly not attributable to the amount of sunshine we get in Ireland or the number of foreign holidays we take.  The rate has increased by approximately 70% over the past ten years.  I am sure the Minister covered some of these statistics himself.  There were 8,145 new cases in 2009, and the number has risen since then.  The global incidence of cancer is predicted to increase from 14.1 million cases per annum in 2012 to 25 million per annum in two decades.  Some 70% of cases will be in African, Central American and South American countries, because they are as not as far up the curve on prevention as countries such as Ireland.  That is not to say, however, that we do not have a very long distance to go to beat the scourge of cancer, which is what we all yearn to do.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister could revisit this issue to ensure those with skin types I and II do not use sunbeds, because they are in greater danger.  I am sure the tanning shops and others in the business will have a vested interest in arguing against my proposal.  That is fine - let them argue against it - but it should be remembered the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s vested interest is not in any way related to profit or lifestyle but to saving lives.  We ought to take this on board.<\/p><p>I am sure there is regular contact between the relevant officials in the Department and the Irish Cancer Society.  I suggest that the Minister do as I propose.  If he were to come forward with an amendment along the lines proposed by the society, he would certainly have the support of this side of the House and, I am sure, the other.<\/p><p>On the subject of dealing with the many different forms of cancer, sporadic news reports state that a cure for cancer is so many years away and getting closer all the time.  More people are surviving with the right treatment.  How is it that we are so close to a cure, considering the incidence is increasing to the point at which it is to reach 25 million per annum over the next two decades, as opposed to 14 million per year at present?  The number of deaths is predicted to increase from 8 million to 15 million in the same period.<\/p><p>We all hear about the number of young people getting cancer.  A young person in their 40s in my community has primary colon cancer with secondaries in the liver and lung.  We have all heard such stories in our communities.  People ask whether there is something in our water or air, or whether living close to a mountain has an influence, not to mention mobile phones and pylons.  Are we investing sufficiently in research in the first instance?  While we acknowledge that there is a link between cancer and lifestyle and that there are certain steps we can take, there is really no explanation in some instances.  We hear about people who lead model lives in terms of diet and aerobic exercise but who are cut down by cancer.<\/p> <p> The Minister went through the issues in the Bill, all of which we welcome.  I would ask him to examine just that one issue concerning skin types.  <\/p><p>The national cancer control programme is much celebrated as a successful clinical programme by the Minister and the HSE following the previous Government's work on cancer.  I am from the north west where there is an issue in that regard.  We are all for centres of expertise and excellence, and are not looking for the Mayo Clinic on every street corner or anything like that.  People like the Minister, speech writers and officials take solace in the old cross-Border line, that &quot;We are co-operating with our colleagues across the Border on this, that or the other.&quot;  However, the absence of radiotherapy in the broader north-west region is an issue.<\/p><p>In the old regime, people could be treated in the Beacon Clinic for a form of cancer and the scans were shared with their colleagues in Pittsburgh.  They determined together what the diagnosis and treatment might be.  The national cancer control programme was established by Professor Tom Keane, who did the same work in northern Canada.  They had centres of expertise there but further north in St. George - with a similar catchment to Sligo of about 260,000 - they put in a satellite radiotherapy centre.  That would surely present challenges here.  It cost about &euro;10 million to put in place and &euro;2 million annually to run it, not to mention the challenge of getting health professionals to run it.  Nevertheless, at some stage, some Government will acknowledge this and set it as an aspiration that we ought to put in place.  It could be the Minister's decision and it would be a good thing to do.  It might go some way towards healing the divide, the pain and all of the lies from the pre-election promises on cancer.<\/p><p>It has been done in northern Canada.  Professor Tom Keane said there was a gaping hole up there with no radiotherapy.  They kept the centres of expertise for those requiring surgery who could then return home to convalesce.  If they subsequently needed eight minutes of radium per day that could be delivered locally.  The national cancer control programme has the motto &quot;Centrally developed but locally delivered&quot;.  The Minister might consider those points.<\/p><p>As the Minister has done, we commend the Bill to the House.  Perhaps he might consider that one amendment on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400016#Q00200","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400071200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing forward this legislation.  It is extremely important that proper regulation be put in place to deal with sunbeds.  The Minister said there were approximately 10,000 cases of skin cancer in 2011, which is a huge number.<br \/>In discussing the health service, people tend to focus on the issues that affect them directly, not realising that many people are affected in one way or another by other health issues.  The number of skin cancer cases shows the scale of the problem and underlines the importance of having proper regulations for sunbeds.  <br \/>The Bill before us will help to ensure that proper controls and regulations are put in place.  The Minister referred to the 2009 report by the World Health Organisation's international agency for research on cancer.  Due to that research, the WHO reclassified such skin cancers from 2A carcinogenic to group 1.  As a result of that reclassification there was a greater focus on introducing proper regulations in that regard.  <br \/>Section 4 is quite comprehensive and prohibits sunbeds from being offered to people under 18 years of age.  As a result, people will have to produce an age card or passport to prove they are over 18 in order to avail of sunbed facilities.  The Minister has dealt with that issue comprehensively in section 4.  <br \/>Section 5 deals with the sale or hire of sunbed equipment to a person under 18.<br \/>Section 6 deals with another issue concerning the use of sunbeds which are unsupervised.<br \/>I am also concerned about the purchase of sunbeds online, although I am not sure whether this can be dealt with in the legislation before us.  I have gone through the Bill to check that but perhaps we can re-examine the issue.  Can the legislation deal with someone in Ireland who purchases a sunbed online from a seller outside the jurisdiction?  A lot of online shopping goes on, so someone could purchase a sunbed online and have it delivered here from abroad.  Therefore, is there anything further we can do in this Bill to deal with that matter?  We should certainly examine that possibility.<br \/>The Bill also obliges sunbed owners to register with the HSE.  When the Bill is enacted, the regulations will be put in place and sunbed owners will have six months in which to register with the HSE.  It is fine to have such legislation in place but we must know exactly who is offering this service and what type of service it is.  In addition, those offering the service must be familiar with the regulations.  <br \/>When this subject was initially discussed 12 or 18 months ago, a number of people contacted me who were worried that their business would be affected by the proposed regulations.  This is about the bigger issue of healthcare, however, and it is therefore extremely important that we do not have anyone operating a facility that is contributing to health problems.  This legislation will provide the required comprehensive regulatory framework.<br \/>Given that the country's population is growing, we will also face increasing challenges concerning the medical care to be provided.  We must ensure we are up to date with all other countries, and especially EU states, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the treatments that are available.  We must do everything possible to reduce the incidence of skin cancer, which is what this legislation seeks to achieve.<br \/>The legislation is welcome and has been carefully examined by the Department of Health.  I note that the Minister provided the European Commission with the required three months' notice in respect of the Bill.<br \/>While this may fall outside the ambit of the Bill, I would ask the Minister to examine scanning services that are being offered to the public.  There is a growing problem with such scanning services.  I know of cases where no adequate insurance is provided and, in addition, there are serious question marks over whether people offering such services have received adequate training.  Perhaps the Minister could take note of that point and examine the matter in the not too distant future.  <br \/>I thank the Minister again for introducing this legislation.  I hope we will soon have all the procedures in place so that everyone offering sunbed facilities will be properly registered and compliant with the regulations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400017#R00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1400071200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Minister to the House.  This Bill is an important step towards protecting the public, and particularly children, from the extremely harmful effects of sunbed use.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the comprehensive briefing note I received from the Irish Cancer Society, which I will be drawing on in my remarks.  I have also undertaken my own research on this matter.<\/p><p>As the Minister has outlined, sunbeds have been linked to a variety of adverse health conditions, including eye damage, photodermatosis, photosensitivity and premature skin ageing.<\/p> <p>Most worryingly, there is clear evidence of a link between sunbed use and skin cancer.  Research published in 2009 by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, found a 75% increase in the risk of cutaneous melanoma when people began tanning regularly before the age of 30 years.   <br \/>Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland.  In 2010, 9,450 people were diagnosed here.  Of these, 896 were diagnosed with melanoma, which is the most serious form of skin cancer.  We know that there were 158 deaths from skin cancer in 2011.  The incidence of melanoma in Ireland is increasing, having risen by a phenomenal 137% between 1994 and 2010.  In nine out of ten cases, skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet rays from the sun or from sunbeds and, as such, it can be prevented.  Reducing exposure to UV rays from the sun and sunbeds will significantly reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.  According to research conducted by the Irish Cancer Society in June 2010, 140,000 people in Ireland use sunbeds on a regular basis; 88% of those who use sunbeds are women and 20% are between the ages of 15 and 24 years.  It is vitally important that as legislators we do everything in our power to protect people from preventable skin cancer by legislating for and regulating the use of sunbeds.  As such, I welcome many elements of this Bill, such as prohibiting operators of sunbed premises from allowing anyone under 18<br \/>years of age to use a sunbed on their premises, prohibiting the use of sunbeds in unsupervised premises, requiring sunbed operators to make users fully aware through the dissemination of prescribed information of the risks involved and requiring warning signs to be in place in the premises of all sunbed operators.<br \/>To be honest, I would have liked to see a Bill before us that completely bans the use of sunbeds.  I say that after doing my research, but I understand that the Minister must try to find a balanced way of dealing with the matter.  I can try to push for more, and that is my role.  Sunbeds have been banned in a number of states in Australia - New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia - with the ban being phased in over the coming years.  Sunbeds were also banned in 2009 in Brazil, where, to the best of my knowledge, there have been no successful claims that the ban is an undue interference with people's individual freedom.  <br \/>An Australian study previously published in the <i>Journal of Cancer<\/i>showed that the risk of developing melanoma under the age of 30 increases by a factor of six for people who use sunbeds more than ten times.  What really got to me was the finding that a single visit to a solarium could increase the risk of melanoma by 41%.  A study of people diagnosed with early-onset melanoma shockingly recorded sunbed use in people as young as 14 years of age.  I suppose the accepted logic in Australia, which has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world, is that because 80% of all newly diagnosed cancers are skin cancers, and sunbeds are clearly linked to increased incidence of skin cancer, <i>ipso facto<\/i>, sunbeds will be banned in the interests of the common good.  Unfortunately, the Bill before us does not do this, but I hope we soon arrive at a similar conclusion as people become more educated and informed, because preparing for this debate has been educational and informative for me.  I will flag at this juncture that I will be coming back on Committee Stage with two amendments drawn up by the Irish Cancer Society and tabled in the D&aacute;il by Deputies Billy Kelleher and Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  The amendments seek to introduce an additional layer of protection for those over the age of 18 who are physiologically at greater risk of developing skin cancer from sunbed use.  It is important to note skin types I and II on the Fitzpatrick scale are the most common skin types in Ireland.  According to a medical study in 2010, in comparison with people with skin type IV - the fourth out of six skin types on the scale - people with skin type I are 2.27 times more likely to be at risk of malignant melanoma, while people with skin type II are at double the risk.  In Australia, a number of states, including Victoria, while gearing towards an all-out ban, prohibit people with very fair skin - type I - from using a sunbed and require a skin assessment prior to use.  The amendments I will table seek to prohibit those with skin types I and II from using sunbeds and will extend the capacity of the Bill to save more lives.<br \/>The enjoyment of personal freedoms and the right to engage in risky behaviour can be subject to limitation.  For example, I will argue that the common good is proportionately served by dramatically reducing the number of people dying from or being treated for skin cancer in Ireland.  In respect of the dissemination of prescribed information to people looking to use sunbeds, I note in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill that this measure aims &quot;to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer&quot;.  I wonder whether it is too late for a person to receive the information when they are already in the solarium because they have already made the decision to use a sunbed.  Surely we need to disseminate this information as part of a broad public health campaign, particularly in schools, with a view to de-normalising the use of sunbeds in the same way as the Minister is succeeding in de-normalising smoking.  We need to look at other outlets such as magazines and bring together that information on sunbed use.  Preparing for this debate has been hugely informative for me, so we should share this knowledge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400017#R00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400071800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  What seems to be the strangest thing about this legislation is that it is not already on the Statute Book. The Minister's figures about the incidence and increasing rates of skin cancer make it self-evident that this legislation is necessary and overdue.  The link between the use of sunbeds and skin cancer is well established and I do not think anybody would argue against it with conviction.  Knowing this risk, I find amazing that people would willingly put themselves in harm's way.  If I am amazed that adults would do it, I am incredulous that people would pay to put their children in harm's way.  Unfortunately, we might see that in the coming weeks, with confirmations and first holy communions coming up, and we will probably find children as young as seven years of age walking around with grand tans from sunbeds.  It is mind-boggling.  I do not intend to say too much about the generality or necessity of this legislation, because the Minister has made the case strongly enough.  It is, of course, important to re-emphasise that sunbeds are a group one carcinogen.  That alone should be enough to deter any responsible person from exposing children or those under 18 to sunbeds.<\/p><p>I want to ask the Minister one or two questions about the legislation.  Section 3 points to the difference between the cosmetic use of sunbeds and the use of sunbeds for necessary phototherapy.  Do conditions exist that can be treated at a cosmetic studio that has a medical intent?  We will hear people making that case in defence of sunbeds, but surely if it is a medical treatment it would be delivered in a medical suite as opposed to a high street beauty salon.  <\/p><p>Section 6 states that a person who supervises the use of sunbeds must be over the age of 18.  Is there is a risk of exposure for someone supervising, as opposed to using, a sunbed?  I am a bit concerned that we are closing off career paths and opportunities for younger people who might choose to work in the beauty trade.  I will accept the Minister's guidance on this, but are we really saying that the risk of exposure for someone supervising a sunbed is greater than the risk involved in actually using it?  <\/p><p>In respect of section 8, is it necessary to legislate that a sunbed clinic should be clean and hygienic?  Surely that should be the most basic requirement of any premises or business offering a public service.  I wonder why we are singling out sunbeds in respect of legislating for hygiene.  I have a suspicion as to the reason why, which I will come to in a minute.  <\/p><p>Section 13 deals with the requirement of the HSE to maintain a sunbed business notification list and outlines the powers of the HSE and Minister in this regard.  Senator van Turnhout's concerns might be addressed in this area, and I suspect that this might be part of its intent.  The legislation might place such an onerous burden on the providers of sunbed services that it is economically unviable to provide them in the first place.  If that was the intent, the Minister could not really say it.  If that is the case, why do we not seek to have a fully licensed service, as opposed to just maintaining a register, or go even further and ban the provision of sunbed services outright, which Senator van Turnhout is in favour of, as indeed am I?<\/p> <p>That said, I do not believe either of us would find much use for sunbeds.<\/p><p>The Minister spoke about the qualifications and training of the people providing services.  What does he think these might be, given that it seems a rather simple service to provide in terms of qualifications and training?  Under section 15, there is a requirement that the clinic ensure that the instructions on the use of sunbeds are read and understood, and that this form is maintained for two years.  Is this a mechanism whereby the provision of the service is made so burdensome that people might not be bothered doing it?<\/p><p>Section 17 refers to the authorised officer and how such an authorised officer may enter a private dwelling.  It is noted in the Bill that a warrant from a District Court would be required in order to enter a private dwelling.  Is it an oversight on the Minister's behalf that he excludes a peace commissioner from providing the warrant?  In most other legislation the provision of a warrant can be by either a District Court judge or a peace commissioner, who can step in to sign the warrant if a District Court judge is not available.  As a peace commissioner myself, I do this all the time for garda&iacute; when a District Court judge is not available, particularly on weekends, when the use of sunbed services would be at its greatest.<\/p><p>We recently passed in the House some stages of the legislation that prohibits smoking in cars, under which the onus of responsibility and the penalty would apply to the person who is actually doing the smoking in the car.  Is there any scope to have an additional level of liability for parents who expose their children to the use of sunbeds, in addition to penalising the premises itself?  Does the Minister believe class 1 and class 2 fines are sufficient in this area, given that they are limited to &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 respectively?<\/p><p>As far as I can see, there is no provision in the legislation for action to be taken against a consistent breaker of the rules in order to close the premises entirely.  The Minister might give me his opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400018#S00200","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400072400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in party, I welcome the publication of this Bill and commend it to the House and to all Senators.  It is, in our view, a vital protection of public health.  I will refrain from taking the opportunity to discuss cancer services in the south-east, including Waterford, because I believe the Minister is going to be in Waterford city on Friday.  I am glad to see he is back to full health and I look forward to seeing him both inside and outside Waterford Regional Hospital on Friday when he visits.<\/p><p>This is an important Bill.  It is very simple: sunbeds cause cancer.  It should not go any further than that when people make up their minds on whether they support this Bill.  If the Bill is passed and implemented, then lives will be saved, fewer people will get cancer and less taxpayers' money will be spent treating people with cancer.  Therefore, there will obviously be huge benefits to having the Bill passed.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout has already articulated areas in which some in the Opposition, including my own party, would like the Minister to go further and would support him in his efforts if that were the path he chose.  While he may not take the opportunity here, I have no doubt that if this Bill is implemented in its current form we will be back here at some point in order to take it further, because it just makes sense and is logical to do so.  Anything that makes sense and is logical is something we should do.<\/p><p>I understand that it is difficult to strike a balance between what might be seen as coercion and the use of legislation to encourage a modification or a change in social behaviour.  With the smoking ban, we have seen that we can meet with resistance and that we sometimes try to strike a balance where we should not.  In my view, we should come down on the side of the simple principle that should underpin our approach to this issue - it saves lives.  It is as simple as that, and this is what should guide us.<\/p><p>The ban on smoking in public premises and in the workplace has been a clear success in public health terms, but it would not have been possible without the years of widespread education of the public about the reality of lung cancer and the many other illnesses caused by smoking.  A long battle was fought against the massive resources of the tobacco industry.  That battle is not yet over and the Minister is still implementing positive measures in this area, which my party supports.  While we do not have the same lobby on the issue of sunbeds, because the numbers are smaller, I am sure the Minister has been lobbied, as we all have been.<\/p><p>Smoking has both a social and a physical aspect.  For some, there is a perceived social or peer pressure to smoke, although that has greatly diminished.  Far more important is the physical addiction to tobacco that is so difficult for people to overcome.  In contrast, the attraction of tanning with sunbeds is purely a product of social and cultural attitudes.  It is about the body image favoured by many in our society, which is where we now need to focus our attention.  Education on this issue is hugely important and should go hand in glove with the passing of this legislation.  There is almost a compulsion for sections of our population to have a permanent tan because of the widespread perception that a tan is necessary in order to appear attractive and even healthy.  I am sure if any of us were to take a walk down to a hotel in the city where a wedding was taking place, we would find many people with fake tans, including people under the age of 18, and this is not just the case at weddings but also at confirmations and communions.  I would certainly not allow my child to use a sunbed, although if they reached the age of 18, they could make up their own mind.  Hopefully, we will have moved to an outright ban before my children reach the age of 18.  It is incredible to think that some people would allow their young children to lie on sunbeds, given the inherent and real dangers this poses to their health.  It is obvious that education has to be part of this and that we have to educate the adults as well the children.<\/p><p>A very interesting survey was carried out last year among 243 transition year students at five County Sligo post-primary schools on their attitudes to skin cancer, sunbed use and tanning.  The results were quite alarming.  Of most concern is the belief among 73% of those surveyed that a sunbed tan provides a so-called safe base for a holiday tan, and the persistence of the myth among some that it is a cure for acne.  The clinical nurse specialist in dermatology who carried out the Sligo survey said that while the long-awaited ban on sunbeds for those under the age of 18, provided for in this Bill, is to be welcomed, a nationwide sun awareness campaign is essential.  I would certainly echo that call.<\/p><p>Legislation, to be effective, must go hand in hand with public education and awareness.  In this regard, I commend the work of the Irish Cancer Society, which has done a great deal to expose the reality of what sunbeds mean for public health in Ireland.  The statistics are grim.  Up to nine out of ten cases of skin cancer are caused by ultraviolet radiation from the sun or from sunbeds.  In 2009, the International Agency for Research on Cancer placed sunbeds in the highest category of cancer risk - as carcinogenic as tobacco and plutonium.  The most common cancer in this country is skin cancer.  More than 9,000 people were diagnosed with skin cancer in this State in 2010, nearly 900 of them with melanoma.  There were more than 150 deaths from skin cancer in 2011.  Obviously, all of these figures should be of great concern to us.  Indeed, the incidence of melanoma is rising every year and the current rate is over 130% higher than that recorded in 1994.  The risk of developing cancer as a result of sunbed use is greater among young people, yet the Irish Cancer Society researchers found that, in 2010, some 28,000 young people under the age of 25 used sunbeds in this State, many on a weekly basis.<\/p><p>To come back to the social attitudes which lead to sunbed use, 88% of those who use them are women, as Senator van Turnhout said earlier, and 20% are between the ages of 15 and 24.  It is very clear that parents as well as children need to be educated about the dangers.  No responsible parents who are properly informed of the high risk of cancer to which they are exposing their children would allow them to use sunbeds.  It is appropriate, therefore, that a special focus of this Bill is the protection of children.  I welcome the outright ban on the use of sunbeds by people under the age of 18.  Welcome also is the new regulatory regime for a sector that has been unregulated up to now.  I look forward to seeing these regulations put in place and implemented comprehensively, and I urge the Minister to ensure the necessary resources are in place to do so.<\/p> <p>I am not certain of the wording of section 14(1) which enables the Minister to prescribe training leading to a qualification in the safe use of sunbeds - I believe that is the terminology used - which is recognised within the National Framework of Qualifications, or an equivalent qualification.  Apart from the exempted area of phototherapy, surely the whole thrust of the Bill is that there is no safe use of sunbeds.<\/p><p>I had intended to say more, and I did not get to the discuss the amendments proposed by my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  We hope the Minister will accept them in good faith because they were proposed in order to enhance the Bill.  We should move a step further and ensure that we do our best to save as many lives as possible, reduce the incidence of cancer and push down the figures and, crucially, save the taxpayer money as well as save lives.  The Bill is to be welcomed and I commend the Minister on its introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400019#T00200","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400073000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, and the legislation is welcome as well.  About 40 years ago my wife and I bought a sunbed in order to use it at home.  Within weeks my wife discovered that using sunbeds was not a healthy thing to do and the sunbed disappeared somewhere else.  That is a reminder of how quickly attitudes change.  Sunbeds are a bit like smoking, because we have known for years that smoking is dangerous.  I shiver whenever I see somebody smoking on the street, and the same applies to sunbeds.<br \/>We should look closely at legislation that could have a negative effect on legitimate businesses, but at the same time we must remember that health concerns take precedence.  It has been interesting to get some idea of how harmful sunbeds are.  I have not been here all day but I am sure the dangers have all been covered.  In 2009, the World Health Organization categorised tanning devices as a high-level carcinogen, which puts tanning on a par with tobacco use.  The same legislation called on all Governments to regulate sunbed use, which is what the Minister for Health is doing now.  The WHO says that the use of sunbeds before the age of 35 increases the risk of melanoma by 75%.  Some countries have banned sunbeds altogether.  As all health implications become clearer with the passage of time, will Ireland eventually go down the same route?  My colleague Senator Crown wants to make Ireland the first smoke-free country in the world and I hope we will take steps in that direction.<br \/>I note that section 6 of the Bill prohibits the unsupervised use of sunbeds.  Should we include something exclusively in the Bill to effect a ban on self-service automated or coin-operated sunbeds?  We have such machines here and they pose a danger because there may be no staff around to help the person using the sunbed if something goes wrong.  The inclusion of the section means that supervision is required, but automated sunbeds are still permitted.  In Wales, which is part of the UK, coin-operated sunbeds are banned, but we do not have the same reference in the Bill.  Should a reference be included to clear up any confusion?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on the issue.<br \/>I note that the legislation does not apply to medical treatment.  The Bill states:<blockquote>This Act does not apply to the use of a source of artificial ultra-violet radiation used for phototherapy is provided under the supervision or direction of a relevant medical practitioner in a healthcare establishment, or provided elsewhere by that establishment under such supervision or direction.<\/blockquote>The UK legislation, applicable to England and Wales, states that a sunbed can be used by a person under 18 for the following reasons:<blockquote>(a) the use is for the purpose of medical treatment provided under the supervision or direction of a registered medical practitioner, and <br \/>(b) the sunbed is a dedicated sunbed in, or provided by, a healthcare establishment.<br \/>... &ldquo;dedicated sunbed&rdquo; means a sunbed that is made available only for use for the purpose of medical treatment[.]<\/blockquote>Where the conditions for the exemption are met, a person under 18 years may be allowed to use or be offered the use of a sunbed, or to be present in a restricted zone containing a sunbed, without an offence being committed.  Should we open Irish legislation in order to give doctors a little bit more flexibility to use sunbeds?  Should we allow them to make a judgment on whether a person under 18 years can use them?  I for one would trust a doctor's judgment on this matter and it seems the UK has adopted the same view.  We should seriously consider allowing the power to remain in the hands of medical professionals in this regard.  Some doctors support the use of sunbeds for specific ailments.  Professor Tim Oliver, a consultant oncologist at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, has expressed this view, and I know other experts in dermatology and related fields support this.  We should take their expertise into account when considering the Bill.<br \/>I am interested in hearing the Minister's comments on my specific questions on automated sunbeds and letting doctors have more flexibility in the use of sunbeds.  In overall terms, the Bill is something we must approve of, and the sooner it becomes law the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400020#U00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1400073000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their support for the Bill and for the many contributions they made.  I will address the issues in the order in which they were raised.<\/p><p>By way of general comment I wish to reiterate that skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in Ireland.  It represents a major public health challenge in both the short and long term.  We cannot ignore the frightening figures and projections provided by the National Cancer Registry.  I can repeat the figures for anyone who thinks this proposed legislation is frivolous or indicative of a nanny state approach, although I acknowledge that nobody in the Chamber thinks so.  More than 850 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed in Ireland each year, and more than 150 Irish people die each year from melanoma.  More than 7,000 people were living with this type of cancer in Ireland as per the last statistics in 2011.<\/p><p>As others have pointed out, the sad reality is that we know the disease is totally avoidable.  As I have already said, this is a true case of prevention being better than a cure that is often very painful.  We must legislate now to put measures in place to protect our children and allow adults to make better-informed choices.  We must do all we can to discourage the use of sunbeds and encourage a healthier attitude to protecting ourselves and our children from ultraviolet radiation.  I am convinced that the Bill will contribute to a reduction in the incidence of skin cancers in the long term.  It is a comprehensive response to a serious public health issue.  The Government's key objective in the Bill is to protect young people.  Therefore, we propose to make it an offence to sell or hire a sunbed to a person under the age of 18 or allow such a person to use a sunbed on a sunbed premises.<\/p><p>Through the Bill, and the wider Healthy Ireland agenda, we will create awareness of the dangers of using sunbeds.  We will promote healthy lifestyle choices among the public by building on this legislation and by supporting and monitoring collaboration in areas such as primary care, hospitals, cancer screening and clinical programmes.<\/p><p>I have no intention of passing the Bill only for it to be left on the shelf.  Environmental health officers have a proven track record in the enforcement of a broad range of environmental health legislation.  They play a lead role in the enforcement of food safety and tobacco control legislation.  The impact of their efforts can be seen in the consistently high compliance rates - above 90% - with non-smoking legislation.<\/p><p>I shall now address some of the questions raised.  Senator MacSharry mentioned at the outset, as did several others, that he supported the Irish Cancer Society's amendment providing for a total ban on the use of sunbeds by  people with skin types I and II.  I wish to put on the record of the House that I am the number one supporter of the Irish Cancer Society and the great work it does in raising awareness and funds to help with treatment and research, as well as the colorectal cancer screening project that was rolled out at the beginning of this week.  None the less, this legislation is very much a political decision.  As a Minister for Health who was a practising doctor in the past, I do not believe I can impose my will on other people.  I believe that one should give people the information and let them make an informed decision.  We are not a nanny state.  We allow people freedom of expression and the right to make their own decisions.  On the one hand people think we are too liberal, and on the other they think we are not liberal enough.  We have a duty of care to children, which we take very seriously; hence the banning of the use of sunbeds by children under 18 years.  I do not propose, on a policy principle basis, to accept the proposed amendment.  In any case, there is a real difficulty regarding the enforcement of such a measure because doctors differ over the skin type categorisation of individuals.  I can see real issues with such a measure.<\/p> <p> Senator MacSharry raised the issue of why rates are increasing.  There are a number of reasons, one of which is that people are living longer and, the longer one lives, the more likely one is to develop cancer.  That is based on scientific fact.  The longer one lives, the more the cells mutate and, with more mutations, the greater the chance of a mutation and ending up with cancer.  Second, there is a long lead-in time from taking preventive action to seeing the results.<\/p><p>We are joined by a host of young ladies from some school in the Visitors Gallery.  There are very welcome.  We are discussing a Bill that has a direct impact on them.  We are banning the use of sunbeds for people under 18 years of age because people who use sunbeds increase their risk of getting skin cancer.  Some 150 people die in this country every year from skin cancer.  Every Senator who has spoken is in favour of the Bill.<\/p><p>Prevention works and I have been very critical of my fellow politicians because for too long we have paid lip service to prevention but we do not pay for it.  We must pay for it although it is not politically attractive because we will not see the results before the next general election.  It will not win us any votes but in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, it will have saved thousands of lives and billions of euro in health care costs.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke spoke about scanning services.  HIQA licensing legislation is being worked on in the Department to afford it the right to license premises.  That includes the likes of services to which the Senator alludes and this ensures certain standards will be met.  At the moment, no standard is applied and we are unsure about the training of individuals purporting to offer these services.  I would be very wary of them.<\/p><p>The Senator also mentioned remote sales.  Awareness raising was also mentioned.  We must raise awareness of melanoma and skin cancer generally.  We launched a melanoma awareness month on 1 May this year, as we did last year and the year before.  It is organised with the support of a number of organisations and on that occasion I called on individuals to regularly protect themselves and their children.  During melanoma awareness month, the Marie Keating Foundation held a skin cancer awareness seminar to launch the annual skin cancer awareness campaign.  This was attended by my officials.  Throughout the summer months, the foundation's nurses will be delivering a free skin cancer education roadshow to communities all over Ireland through the mobile information units.  My Department recently met with the HSE, the Irish Cancer Society, the national cancer control programme and the Environmental Health Association of Ireland to agree a cohesive approach to awareness raising.  The Department and I will continue to ensure there is a focus on awareness, particularly in respect of young people, of the dangers of sunbed and sun exposure.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout talked about banning sunbeds altogether and I have addressed that point.  Senator John Gilroy wondered about the Bill allowing medical treatment but the Bill allows for medical treatment at a medical establishment.  If there were travel issues for people with chronic conditions, arrangements can be made with a local facility.  I am not aware of the risk to the supervisor.  The Senator also referred to legislating for hygiene and asked why it was necessary.  We can never have enough legislation in that regard, irrespective of where it appears in the legislative process.  It is no harm to reassert that point.  Currently, we do not have licensing but we are working towards licensing.  The register is the first part of that.<\/p><p>Qualification and training is very important and the WHO is very clear that unqualified people create a greater danger to people using sunbeds.  That is the result of research.  The Senator raised the position of peace commissioners and the role in signing warrants in the absence of a judge.  That is something we can look into and we can come back to it on Committee Stage.  With regard to the recalcitrant offender, being in jail for 12 months means people will be unable to operate the salon, although this has not stopped some of our drug dealers.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane talked about a total ban, as with tobacco, but tobacco is very different.  Environmental tobacco smoke is involved and sidestream smoke affects people in the room whereas this is a different issue as it affects only the individual concerned.  People have the right to make the decision once they are over 18 years of age.  If they are old enough to decide to go and fight for this country and die for this country they have the right to make other decisions.  I have already covered the point raised about a nationwide sun awareness campaign.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn talked about automated sunbeds and flexibility for doctors.  We considered the use of the authorisation by doctors of the use of sunbeds for those under 18 years of age but, due to the risks, we decided that medical phototherapy should only be carried out under the supervision of a specialist in a health care setting.  We could look at making provision for extraordinary circumstances but people need to be under the care of a specialist.  We need that distance because family doctors can come under all sorts of pressure, stress and strain with no disrespect to them.  They do fantastic work and are part of our health service working day in and day out and very few people have complaints about them.<\/p><p>The training and online aspects are covered.  Section 12 provides that, once the machine is brought into the country from the point of sale, it is considered to come under the Bill.  It does not matter whether it was purchased online.  I thank Members for their contribution and I believe we have done some good work on prevention in the Seanad and in the other House.  Prevention is always better than cure and it will not give us that warm political glow that we might like to feel but, more importantly, we will be able to look back in 20, 30 or 40 years if we are lucky enough to be alive and we will not have our granddaughter or grandson asking why we did not do something about this when we could have, in which case their friend would not be dying.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400020#U00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400073600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1400073600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400021#V00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1400073600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>On Tuesday, 27 May 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400021#V00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1400073600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is appropriate to say, in the presence of a Louth Minister of State, that when one crossed the Louth border on counting day, 6 October 2013, there was a large area all through Meath and Kildare and down through the Dublin constituencies that ended quite close to Killarney, to which was added Galway and Donegal to give the constituencies of the 634,000 people who voted confidence in this House.  That was remarkable, given the range of political opinion in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere that was against the continuation of this House.  In that context, having such an endorsement of the Seanad by the public, against all the odds and against the opinion polls, how do we develop the House in the way in which public opinion so strongly supported?<\/p><p>In presenting the Bill, which is the fifth one I have introduced, I thank the Bills office, the Leader's office, the Seanad office, Professor Eoin O'Dell in Trinity College, who gave important legal advice, and my assistants Dr. Charles Larkin and Ms Ursula N&iacute; Choill.  One of the statements I used most in the debate about the future of this House was to dispute the one by Lord Edward Fitzgerald and quoted by John F. Kennedy in the famous speech which is commemorated at the bottom of the stairs: &quot;Leinster House does not inspire the brightest ideas&quot;.  That is why Lord Edward Fitzgerald went to live in Carton.  I live near Carton and come in here every day.  Leinster House does inspire the brightest ideas.  I have never come here on any one day when I did not learn something or was not inspired.  Parliament has a huge role to play, and maybe, based on events of recent days, an increasing role, as it appears that many in the permanent Government are dysfunctional and require the intervention of Ministers and the Taoiseach in certain Departments.  We have a vital role to play.  That vital role was expressed in the debate by the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins.  Blocking legislation is not what the Seanad is about.  Improving and enhancing legislation is the key contribution we make to the legislative process.  At the time Senator Cummins made his contribution, the House had proposed more than 600 amendments, and we have not slowed down much since then.<\/p><p>We have a House which was endorsed by the public in a referendum against all the odds.<\/p> <p>Others Bills have come from Senator Zappone, Senator Crown and the Government.  In this Bill we seek to move the process of reform forward and to retain and enhance the Seanad as public opinion indicated so recently.<br \/>The father of the House, Senator Norris, is indisposed.  In a sense, this is Hamlet without the prince.  However, he asked me to pass on his regards and this statement:<blockquote>First of all, let me say there should be full reform of the Seanad and I believe this Bill to be an important part of such reform.  Of all the groups within the Seanad the university seats have played the most significant role.  The are the most democratic and least elitist because one does not have to be a graduate to stand for election.  This will be equally true if this Bill is passed.  Anyone from the education and cultural panel would have the right to stand for the education seats.  No one would be denied this important right.  The Government's reaction to this Bill will be a true test of their sincerity in addressing reform of the Seanad.  I am very grateful to Professor Barrett for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this important debate.<\/blockquote>That is the end of the statement from the father of the House, Senator Norris.<br \/>We are proposing to create eight seats on the cultural and educational panel, four more seats for the universities and institutes of higher education, and four seats for educational and cultural representation.  The advice we have from Eoin O'Dell of Trinity College Dublin is that this is constitutional.  It maintains the voice of small groupings and keeps room for non-party participants in the political process.  It fills the void left by the absence of a cross-bench tradition in the Seanad.  It keeps the Parliament open to important segments of society, which we found significant during the referendum.  In all the college debates we found that young people overwhelmingly wanted the Seanad kept.  They aspired to fill the university seats later in their careers.  We found decidedly strong support in Dublin working class areas.  Places where all five Members of the D&aacute;il campaigned for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote had a 68% &quot;No&quot; vote, including Dublin Central and Dublin South-West.  There is a strong wish to have independent voices in the House.<br \/>I will be speaking in Belfast this evening.  We found that Northern voters in the Seanad election were somewhat annoyed that they were about to be deprived of their vote for Leinster House and the Oireachtas in a referendum in which they had no vote, because the register used in the referendum was the D&aacute;il register.  I believe that is why the Donegal constituencies voted &quot;No&quot;.  The people there have strong connections with Northern Ireland.  People in the North got their friends, relations, neighbours, people in the places where they spend their holidays and so on to vote &quot;No&quot;.  These were all important segments which, among others, wanted the House to be retained and developed.<br \/>We believe the Bill is constitutional.  Article 18.1 states: &quot;Seanad &Eacute;ireann shall be composed of sixty members, of whom eleven shall be nominated members and forty-nine shall be elected members.&quot;  Article 18.4.1&deg; states:<blockquote>i Three shall be elected by the National University of Ireland.<br \/>ii Three shall be elected by the University of Dublin.<br \/>iii Forty-three shall be elected from panels of candidates constituted as hereinafter provided.<\/blockquote>Article 18.7.1&deg; states &quot;five panels of candidates shall be formed in the manner provided by law...&quot;.  We provide by law for one of those panels which, we believe, could create the cultural and educational panel to which I have referred.  The panels are listed in the article.  Article 18.10.1&deg; states &quot;Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article elections of the elected members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann shall be regulated by law&quot;.<br \/>We hope the Bill we are proposing goes forward with the Bills proposed by the Government, Senator Crown and Senator Zappone.  It should go for consideration as part of the overall package of reforming the House.<br \/>One difficulty we see with the proposals currently being examined in the franchise section of the Department is the creation of a constituency with up to 870,000 voters.  This corresponds to the election of 40 D&aacute;il Deputies.  It would be an immense constituency.  Our fear is that the independent voices - the young people who run for election who have recently graduated and so on - would be unable to face the expense of such a large constituency.  For example, Carlow-Kilkenny has five seats for approximately 105,000 voters and, therefore, we estimate a 870,000-voter constituency would be of such a size as to elect 40 D&aacute;il Deputies.  We believe this will be a major deterrent.<br \/>If the political parties take over the two university constituencies, the great contribution that has been made since the beginning by the university seats will be lost.  Let us consider the tradition of Mary Robinson and Owen Sheehy-Skeffington's opposition to corporal punishment in schools, as well as William Bedell Stanford's attempt to promote North-South trade in the 1940s when we had customs barriers and so on.  The liberal agenda, personified by Senators David Norris, Mary Robinson and so on, will be lost.  The essence of this House will be lost if the political parties take over this immense constituency.  I cannot see many others being able to afford to run.  The former Trinity College provost John Henry Bernard discussed this when he went to see Arthur Griffith in 1922 and it was agreed by Mr. de Valera in the 1937 Constitution.  The liberal voice and the non-majoritarian voice has served this country well.  It helps to maintain vital Northern Ireland links as we configure what Ireland will look like in future, as well as better relations between the two parts of Ireland.  These are improving all the time.  The loss of the two university constituencies would prove the case the Government was making in the October referendum in respect of the Seanad being composed of Fianna F&aacute;il lite, Labour Party lite and Fine Gael lite.  There would be no independent voice or unique role such as that played by those who have taken the university seats.  If we allow that to happen I believe we would seriously damage the Seanad and not live up to the spirit and aspirations of the people, some 643,000 of whom endorsed the House last October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400022#W00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400074500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I have great pleasure in supporting and seconding Senator Barrett's Bill.  I believe Senator Barrett, more than any of us, represents the epitome of the intention of the Seanad - that is, to bring expertise unencumbered by the discipline and requirements of political party membership into the halls of Parliament where it can be brought to bear in areas of special interest.<\/p><p>In truth, one has to wonder, had there had been more people like Senator Barrett tramping these corridors in the past decade or decade and a half, is there a chance we would have found ourselves with a greater critical mass of expertise in economic, financial, banking and commercial matters in the House?  Would our Government have been in a stronger and better position to analyse, diagnose and correct the problems that have caused such pain to so many people in the country?  It is primarily for this reason that I became vehemently supportive of the notion of Seanad reform as opposed to Seanad abolition.  These were the two options I put in my election leaflet in 2011.  I stated that the Seanad as currently constituted was unsustainable and that it needed to be either abolished or reformed.<\/p> <p>As a Member of this House, it strikes me that we need to give the whole reform agenda a good go, because we have a real opportunity here.  When one considers the problems and dysfunctions that have beset the D&aacute;il, it is clear how difficult they will be to fix.  By having the entirety of our generally mandated and generally enfranchised electorate electing politicians on the basis of geographical constituencies, there is an inevitable tendency for those politicians to be mostly concerned with representing their constituency, which they do very well.  The system means, however, that we have a deficit of people in the Lower House who are elected with a specifically national outlook, but it is from this available group that our Ministers must be selected.  As it happens, we often get very good Ministers.  Sometimes, however, looking across the spectrum of people who have occupied the positions over the years, one would have to say that some of them were rather inexpert when they were appointed.  I am not looking at the Minister of State when I say this.  He is very expert.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400023#X00200","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400075100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I am smiling because I agree with some of the things the Senator is saying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400024#Y00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075100,"counter":286,"content":"<p>It is for these reasons that I espoused a very fundamental reform of the Seanad which, if it had been enacted, would have given us one nationally elected Chamber based on universal franchise.  It would have afforded an opportunity for people who are not heavily politically partisan in their orientation and involvement to come in greater numbers into the Chamber.  Realism dictates that the reform I have espoused will not happen.  Likewise, it is very unlikely that the similar and very high-quality reform espoused by Senators Katherine Zappone and Feargal Quinn will be enacted.  This is because all the power to enact changes in the law and Constitution rests in the hands of a very small number of people, in an inner sanctum at the Cabinet table.  In fact, that is the very problem we were hoping to address by way of the reforms we have proposed.<br \/>Having said that, it is good that we have an array of options available in order to keep the reform agenda alive.  Those of us who urged a &quot;No&quot; vote in the referendum to abolish the Seanad have since taken criticism because no reform has occurred.  In fact, the Bill produced by Senators Quinn and Zappone, my Bill and now Senator Barrett's Bill have all been put before the House at various points.  We have done our bit to honour our commitment of working for reform of the Seanad.  In that vein, I am strongly in favour of Senator Barrett's proposal advancing and forming part of the Government's consideration when it examines the possibility of Seanad reform.  Against a background of referendum fatigue, we are cognisant that all three of the proposals that have been brought forward, as well as the Fianna F&aacute;il proposal, could potentially be enacted on the basis of legislation without the requirement for any referendum-authorised changes to the Constitution.<br \/>I enthusiastically support Senator Barrett in his endeavours and am proud to second his proposal.  I hope the Government will give serious consideration to the results of the referendum last October.  It might be putting it too strongly to say that people voted overwhelmingly in support of the Seanad, but certainly they voted against all expectations, not for retention of the <i>status quo<\/i>but for a reformed Upper House.  Every indicator of opinion at the time showed there was a great hunger and appetite for reform.  Merely making some small changes will not be adequate, but any changes are none the less welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400024#Y00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I thank Senator Barrett for the statement he delivered from the father, or prince, of the House, Senator David Norris.  I wish him well in his recovery.  I compliment Senator Barrett on keeping the debate alive by putting this proposal on the agenda today.  The question of when the Seanad franchise will be extended has been one of the most talked about issues in recent months in the context of political reform.  It has been 21 years since the establishment of the University of Limerick and Dublin City University and even longer since the referendum was passed allowing for the extension of the third level franchise.  It is a great shame that no move has been made to implement reform in this regard before now.  What we are seeing are only baby steps, but after 21 years it is good to see something.<\/p><p>Back in March we debated the general scheme of the Government's Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill in this House.  Since then, the public consultation which followed on from the publication of those proposals has closed.  I look forward to what the Government comes up with when it collates all of the submissions it has received, its own proposals and the Bills introduced by Senators Crown, Quinn and Zappone, and Senator Barrett.  If this House is noted for one thing, it is its capacity to improve legislation.  It is only by listening to what people here are saying that the Government will come up with something better.<\/p><p>There is, of course, a great deal to be done and it is not a simple task.  Whenever Government tries to do something within the confines of legislation rather than the Constitution, it is working to some extent with its hands tied behind its back.  The Seanad was established under the Constitution and if we are to change it by legislation, it will only be changeable in certain elements.  Every Member of this particular Seanad has already seen some changes about the place.  It is notable, for example, that most of the 11 Taoiseach's nominees are not members of either party of government.  That change was a one-day wonder, forgotten about quickly like every piece of good news.  There is more to be done, but one cannot do everything in one day.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett's Bill recommends extending the university franchise to all third level institutions but with a different methodology for the traditional university seats.  He also proposes splitting the cultural and educational panel into two separate panels.  My concern is that by treating the new third level institutions to be included in the franchise differently, there might be a view that they are somehow yellow pack, in contrast to the &quot;real&quot; universities.  That is not something I want to see happening.  All the third level institutions should be on the same footing.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the institutions listed in the Senator's Bill correspond more or less exactly with the list contained in the Government proposal.  We all support the objective of extending the third level franchise but, as I said, I have concerns regarding the Senator's proposal to split the cultural and educational panel.  Education is not something that need be narrowly defined.  An industrial and cultural panel is also an educational panel and should include third level graduates.  I am not suggesting that the Senator is proposing that any particular panel be deemed to be lesser than any other.  However, assigning the newly-enfranchised institutions to a panel separate from the older universities might lead to problems.<\/p><p>My understanding of the technical provisions of the Bill is that there would be a two-year lead-in before the electoral arrangements would become operational.  This approach would effectively rule out any change before the next Seanad election, which I suspect is not the Senator's intention.  Will he clarify that?<\/p><p>Regarding the proposal to break up and reconstitute the panels, I see no problem with that being done by way of legislation.  A question arises, however, in respect of the designation of universities as returning officers under the existing provisions.  Would legislation on its own be sufficient to effect the changes envisaged in Senator Barrett's proposals without altering the theory, so to speak, of the returning officer?  I suggest we could replicate legislation from Article 33 of the Free State Constitution to establish a cross-party or non-party system for representation of important interests and institutions in the country, but that is a matter for another day.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State indicate when the Government intends to publish its legislation on foot of the consultation process that recently concluded?<\/p> <p>The franchise is being extended to the remaining third level institutions and this means that an additional 73,000 people will have a vote.<\/p><p>I have a great deal more to say on the matter but time is against me.  I thank Senator Barrett for introducing the Bill but I must point out that there are many types of intelligence which it fails to contemplate.  I would like all forms of intelligence, and not just that contemplated by a university education, to be represented.  I am of the view that there are certain types of intelligence which are more important than that which comes from an academic education.  I will not list them all now but will instead wait until a later date to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400024#Y00400","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400075700,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I compliment Senator Barrett on introducing the Bill and I welcome the Minister of State.  Fianna F&aacute;il published its own Seanad reform Bill and remains committed to it.  However, we will be supporting the Senator's Bill because we are anxious to ensure that the issue of Seanad reform remains on the agenda.  We are happy to work with other Members in this regard and to find common ground with them.<br \/>Senator Barrett outlined his reasons for bringing forward this legislation.  I am of the view that the Bill raises a number of fundamental questions.  For example, its provisions will not affect the number of university seats - currently six - in the Seanad.  The Government has already agreed to enact a law, pursuant to a referendum held some years ago, to extend the franchise.  Senator Barrett's Bill would ensure that the franchise would be extended even further and that seats would be added.  In that context, the fact that the division of the existing cultural and educational panel into two new constituencies in order to provide for the election of four Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann from the educational constituency of the cultural and educational panel by the holders of degrees from third level institutions other than the National University of Ireland and the University of Dublin, suggests that ten Senators would be elected by those with third level degrees.  There will be those who will immediately shout that this smacks of elitism.<br \/>Whereas people might criticise the existing panel structure in terms of the fact that county councillors elect 43 Members of the House, I have always argued that there is a degree of extended democracy in this regard in that the Seanad electorate of councillors are elected by the people.  Those councillors have a mandate and members of the general public have every opportunity to question them on that mandate at the end of every five-year term.  However, they do not question them during that period.  In other words, once a councillor is elected and given a mandate, he or she can make up his or her own mind as to the decisions he or she will take while pursuing his or her duties as a councillor.  One of those duties is to elect Members of the Seanad.  This is an important democratic function.  I accept that the existing structure is flawed but it is not as deeply flawed as some might suggest.  There appears to be an impression that councillors are somehow irrelevant and that their being responsible for electing Members of this House is undemocratic.<br \/>If the Bill is accepted, ten Senators will be elected by those who have third level degrees.  That is a significant step to take and I will be interested to hear the Government's response to the proposal.  Fianna F&aacute;il has two primary aims when it comes to its proposals for the Seanad.  The first is that it should be a check on Government power and scrutinise national and EU legislation.  The second aim is that representation in the House should be broadened in order to provide a voice for groups which are not heard in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In that context and if Senator Barrett's Bill were accepted, a number of items of existing legislation would require amendment.  One of these is the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1965 (No. 1).  The Bill points out that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was incorporated under letters of patent dated 11 February 1784, which is a long time ago.  The Bill states:<blockquote>The professional interests for the purposes of the cultural constituency are hereby defined as&mdash;<br \/>(a) law, and<br \/>(b) medicine, including surgery, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmaceutical chemistry.<\/blockquote>Will Senator Barrett indicate why those particular categories are included?  Is the aim to bring graduates from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland into the mix to which the Senator referred?<br \/>Under the new section 90 which the Bill proposes to insert into the principal Act, it is stated:<blockquote>A member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann for the educational constituency may voluntarily resign his or her membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann by notice in writing to the Chairman of Seanad &Eacute;ireann who shall announce such resignation to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the next meeting thereof.<\/blockquote>However, the Bill is silent as to how the resulting vacancy should be filled.  I have often argued that whenever a vacancy occurs in the Seanad - and irrespective of the side of the House on which it occurs - the Government of the day effectively decides how it is filled.  Under the current by-election rules, the vote relating to a vacancy is confined to Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad and, inevitably, the Government of the day will have a majority.  I was re-elected to the House on that basis in a by-election held in 2010.  I was the nominee of the then Government and even though the other parties put forward their own candidates - and unless my colleagues had deserted me - my election was a given.  It was not my election but rather my nomination that was the achievement in that instance.  I wonder whether Senator Barrett has given any thought to changing the process relating to by-elections to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Perhaps the Bill could be amended in order that when vacancies arise, the relevant voters might be asked to elect replacements.  I am of the view that this would be a much more fair and equitable way to proceed.<br \/>That to which I refer could also be extended to county council elections.  I have never been a fan of the notion that the party in power takes responsibility for nominating replacement candidates.  I have always been of the view that we should re-adopt the British model which we previously abandoned in this regard.  Under that model, by-elections are held in particular wards or districts in order to fill local authority vacancies rather than their being filled internally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400025#Z00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075700,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and I commend Senator Barrett on taking the initiative by introducing this Private Members' Bill.  This debate is part of a bigger process whereby we are discussing Seanad reform on an ongoing basis.  It is very worthwhile to have technically well-drafted and comprehensive Bills before us when considering that issue.  I do not support the principle behind this Bill but I am in favour of the idea that we should discuss alternative models in the context of how we might implement the decision taken by the electorate in 1979 to ensure that graduates of all third level institutions might elect Senators.  It is extremely important, therefore, that we should be presented with different models before we develop a final plan as to how we might proceed.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Government has given a commitment to implement the 1979 amendment to the Constitution by broadening the electorate relating to the university seats.  It has suggested the establishment of one six-person university panel.  The Labour Party Senators made a proposal in respect of Seanad reform to the Parliamentary Labour Party in which we called for the latter.  Very importantly, however, we also called for reforms to the five vocational panels.  I absolutely agree with Senator Barrett that - as he has pointed out on many occasions - there should not be a single, stand-alone reform in respect of the six university seats and that there must be broader reforms in respect of the other seats in this House.  We can make significant changes to the five vocational panels by way of legislation and without further constitutional amendment.  We have debated this matter on many occasions and we all accept that there will not be a further referendum on Seanad reform during the lifetime of the Government.  As a result, some aspects - including that which relates to the Taoiseach's 11 nominees - cannot be altered in the next two years.  It is clear, however, that amendments to the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Acts 1947 to 2006 could be introduced - without the need for a constitutional referendum - in order to allow changes to be made to the composition of the five vocational panels which are provided for under Article 18.7 of the Constitution.<\/p><p>The Labour Party Senators proposed to the Parliamentary Labour Party that a panel should be established in respect of the six university seats and that those who will hold those seats in the future should be elected by the graduates of all third level institutions.  I will return to that matter in a moment.  We also suggested that the method of election relating to the other panels be changed in order to ensure universal suffrage.  We are still pushing this in Government circles because the proposal in question is hugely important.<\/p> <p>Each person entitled to vote - we are open as to whether this should be as per the local, European or general election register - would have a separate vote for candidates on each of the five panels and university graduates, rather than having an additional franchise, could opt for a vote on the university panel instead of one of the other panels, so that they would have the same number of votes as everybody else but have the option for voting for the university panel.<\/p><p>In accordance with Article 19 of the Constitution, we recommended that one panel could be reserved for election not by universal suffrage but by city and county council members so as to preserve the current valuable link between local representatives and government.  It is proposed that this be preserved for only one panel, perhaps the Public Administration Panel.  We also recommended some provision for gender balance on the panels by extending the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act to require nominating bodies to select at least 30% of their candidates from each gender.  Further, we suggested that the panel vote could take place on an all-Ireland or regional basis, in line with the European constituencies so that the electorate and those elected would be of a very different composition to those in D&aacute;il elections.  A real concern at Government level, which I believe is a justified concern, is that there would not be duplication in a Seanad elected through universal suffrage with the D&aacute;il.  In other words, we should not seek to simply reproduce the geographical representation of the D&aacute;il.  There are ways we can get around this while allowing for universal suffrage. <\/p><p>I have outlined what was proposed in detail because that is the method of reform which I favour and that has been agreed upon by the Labour Party Senators group.  It is for this reason I could not support the proposal put forward in Senator Barrett's Bill, although I believe it has some merit.  It certainly makes us think about how we can best ensure representation for university graduates.  I am grateful also to the board of Trinity College which supplied all Dublin University Senators with a copy of its submission on 7 April to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Senator Barrett's Bill is based on one of the models put forward in the Trinity College submission, which again is very valuable in that it makes us examine closely how best to ensure representation for graduates of all universities.<\/p><p>The Trinity model suggests that extending the single six-person panel to graduates of all the universities will be problematic for a number of reasons.  The Government needs to take this on board.  Again, Senator Barrett's Bill would address this issue.  It is suggested by Trinity that the single six-person expanded constituency currently proposed by Government to replace the two current constituencies of NUI and Dublin University would be extremely difficult to administer, would have significant financial implications and would discourage some eligible candidates from running for election, while weakening the relationship between elected Senators and their constituency.  As a Dublin University Senator, I have some sympathy with this view.  There are some pertinent points put forward by the Trinity board.  On a practical level, based on the last census of the number of graduates in this country, there would be 750,000 citizens entitled to vote for one six-person panel.  This would be an enormously difficult electorate to administer for only six seats.  Again, Senator Barrett has taken this on board in his Bill.  On a practical level, there is likely to be more than 45 candidates put forward.  In the previous election, there were 19 candidates on the Trinity College ballot paper and 26 on the NUI ballot paper.  In terms of what is proposed, graduates from 80 institutions would be entitled to vote in a new expanded constituency.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Barrett for bringing forward this Bill.  On behalf of this side of the House, I hope that the Bill will be allowed to proceed to the next Stage.  I do not believe it appropriate that we would divide on this.  All of us appreciate that there are merits in the proposal.  It is vital we would all have an opportunity to examine alternative models for implementing the decision of the people in 1979 and the decision of the Government to ensure that graduates of all third level institutions would be entitled to vote in Seanad elections.  The model put forward by Senator Barrett is but one of the models put forward in the Trinity submission, which I would urge colleagues to read.  I can supply a copy of it to those who do not have one.  Trinity has also put forward other alternative ways in which graduates of all the institutions would be able to elect Senators.  The Government should closely examine whether the six-person panel is the best method.  I look forward to further engagement on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400025#Z00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400076300,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to the Chamber.  I commend Senator Barrett for bringing forward this Bill and allowing us to again discuss the future of the Seanad.  Since the referendum of October 2013 we have not had any real reform of the Seanad, which is what people voted for when they went to the polls in the Seanad referendum.<\/p><p>I will not be supporting this Bill.  Prior to, during and since the referendum campaign I have been at pains to point out that from my perspective, there is something rotten at the core of the Seanad.  What is rotten at the core of the Seanad is how we are all elected, from those elected by city and county councillors through the various panels to the university panels elected by third and fourth level graduates and those appointed by the Taoiseach of the day.  I see this as an affront to democracy.  For the Seanad to have any future, be representative of the people and be inclusive, we must have a one person, one vote system.  The reality is that 99% of the population of this State cannot vote for Senators.  This being the case, how then can we expect the public to have any faith or interest in what the Seanad does or in the Senators who represent them?  That is not to take away from the good work done by many Senators, including those in my own party and all parties and none and, including those appointed by the Taoiseach on this occasion and by previous Taoisigh.  <\/p><p>It was universally accepted during the course of the referendum campaign that the Seanad in its current form had to go.  It was also universally accepted that the Seanad in its current form is elitist, undemocratic and unacceptable.  I fail to see how retaining the university panels and extending the franchise to additional university graduates is in any way removing the elitist nature of the Seanad.  In my view it deepens and copperfastens it and makes it worse.  To accept this legislation as a step forward would be for us to not acknowledge that there is something rotten at the core of the Seanad, namely, how we are elected.  I cannot go along with half measures or proposed changes that do not deal with the real issue at the heart of the Seanad.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware that Sinn F&eacute;in called for the future of the Seanad to be a matter for discussion by the Constitutional Convention, which has completed its work.  In my view, the Constitutional Convention did a very good job and came up with solid proposals for the Government to put to the people by way of referendum.  There were many issues with which the previous Constitutional Convention was not able to deal because of its remit and the timeframe involved.  Given the success of the recent Constitutional Convention - everybody from all parties and none agrees it was a success - there is scope for a second Constitutional Convention to consider the range of issues which could not be considered by the previous one, including reform of the Seanad.  I have no doubt that the majority of citizens on a Constitutional Convention would support a one person one vote system.  <\/p><p>We also need to ensure that consideration is given to the future of the Seanad in an all-Ireland context.  Again, there appeared to be universal acceptance across all parties and none, with a few exceptions, that those resident outside the State, including the Irish diaspora and those living in the North of Ireland, should be able to vote in Seanad elections.  This means citizens who live outside this State will have an opportunity to have an input into decision making in this State.  Many people would argue that extending the vote in general elections to the Irish diaspora might be a step too far.  However, giving them a vote in Seanad elections is a matter worthy of consideration.<\/p><p>There are a number of ways in which we could change the panels.<\/p> <p>By their nature, the sectoral panels have not worked.  Let us be honest - they have been hijacked by the political parties.  Is there any Senator who has not been elected by his or her own party?  There has not been a single Independent from the city and county council route - they have all come from the political parties.  This will be the case as long as the system remains as is.  We could have sectoral panels with a one person, one vote system.  The constituencies could be geographical, albeit not as large as those in the European Parliament, which many view as being too large.  Instead, we could have four or five geographical constituencies.<\/p><p>Much needs to be done and we cannot accept the Seanad remaining as is, because to do so would be to ensure the continuance of what was wrong.  Tinkering around the edges will not be enough.  I am sorry that I cannot support Senator Barrett's Bill.  I commend him, as he has pushed for genuine reform of the Seanad.  He views the Bill as something that would be of value to the State, but it would not, as it would reinforce the Seanad's elitist element, which should be removed.<\/p><p>I am not just focusing on the university seats, as the way in which I was elected should also be scrapped.

I would love to get rid of that.  There must be a way to do so.<\/p><p>As Senator Walsh reminds us, from 1994 to 1997 the Taoiseach's nominees stayed the same despite the change of Taoiseach.  For once, the Government did not have a majority.  The five of us in the university seats had the balance of power, which is a powerful thing to have.  The legislation that came through during the period was very good.  Part of the reason is because there was no Whip.  This would be a stronger House if we had more Independent Members as opposed to Members who are obliged to take the Whip.  If one looks at the university seats in more recent years, one sees people like Mary Robinson and Senators David Norris, John Crown and Sean Barrett.  These are people who would not easily have been elected in a constituency.  From that point of view, it has worked very well.<\/p><p>The reason I mention Senator Barrett's Bill in particular is that there have been a number of other Bills.  Senator Zappone's Bill, which I supported, has been passed in the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a Bill, as does Senator Crown, whose Bill has gone through.  Each Bill provides us with an opportunity to consider alternatives.  The Bills consider whether we can have change in the House without another referendum.  The Taoiseach is unlikely to show any enthusiasm for another referendum.  As such, Senator Barrett has provided for change in his Bill without the need for another referendum.  It leaves the six university seats in place but provides for seats for the other higher education institutions.  If we get that sort of legislation through, it will strengthen the Houses and democracy.  The current form is not working.  Senator Cullinane said the Seanad in its current form must go.  It will not go easily, but we can make changes now.  Perhaps it is only tampering, but it is to do something which strengthens the House.<\/p><p>I welcome Senator Barrett's proposal.  We desperately need the Government to respect the will of the people and provide them with meaningful Seanad reform.  They are not getting that at the moment.  The way the Government is approaching reform is slow and wrong.  The Government Bill on Seanad reform - the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill - will merely reform arrangements for six Members elected by institutions of higher education.  That is all it will do.  That Bill means that 90% of the 60 seat Seanad would be left unreformed.  The Government Bill will also maintain a Seanad electoral system whose underlying principle appears to be &quot;one councillor, five votes&quot;.  This is the part that really gets me.  I would like to think that almost everyone who gets a visit from a canvasser in the next week before the local authority elections will ask candidates if they are in favour of having five votes where citizens have no vote, unless they are university graduates.  I ask each elector to say that to everyone who knocks on his or her door to look for a vote in the local authority elections.  That change must take place.  I am a believer in the university seats and in extending the franchise to all other third level colleges.<\/p><p>By appointing people who were not party-political hacks, the Taoiseach showed that he could follow up.  The House has done great work in the past and can continue to do so.  I hope the Minister accepts the legislation to get it to the next Stage, even if changes must take place on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400027#BB01900","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400077500,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I dtosach, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le Senator Barrett as ucht an Bille seo a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an tSeanaid.  C&eacute; nach bfhuil an Rialtas ag glacadh leis an mBille, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht leathan againn agus gur f&eacute;idir le Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; &oacute; gach taobh den Teach a dtuairim&iacute; a nochtadh.  Tuigeann muid go l&eacute;ir gur &eacute; tuairim muintir na h&Eacute;ireann gur c&oacute;ir go mbeadh an Seanad beo anseo i gc&oacute;na&iacute; agus chun sin a chinnti&uacute; go dtiocfaidh athr&uacute; air.  Go h&aacute;irithe, caithfimid f&eacute;achaint ar an gceist seo.  We are currently engaged in a process of reforming arrangements for the election of Members of the Seanad, particularly by the institutions of higher education in the State.  Debate leads to better policy and Senator Barrett's Bill provides us with a chance to examine alternative approaches.  This can only enhance the policy-making process.<\/p><p>The Government does not agree with the proposal which is at the centre of the Bill.  The proposal is to increase the number of Members of the Seanad elected by the universities and institutions of higher education by reducing the number of Senators elected from four of the five vocational panels.  The Government has already set out its approach to electoral reform.  The general scheme of a Bill to implement the 1979 constitutional amendment to extend the right to vote to graduates of other colleges was approved by the Government and published for consultation on 14 February 2014.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, outlined to the House on 11 March 2014 the provisions contained in the general scheme and heard the views of Members of the Seanad on its contents.  That session was productive and there were useful contributions and observations from all sides.<\/p><p>Today's Second Stage debate is about the Bill Senator Barrett has placed before us.  The Bill would result in the retention of the two university constituencies in their current form.  The University of Dublin - Trinity College - and the National University of Ireland would continue to elect three Senators each.  The Bill proposes that the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Acts be amended to provide for a reduction in the number of Members to be elected from four of the five vocational panels and the introduction of a new educational constituency.  Four Senators would be elected from this new constituency comprising graduates of those institutions of higher education not included in the current university constituencies.  The new educational constituency would be formed within the cultural and educational panel which would increase in size from five to eight seats.<\/p><p>To provide for this, three of the other panels - Agricultural, Labour and Industrial and Commercial - would each lose one seat.  The Administrative Panel would be unchanged.  With four of the eight seats on the Cultural and Education Panel to be elected by higher education graduates, this panel would also effectively lose one seat.  The revised composition of the Cultural and Educational Panel would therefore be as follows; four seats would be elected by the newly-formed educational constituency comprising the University of Limerick, Dublin City University, the institutes of technology, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and other colleges recognised by the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland; and the four other seats would be elected from what is described as &quot;the cultural constituency&quot;.  As a result, the education element of the Cultural and Educational Panel would have a predominant emphasis on higher education, which although important, is only one part of a much broader education sector.  The combined educational and cultural representation in the Seanad, when the current university Senators are included, would rise to 14.  This would be greater than for the other vocational sectors.  The Agricultural Panel would have ten seats, a reduction of one; the Labour Panel would now have ten seats, also a reduction of one; the Industrial and Commercial Panel would have eight seats, again a reduction of one; and the Administrative Panel would be unchanged with seven seats.<\/p><p>The approach in the Private Members' Bill before us is not consistent with the provisions contained in the general scheme of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill approved by the Government and published in February.<\/p> <p>The general scheme is part of the legislative process to implement the 1979 amendment to the Constitution that provided for the reorganisation of the existing university constituencies and the extension of the franchise to other institutions of higher education in the State.  The 1979 constitutional amendment relates specifically to the six university senators.  It looks as though the Bill goes beyond the parameters envisaged in the amendment.  Instead of amending the existing university constituencies, the Bill proposes a reorganisation of the vocational panels.  It does not, therefore, adequately address the 1979 amendment.  Passage of the Bill would result in the retention of inequalities.  The two existing university constituencies, although substantially different in terms of their size, would continue to elect three Senators each.  While the right to vote in Seanad elections would be extended to graduates of other institutions of higher education, this would be at the expense of the current vocational panels and lead to a diminution in their representation.  Therefore, one sixth of the Seanad would be elected by institutions of higher education under the Bill.  This raises the question of whether the composition of the Seanad would reflect the intention of the drafters of the Constitution, who provided for six Senators to be elected by such institutions.<\/p><p>The Government's approach provides that each graduate would have one vote in the election of university Members.  This is a matter of principle underpinning the general scheme of the Government's Bill.  It would bring a greater element of equality to the current system, under which a person who is a graduate of both NUI and Trinity College can vote in each of the constituencies.  The Bill we are discussing would preserve the present arrangements and potentially enhance the existing inequalities.  Based on the Bill as presented, a graduate could potentially vote in what would become three university and higher education constituencies if they had a degree from a college in each of the constituencies.  I note that there is a prohibition on a candidate seeking election in more than one of these three constituencies.<\/p><p>There are a number of significant differences between Senator Barrett's Bill and the Government's Bill, which provides for a six-seat constituency for institutions of higher education to replace the present NUI and University of Dublin constituencies.  All holders of a qualification at ordinary degree level or equivalent would to be entitled to register to vote in the constituency.  There would be a single register of electors, with every voter having only one vote no matter how many qualifications he or she holds.  There is provision for an updated nomination process to require 40 instead of ten assenters to support a nomination or, alternatively, payment of a deposit of &euro;900.  As a further measure, new arrangements are proposed for the filling of casual vacancies.  These are to be modelled on the replacement candidate provisions for European Parliament elections.<\/p><p>As well as being forwarded to the Seanad for consideration, a copy of the general scheme was sent to the Cathaoirleach of the Oireachtas Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the consideration of the committee.  Copies were sent to the 81 institutions of higher education, inviting their views.  The general scheme was also published on the Department's website in order for the wider public to make submissions.  The 21 submissions received have been published and I note that one of them was from Senator Barrett.  I also acknowledge that other Members of the House have made submissions, and these are welcome.<\/p><p>In parallel with the consultation process, there are practical issues that must be addressed.  Aside from questions of policy, the modalities of voter registration and the running of elections will give rise to particular administrative challenges, especially given the scale of change to the electorate that is envisaged.  A technical working group has been established, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which includes nominees from the Department of Education and Skills, the National University of Ireland, Trinity College, the Irish Universities Association, Institutes of Technology Ireland and the Higher Education Colleges Association.  The group has met on four occasions and has provided important and useful input.  All of this work is progressing well and represents a better and more focused opportunity for reform.<\/p><p>I would like to address some of the technical provisions contained in section 6.  I refer to the new sections 88 and 89 of what would become the amended Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Acts.  The sections deal with the compilation of the register and the appointment of a returning officer.  The Bill provides that each institution retain its own register and that the returning officer be selected by the presidents of the institutions.<\/p><p>The provisions envisage a two year lead-in time before the new electoral arrangements would become operational - as described in the Bill, &quot;the year second next after the commencement of this Act&quot;.  This approach would rule out any change before the next Seanad general election.  The Government's scheme has been published with the intention of progressing it as soon as possible.  This, we believe, is a more ambitious approach to implementing reform.  <\/p><p>The Private Members' Bill is definitely welcome.  It seriously adds to the level of debate and interest, but we believe it contains too many provisions as it is presently constituted.  The Government has set out its own position.  However, the Bill before us offers an alternative approach to representation in the Seanad from the so-called other institutions of higher education in the State that the Government does not agree with.  We believe that it would create more problems than it purports to address.<\/p><p>Along with some of my colleagues, I have been a Member of Seanad for five years, since 1997.  Therefore, I can say that at every debate the input from all Members, but particularly from university Senators, has always been enlightening, interesting and informative.  They have made and continue to make a very significant contribution to public debate, and indeed to explaining the political processes.  They are often interpreted in an independent and intellectual way, and they do put the issues out there, which is welcome. <\/p><p>Finally, I send my good wishes to Senator Norris, like other Members of the House.  I have not been here since he was in hospital, but we wish him well.  I also thank Senator Barrett for increasing the range of ideas and opportunities through this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400028#CC00200","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400078100,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I liked the words used by the Minister of State when he described our contribution as being always \"enlightening, interesting and informative,\" and I wrote them down.  I thank him for his response and I also thank my colleagues here for their contributions.<\/p><p>In a personal sense, I have made 59 new friends since I joined the other Members of the Seanad three years ago.  That is why the place has been endorsed by the public and that is why it is important that the Seanad goes forward in the way in which the Minister of State aspires for it.  I am afraid the proposal of a single mega-constituency would allow the political parties to take over the university seats.  As he said, having an alternative is absolutely vital.  We need people who are not involved in political parties and we need representation of minorities.  As he said, we need expertise, and I am afraid we would lose it if we had 870,000 voters in a mega-constituency.  I thank him for the courtesy that he always shows us in the House and for his regular appearances here.<\/p><p>The Minister of State's speech as originally circulated, although I think it was corrected afterwards, stated: &quot;The combined educational and cultural representation in the Seanad, when the current university Senators are included, would rise to 14,&quot; but it later states: &quot;one sixth of the Seanad would be elected by institutions of higher education.&quot;  That means the number would be ten and not 14.  That is the kind of technical matter that we will be discussing as the debate advances.  <\/p><p>I will now thank the speakers in the order in which they addressed us.  Senator Keane stressed the importance of keeping this debate alive and mentioned our role in consultation and improving legislation.  There is no yellow-pack university, but we have given all institutions of higher education a constituency in this legislation, which is important.  <\/p><p>With regard to Senator Mooney's comments, in our constituencies it is important to have by-elections.  The Government proposed that there be a list system and that the next person on the list be selected.  I opposed that proposal in European elections as well.  By-elections play an important part in the electoral process.  One of the observations I sent to the Minister, to which he referred, was that there should be by-elections for the Seanad, rather than a system in which the next person on a list is chosen to fill vacancies.  That is a fault with the European elections that should not be adopted in Oireachtas elections.  It might also run into constitutional problems.<\/p><p>I thank all contributors for their views and I shall finish with a minute outstanding.  I thank again, most sincerely, everybody in the House.  I value this House hugely.  Everything that I have proposed here, and in the Bill, is to ensure this House continues to expand and help Ministers and the Taoiseach in the governance of this country, for the reasons that I have mentioned.  We have played a fantastic role since 1922 and since 1937.  Long may it continue.  I hope the independent university Senators are not lost, because I value them, just as the Minister does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400029#DD00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400078100,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 4.50 p.m. and resumed at 7.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Establishment of Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis: Motion","time":1400078700,"counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400030#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1400078700,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/>(1) That, having regard to section 12 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 and Standing Order 103C, a Select Committee be appointed, to be joined with a similar Select Committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to form the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, to develop a relevant proposal for conducting a &lsquo;Part 2 Inquiry&rsquo; into certain aspects of the banking crisis for submission to, and evaluation by, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges under Standing Orders 103B and 103D.<br \/>(2) In developing the relevant proposal, the Joint Committee shall consider&mdash;(<i>a<\/i>) the appropriate scope and terms of reference for any such Inquiry to be conducted, including the method by which the initial investigation into the matter the subject of the Inquiry should be made,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the functions and powers required to be delegated to the Joint Committee to allow it to conduct such an Inquiry, and<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) such other related matters as the Joint Committee considers necessary.(3) (<i>a<\/i>) The Select Committee shall consist of two (2) members who shall be nominated in accordance with Standing Order 89 and the provisions of Standing Orders 80(1) and (2) shall not apply.(<i>b<\/i>) The Chairman of the Joint Committee shall be a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.(4) The quorum of the Joint Committee shall be five (5), of whom at least one shall be a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and that quorum shall be present for the duration of all meetings of the Committee.<br \/>(5) The Joint Committee shall have the following powers&mdash;(<i>a<\/i>) the powers defined in Standing Order 71(1), (2), (2A), (4), (5), (7), (8) and (9); and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the power to nominate persons to assist it in its deliberations; and such persons shall attend such meetings as the Joint Committee may determine.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400030#FF00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1400078700,"counter":319,"content":"<p>It has been a number of weeks since my visit to the Seanad dealing with Standing Orders to set up this committee.  The people of Ireland have suffered as a result the banking crisis.  Hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs and those who did not saw their lives change in other negative ways.  As a country, we were stripped of our economic sovereignty.  The Irish nation suffered the shame and indignity of having to be bailed out and witnessing the arrival of the troika.<\/p><p>As a Government and a Parliament, we have worked hard over the last three years to tackle the consequences of the banking crisis and the economic collapse.  Progress has been made and we are along the road to recovery.  Ireland successfully exited the EU-IMF programme last December, has returned to the international bond markets at historically low interest rates, has regained competitiveness and is once again recognised internationally as a fantastic location for investment and jobs.  Ireland's economy is growing and unemployment has declined from a high of over 15% to 11.7% at the end of April.  These are positive steps in the right direction but we still have a long way to go.  While economic recovery and job creation have been the priority, it is also important that we understand what led us into the economic collapse.  In these circumstances, the Government believes the Irish people are entitled to a full account of the banking crisis.  The Oireachtas is the Parliament of the people.  An investigation through an Oireachtas committee is the most appropriate way to establish the full truth about the collapse of the Irish banking system and the economic crisis that followed.<\/p><p>It will be a matter for the members of the committee to propose what the inquiry will consider and provide draft terms of reference for the Oireachtas to approve.  The decisions surrounding the bank bailout, the actions of bankers, auditors and regulators and the Government policies that led us to the economic collapse, such as light touch regulation, are some of the items that the committee members may consider.  The people who made these policy decisions and those who implemented the policies should come before the elected representatives of the people of Ireland and explain their role in the economic collapse.  I have been working closely with the Whips of the political parties and the Technical Group in the D&aacute;il on the establishment of the D&aacute;il select committee.  There is a cross-party commitment to this Oireachtas inquiry, as seen in the Deputies appointed members of the committee.  I have no doubt that this House will match that by appointing excellent Senators to the committee.  It is in the best interest of all Members of this Oireachtas, from all parties and none, that the inquiry is successful.<\/p><p>An inquiry that provides a comprehensive set of reports into the origins and underlying causes of the banking crisis and the resulting economic collapse will play a significant role in guaranteeing that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.  The Government introduced a Bill to amend the Constitution to establish an Oireachtas inquiry system in 2011 but the referendum held in October that year was defeated.  As a result, new legislation was required and the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill was passed in July 2013.  New Standing Orders required under the Act were approved by the D&aacute;il and Seanad in January and February 2014.  These Standing Orders create the parliamentary framework for establishing an inquiry, including how inquiries are set up, guidelines on how to conduct inquiries, compellability consent, oversight powers on the inquiry, and how any allegations of bias are addressed.  The foundations are now in place to hold a banking inquiry.<\/p><p>Earlier, the D&aacute;il established a select committee with seven members.  The Seanad is now being asked to establish a select committee with two members.  The new joint committee; chaired by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, will submit proposals to hold an inquiry, including draft terms of reference for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider and recommend for approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The next phase will involve gathering of relevant information, after which the committee will analyse the information and conduct oral hearings before submitting a draft report to both Houses.  This committee will show the public what can be achieved when Members of this Oireachtas work together for the good of the people.  It is the type of work that is carried out in committee rooms in this building every week but gets little attention.  The representatives of the Irish people have the right, the authority and a moral obligation to inquire into the greatest collapse to befall this country in recent times.  I wish Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and the Deputies and Senators selected to be members of the committee well in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400030#FF00300","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1400079300,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  <br \/>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the establishment of the banking inquiry in its general format.  However, a parliamentary inquiry on its own does not go far enough and will be precluded from fully investigating what happened during the collapse of the banking sector in Ireland.  The people will not be satisfied with a parliamentary inquiry which, in theory, will not have adequate teeth to fully investigate what happened.  Questions will be asked if the banking inquiry will follow on a report published in March 2011.  We now have a committee of inquiry, but it is made up of Members of the Oireachtas.  The question has to be asked whether the people will accept politicians on a partisan basis, under the party Whip system, making decisions in an investigation into what actually happened.  Questions are already being asked about the partisan nature of the committee.  It would be much better if the Oireachtas adopted a more hands-off approach in such an inquiry and if it was headed up by a High Court judge and given the necessary resources.  It would cost nothing more to go down that road and at least nobody would be able to say such an inquiry was partisan in nature.  Time will show that this was the wrong type of inquiry.  One only has to look at the Abbeylara inquiry into the death of John Carthy and what the Supreme Court in its ruling found that it had many shortcomings.  I would hate to think such an important issue as the collapse of the banking sector and the knock-on effect on the economy would be dealt with in a half-hearted way.<br \/>Let us look at Bank of Ireland.  Over a period of 200 years up to 1999 it lent about &euro;100 billion, but in the following ten years it lent the same amount.  There are questions that need to be asked.  As my time is limited, I want to touch on some of them.  <br \/>The terms of reference of the inquiry need to be established.  The parties in government will state the Government at the time should have called a halt.  Yes, that may be the case.  However, during the debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas in 2003 on the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act 2004 not one political party raised any question about the financial institutions or the banks.  In fact, the then Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton, now Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, said the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority could not be expected to ride shotgun with every bank and that banks had deep pockets to resource various wheezes.  In the long run only self-assessment and self-regulation would work, not trying to catch people out.<b><\/b>That is what those now in government said at the time.<br \/>To fully establish what went wrong, a number of key issues need to be investigated and included in the terms of reference which I understand are being established by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development failed to predict the onset of the financial crisis and their roles need to be fully investigated.  The processes by which the financial institutions individually became involved in the crisis and their auditing systems need to be investigated because, clearly, they were broken.  <br \/>The role of the ECB in the lead-up to the financial crisis and its culpability in assessing it by its cheap money policy needs to be queried.  What led to the bank guarantee?  What pressure was brought to bear on the ECB in respect of the bank guarantee and what was its role in insisting on none of the Irish banks failing?  <br \/>The events leading up to nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank in January 2009 needs to be investigated.  The decision to establish NAMA and its consequences, the events leading up to the bailout in 2010 and the role the European Central Bank played in this regard must also be investigated.  The attempts of the Government to get the ECB to agree to burden sharing, the reasons the ECB did not play ball in that regard and the decision to liquidise the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and its consequences are some of the issues that must be investigated.  If the inquiry is refined and narrow and simply covers the bank guarantee, we will only be letting the banks and bankers off the hook.  It needs to have teeth.  Given that we are having a parliamentary inquiry, these are some of the issues that need to be fully investigated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400031#GG00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1400079300,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.<\/p><p>I am pleased to support the motion to establish an Oireachtas committee to inquire into the banking crisis.

The people have endured a deep recession as a consequence which has been very difficult, demanding and painful for many.  People lost their jobs, some lost their homes and many of our young bright people were forced to emigrate.  Thankfully, unemployment has fallen from 15% to almost 11.5%.

The economy failed because of three constituencies: the banks and the financial services sector, the building and property development trades and the government, with a small \"g\".  Of those, the banks acted usually incompetently, sometimes possibly criminally, although that will be determined in other fora, but always in their self-interest.  There was something rational about the way the banks behaved at the time.  They found themselves in a situation whereby the country suddenly became flooded with cheap foreign credit and they did what bankers were doing throughout the world, namely, they incentivised their staff to sell loans to people which they could not afford.  People in the banks at all levels were getting bonuses for giving this kind of advice.<\/p><p>I had a conversation with a gentleman recently who was involved on the fringe of the whole process.  He maintained the problem in the country was that we all got greedy and offered the defence that everyone was to blame and therefore no one was to blame.  I do not buy that.  I do not believe we all got greedy.  Ordinary people throughout the length and breadth of the country did the same thing that their parents and grandparents did, namely, they bought a house.  The only difference was that they were told the rules had changed.  People who had received prudent advice for generations and over the years to the effect that one should only borrow 70% or 80% of the value of the house and that one should only borrow two or two and a half times the annual household income, were suddenly told that all those rules had gone, that one could borrow 100% on an interest-only basis and that it did not much matter whether this was five or six times a person's salary because in the past we had been too conservative.<\/p><p>People bought into this advice from a group that they had previously considered to be a priest class, that is, the bankers.  If we were asked who in every town in Ireland did we trust, we would say we trusted the teacher and the bank manager.  These were the pillars of the community and the people whose words meant something.  Suddenly, the view was that the advice being given was incorrect, it was wrong and it was being given for the self-interest of the bankers.  This is a question which, I imagine, will come out.  This is why I believe the great majority of the mis-steps taken by the banks will be found not to be criminal.  There were entirely legal, rational and foolish.<\/p><p>The case is similar with the building trade.  If people want houses, if there is a growing population and if people have access to cheap money, a builder will build the houses.  Furthermore, if generations of Governments have tried to put incentives in place to make people buy houses as opposed to renting properties, thus committing themselves in many cases to lengthy and unsustainable mortgages, then the builders will do it.  All of these people acted entirely rationally, although not very socially responsibly.<\/p><p>Who were the guilty parties?  The guilty parties were those in government.  I do not simply mean the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Progressive Democrats coalition.  I mean the process of government in the country.  I mean politicians from both sides of the aisles of both Houses and senior officials.  These were the people who were not supposed to act in their self-interest.  These were the people who were charged with the task of looking after the public interest.  These were the people who were supposed to rein in the natural exuberant tendencies of self-interest manifested by those who could gain profit from flogging their wares.  They were supposed to be our people in this equation and they failed.<\/p><p>I have no wish to be sectarian about it but it is obvious that those in the outgoing Government bore specific responsibility for this since they had been in power for much of the time.  However, the bleats of financial rectitude that we hear from those in the current Government ring hollow when one considers the fact that they never yelled &quot;Stop&quot;.  In fact, prominent persons in the current Government were pouring fuel on the fires of the mad house price bubble and inflation by making suggestions such as further reducing stamp duty and putting further incentives in place to enable people to take up mortgages which, ultimately, were unsustainable.  We also had the entire group of permanent government officials, civil servants and regulators.  It is now well known that there was not one person with a PhD in economics working in the front-line services of the Department of Finance on the night the bank guarantee was given.  It is outrageous and unacceptable.<\/p><p>I hope that the inquiry casts some light on the tragic events that have had such awful consequences for so many people in the country, but it cannot be too narrowly focused.  We cannot have another exercise whereby a whistleblower points out something which is found to be a problem and then everyone aims at the lowest level of accountability.  Accountability goes to the top in this case.  A little flame of light needs to be flickered onto some of these dark events and we cannot allow it to blow out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400031#GG00500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400079900,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

The Minister of State said that the people of Ireland have suffered as a result of the banking crisis.  As we all know, that is probably the understatement of the century.  The word \"suffered\" does not do justice to what the people have undergone over the past number of years as a result of the crisis or to what has come out since then.<\/p><p>We support the motion.  The Government has sat on the issue for the past number of years, but public opinion has now forced its hand.  It is approaching seven years since the first signs of the crisis appeared and in that time we have had four reports into the period, countless inches and columns of newspaper reports, books and television programmes.  Almost everyone is an expert on the issue at this stage and can articulate clearly what happened.  We are an educated citizenry on the financial and banking crisis and now at last, the Oireachtas is set to examine what happened over that period in a public way and to question those people involved at the time.<\/p><p>This motion involves the technical setting up of the committee and leaves much of the nitty gritty deals to the members of the committee in the context of its terms of reference and rules.  In the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in has nominated Deputy Pearse Doherty, our spokesman on finance, to the inquiry and I am confident he will be thorough and fair in his actions at all points as a member of the committee.  As some Members have said, we need to be honest about what this inquiry can deliver.  It will not be a substitute for a criminal investigation into those who presided over the banking crisis nor a substitute for convictions of bankers or jail sentences for those whose greed and incompetence brought the State to its knees, whether bankers, politicians, spectators or developers.  It will not make up for the mistakes of the past nor lift the burden from the people either.<\/p><p>The Minister of State said in his speech that the Irish nation suffered the shame and indignity of having to be bailed out.  It was not just that and the shame of the troika being brought in, but every day Irish people are suffering the shame and indignity of being evicted from their homes, having to seek emergency accommodation, having to beg for social welfare, having their medical cards taken from them and having to fight to get their sick children into hospitals.  This is the real shame and indignity resulting from the banking and financial crisis.  No inquiry nor anything we can do can make up for this.<\/p><p>There has not been much progress to date on recapitalising our pillar bank debt through the ESM, despite the announcement made in 2011 of the seismic shift and a game change.  Formalising the Anglo debt as sovereign debt has brought a burden for future generations of a debt that is not theirs.  This will affect children who are not even born yet.  An ESRI report has shown that young people and children suffered most deprivation during the recession.  When we consider the amount of the debt burden for them in the future, what effect will this have on them considering the already disproportionate and unequal effect of the recession on young people and children?<\/p><p>We support the motion and we will play a full role in the committee and ask the questions the people want us to ask and which need to be asked.  There is an issue with regard to empowering the committee to compel witnesses to come forward so as to get down to the business of establishing the truth.  We need the full co-operation of all parties involved in that regard, including the various sheltered accounting bodies and firms that have played a central role and which are still involved with many of our banks.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is here on behalf of the Taoiseach.  What are his thoughts on a recent reply from the ECB to my party colleague, Martina Anderson, MEP, in which the ECB expressed great alarm at the idea it had a role in the crisis, particularly its former president, Jean-Claude Trichet?

This is the suffering that has been inflicted on the people of the State by the Government.  The Minister of State stated correctly that this suffering is being endured by people because of the banking crisis.  However, the bankers have not suffered at all.<\/p><p>Let us remind ourselves what the previous Government and the current Government did to bail out the bankers.  First, they set up NAMA and took all of the bad loans from the balance sheets of the bad banks which had operated disgracefully.  We gave them well over the odds for the properties on which they had lent moneys recklessly.  Therefore, they got away with that.  They got more money and then paid ordinary citizens through the suffering imposed on them.  We then took &euro;60 billion of taxpayers' money and put it into the banks for their so-called &quot;recapitalisation&quot;.  What are we left with?  We are left with 180,000 families in difficulty.  That may not be anything to the Minister of State, but there are 180,000 families in mortgage distress.  What has been done for them?  Absolutely zilch.  The bankers got &euro;60 billion of our money, but the people got nothing in return.<\/p> <p>The Government then turned &euro;30 billion of taxpayer's money, in the form of a promissory note, into sovereign bonds and again placed it on the shoulders of the people of the State.  Further dodgy banking debt - &euro;30 billion - was put on the shoulders of the taxpayer.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State went on to say the Irish nation had suffered the shame and indignity of having to be bailed out.  The people were not bailed out by anybody.  We had to borrow money from the troika; there was no free money given to us.  The troika charged us interest on the money it lent to us; therefore, there was no free ticket for the people and we were not bailed out.  The only people who were bailed out were the bankers, the speculators and the bondholders who got back every single cent they had invested.  It is the people, as the Minister of State rightly said, who have suffered.  While it is welcome that we are going to have a banking inquiry, let us at least face up to responsibility for what happened; let the Government face up to its responsibility.  It, too, failed the people.  It also put money into the banks, extended the bank guarantee and took taxpayer's money, borrowed money, as well as money that had been put away in the National Pensions Reserve Fund for a rainy day, and put it into the banks.  The Minister of State might be dismissive and choose to sit with a bored expression on his face because he does not like hearing the truth, but that is the reality.  The reality is that the suffering which he accepts has happened is having an unbearable impact on many families in the State.  While it is welcome that the banking inquiry will examine the details of what happened, we recognise that it will not undo the damage done by this and the previous Government.  All of the pain taken will not be undone by it.  All of the money the Government put into the banks will not be undone through it.  None of this will be undone.  That will only happen if we get a deal at European Union level to retrospectively recapitalise the banks and let taxpayers get the money back and be relieved of the debt on their shoulders which should never have been put on them in the first place.  The Minister of State has a brass neck in coming here to proclaim this as a triumph, something we should all celebrate and that will be meaningful to the people.  At the end of the day, the only thing that will mean anything to them is if they get the money back that they put into the banks in the first place.  Undoing the damage that the Minister of State's party, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il did to the State is what we really need.  We need a banking deal.

The game is by not over by a long shot, but what we are here to discuss is the establishment of the banking inquiry which will examine how the country got into such an awful mess.  Its aim is to find out how the political, regulatory and banking systems broke down to such an extent that the country was left on its knees.  Lives have been destroyed; homes have been repossessed; businesses have been lost, and the people are entitled to know how the system imploded to such an extent.  <\/p><p>Senator John Crown hit the nail on the head when he spoke about bank managers and officials being paid to sell money to people who were not in a position to repay it.  That is a significant element of the difficulties encountered.  Those of us who are older remember dealing with bank managers many years ago to negotiate a mortgage on a house.  We knew that if we did not have 20% of the price of the house as a deposit, we would not get a mortgage.  We also knew that we would not be able to borrow more than 2.5 times our household income.  We criticised bank managers in those days for being too tough, but that was how the banking system should have been run.  That is not what happened and we need to get all of the details of what went wrong on the fateful night the bank guarantee was given and in the period leading up to it.  I have no doubt the Members of the Oireachtas who will sit on the committee of inquiry will do a fine job in an impartial and non-partisan manner.  That is what they were elected to do.  They were elected to serve the people and get answers for them.<\/p><p>We would have liked the inquiry to have been established much sooner, but the people, in their wisdom, decided not to give Oireachtas Members the authority to do so when the question was put to them in a referendum.   We are now heading towards a situation where we will get answers.  I hope we will also put in place structures for the future to ensure the debacle we have seen in the past seven or eight years will not be repeated and that the people will never again have to go through the hardship they are now experiencing.  It is encouraging that, at last, after two and a half years of tough decisions but good and honest governance, we are beginning to see the economy turn around.  Over 60,000 jobs have been created in the past year, or rather the Government has created the climate to allow these jobs to be created.  We are beginning to see confidence return.  <\/p><p>I know that the Minister of State will take back the message from the Seanad that we all want to see the Minister for Finance achieve a deal on some of the legacy debt which would ease the pressure further.  We must acknowledge the significant reductions in debt levels already achieved by the Government in its two and half years in office.  The deal on the promissory notes and other aspects of our lending must also be acknowledged.  <\/p><p>In commending the motion to the House I have no doubt that the Members we will entrust with responsibility for conducting the inquiry will serve the people well and will deliver their report in a timely fashion.  We do not want to see an inquiry dragging on for too long and wish the participants well.  The Members who have been selected from the D&aacute;il are all extremely competent, conscientious and hardworking and I have every confidence that the two Members who will be selected from this House will also make a fine contribution to the long-overdue and badly needed banking inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400034#KK00900","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1400081100,"counter":363,"content":"<p>N&iacute; raibh s&eacute; i gceist agam labhairt ar an r&uacute;n seo, ach bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-deacair fanacht i m&oacute; shu&iacute; agus m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an raim&eacute;is at&aacute; ar bun ag daoine &oacute;n Rialtas.

I served with him on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, which was a pleasure.  I congratulate him on his elevation to higher office and wish him well in it.  He has a very important brief and I am very grateful that he has been able to come to the House so soon after taking up his post to discuss an issue which relates to the crossover from the HSE to Tusla, or the Child and Family Agency as it might be known, and the different services being transferred.  I am raising the case of Ballinasloe Therapeutic Learning Centre which delivers a number of programmes for children and families in the Ballinasloe area.  Its aims are to encourage the early referral of children; provide practical support, training and advice for parents; provide an assessment facility for children; and carry out appropriate intervention programmes.  It looks to develop children's life skills.<\/p><p>I understand that under section 10 which deals with the provision of funding by the HSE, the centre received &euro;19,000 to deliver two particular programmes.  One dealt with group speech and language therapy sessions, while the other delivered individual sessions for the children involved.  My understanding is that, with the setting up of Tusla, half of this funding or more is being cut.  The centre is being told that it can no longer continue the group speech and language therapy sessions.  This will seriously hinder the delivery of its programmes.  I understand it has made inquiries with the HSE locally through the primary, community and continuing care service and been told no funding will be available to it to cover the shortfall.  I also understand staff in Tusla are quite shocked by this and the allocation the centre has been given.<\/p><p>There is a sense that the setting up of Tusla involves not only a reorganisation of the facilities and services but is also a cover for cutbacks to be made, of which this might be a manifestation.  I hope this is not the case and that the Minister is here to tell us this has been an aberration in the change from one system to another; that this essential and very necessary service for children in the Ballinasloe area and their families can be maintained; and that heads can be banged together in respect of the funding of &euro;10,000 which has been taken away.  The HSE states it is not its problem, while Tusla states it does not have the money.  I hope the Minister can take this on issue in his new role and resolve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400036#MM00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1400082300,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh for sharing his time and welcome the Minister.  <\/p><p>I visited Ballinasloe Therapeutic Learning Centre last Friday when I saw for myself the fantastic work being done in it.  The organisation was established in 1983 and has been funded by the HSE but will now be funded by Tusla.  It is a partnership project between Ballinasloe Social Services, a voluntary organisation, and the HSE.  It provides a model of service for children which ensures difficulties identified at an early age can be managed.<\/p><p>There are two elements to what the child care manager at the centre is doing.  She works for eight hours with the HSE speech and language therapy service in providing programmes in its dedicated child care facility for small groups of children who require extra intervention owing to a delay in development and disorders.  She works for eight hours per week in individual interventions on a sessional basis for children and their parents referred by the HSE, family support workers, public health nurses, early intervention teams, hospital paediatricians and child and adolescent mental health services.  Some 63 children are receiving a service at the centre. <\/p><p>I have received a formal submission from the centre.  I know that the Minister has had very little time to look at this situation, but I hope that for the want of &euro;9,500, we will be able to ensure that from September this service can continue, given the volumes of children who benefit from it, the fact that difficulties are being identified at an early stage and that the service is helping parents to come to terms with the difficulties experienced by their children.  The centre is providing an invaluable service.  I extend an invitation to the Minister to spend a few minutes in the facility in the near future to see what is being done in it.  The lady who runs it is amazing and the facilities provided are fantastic.  I cannot say enough in support of the centre and very much appreciate Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh's sharing of time with me to support this cause.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400036#MM00700","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1400082300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his kind words.  <\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Senators Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Michael Mullins.  I acknowledge the important work done by Ballinasloe Therapeutic and Learning Centre in providing a multidisciplinary service for children and families in the local community of east Galway.  The centre has been in operation since 1983 and the services provided are designed to ensure the developmental needs of children can be supported and addressed at an early stage.<\/p><p>The issue raised by the Senators relates to the level of funding provided for the centre by the Child and Family Agency.  The agency has advised that the level of funding provided for the centre has been reduced by &euro;19,000.  The agency provides funding for family support and speech and language therapy services.  The reduction in funding, in the order of 2.5%, is required to introduce further efficiencies within the service and as a consequence of the development by the newly established agency of early intervention teams and the redeployment of staff.  This has reduced somewhat the requirement to source services externally.  I am assured by the agency that no child has been disadvantaged as a result of the realignment of services.<\/p><p>The continuing significant level of support from the agency is being provided at a time when all service providers are faced with particular challenges arising from the need to restore order to the public finances.  In addition to the funding provided by the Child and Family Agency, my Department provides funding under the community child care subvention programme which is administered by Pobal and through the early childhood care and education programme.  Funding under the community child care subvention programme for the centre for the period from September 2013 to September 2014 will exceed &euro;16,000, while funding provided under the early childhood care and education programme amounts to &euro;44,000 in the period from September 2013 to May 2014.<\/p><p>The Government is making a very significant investment, totalling more than &euro;260 million, in child care programmes nationally.  This means that close to 68,000 children benefit annually from child care places as a consequence of this expenditure.  Despite the challenging budgetary position, we have succeeded in maintaining the preschool year as a universal and free programme, ensuring a significant number of children can avail of quality preschool services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.  <\/p><p>The Senators will appreciate that all service providers in receipt of State funding have had to generate efficiencies in service delivery.  While I appreciate the challenges involved and those outlined by the Senators, we need to ensure all resources available to support the provision of early years services are fully maximised.  The approach of the Child and Family Agency as outlined is consistent with this objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400036#MM00800","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1400082300,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I cannot agree with the line in Minister's response \"I am assured by the agency that no child has been disadvantaged as a result of the realignment of services\" because I am being told this is not the truth.

Our interactions are almost a daily occurrence at this stage.  I recently received representations from the staff at Drogheda Community Training Centre, following a letter they received on Friday regarding the withdrawal of funds by SOLAS from May 2015.  This news came as a shock to the staff in the training centre.  Unfortunately, they were given no reason as to why funding will be withdrawn next year.  The chairperson of Drogheda Community Training Centre received a letter on 8 May which reads as follows:<blockquote><br \/>In accordance with clause 25.1 of the agreement, we hereby notify you of our intention to terminate the agreement.  This clause provides that any such notice must be given not less than 12 months in advance of such termination.  Accordingly, unless terminated earlier, pursuant to clause 25.2, the agreement shall terminate on 8 May 2015.  <\/blockquote>No reason was given for the termination of the agreement.  The community training centre, in partnership with SOLAS, provides important training for early school leavers and has a strong presence in the local community.  The training centre provides an avenue for young people to achieve personal and work-related skills.  The foundation this training centre provides has enabled countless numbers of young people to achieve goals that might otherwise not have been possible.  Having spoken with staff from Drogheda Community Training Centre I can attest to the passion and commitment they have for their work.  They are devastated by this news.  The Drogheda Community Training Centre has provided an excellent service for 30 years and I sincerely hope we can find some way to ensure that this continues.<br \/>The Minister of State is well aware of the importance of these centres and the links they provide within the training process.  I ask him to address this situation immediately as this will have a very negative impact on the local community and particularly on early school leavers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400037#NN00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1400082900,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moran for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  As everyone is aware, significant reforms are ongoing at every level of the Irish education system, particularly in the further education and training area and in higher education.  We are slowly but surely moving towards a closer alignment to the labour market based on evidence from all relevant stakeholders, including employers, learners, the unemployed and international best practice.  Just two days ago the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and I launched Ireland's first ever further education and training strategy which sets out exactly the route for all learners, irrespective of their existing skills set and levels of attainment, to access a very high quality and meaningful further education and training opportunity.  The aims of these reforms can be summarised as follows: to support inclusion and diversity; to improve equality and accountability; and to create opportunities for learners and trainees to go on to the next level of training or into the world of work.<\/p><p>It is my Department's objective and ambition to create a strong, relevant and co-ordinated further education and training sector through structural change which involves a number of reforms.  Central to the reform process has been the creation of SOLAS, our new further education and training authority, which is tasked with a co-ordinating and funding role and the local education and training boards, ETBs, which are tasked with the delivery of further education and training services.  We now have our 33 VECs amalgamated into 16 ETBs, each with the scale and capacity to improve the opportunities offered to those out of work.  By 1 July, all of the former F&Aacute;S training centres will have transferred over to the ETBs and the training that takes place within those centres will be provided under the auspices of the ETBs.<\/p><p>SOLAS was tasked with preparing a five-year strategy which was published this week.  The strategy was devised through an exemplary consultation process, which involved seeking and listening to the views of everyone involved in the sector, from learners to Government and from employers to trade unions.  SOLAS submitted the strategy to the Minister for Education and Skills on 31 March and it was officially launched this week.<\/p><p>SOLAS is tasked with achieving the best possible outcomes for our learners, value for money for the taxpayer and appropriate standards of corporate governance by training providers.  I understand that following a review of learning outcomes and a cost benefit analysis, SOLAS training north east has decided to discontinue funding for Drogheda Community Training Centre from May 2015.  I am informed that current learners will be supported to complete existing programmes and individual learning plans will be agreed and supervised by SOLAS and Drogheda Community Training Centre to ensure continuity of service delivery.  Early school leavers who would normally have been referred to the centre will receive priority referral to access other suitable training programmes in the Drogheda area.  It is the intention that over the next 12 months Louth Meath Education and Training Board, including SOLAS training north east, will engage with all relevant stakeholders with a view to further enhancing provision for early school leavers in the Drogheda area.  SOLAS and I would like to thank the staff and the board of management of Drogheda Community Training Centre for their service and professionalism in dealing with these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014051400037#NN00300","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1400082900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>If I understand the Minister of State correctly, this decision is based on the review of the learning outcomes and a cost benefit analysis.
