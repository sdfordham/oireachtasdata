I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet it.  It is timely to discuss the national strategy as we step up a gear in terms of the implementation of the strategy.<\/p><p>  The HEA is centrally involved in supporting the Minister and the Department in the implementation of the higher education strategy.  We are very much guided by the principles and objectives outlined by the Minister in his recent speech to the higher education sector on Thursday, 22 November.  Those objectives are recognising the importance of higher education in producing the human capital and research outputs that will underpin continued competitiveness and national economic recovery; building on our favourable demographic context &ndash; our large and expanding pool of young people that is one of our biggest strategic assets and one that many OECD countries envy; and recognising that Ireland operates in an international context, and that our higher education system and its institutions must compete and be successful in that international context.  It is not just our institutions but our graduates that must compete.<\/p><p>  My colleagues from the Department for Education and Skills will outline the broad context for reform and the main actions for change we are undertaking in partnership with it.  I hope to complement what the Department will say by focusing on three particular elements of the programme.  The first is building the landscape of higher education.  The second is reforming the funding models, including introducing an element of performance into the funding of higher education, and the third is sustainability.<\/p><p>  The national strategy recommended that the future higher education system should consist of autonomous, well-governed institutions that are strategically led.  It also recommended that the strategy would be informed by a recognition of their particular strengths as institutions within themselves and within a broader higher education system, a recognition of national policy objectives, and a commitment by the institutions, individually and collectively, to meet those objectives according to their strengths and with a high degree of accountability.<\/p><p>  Over the course of 2012, the HEA has led an intensive process of engagement with the higher education institutions aimed at better understanding their particular mission both now and into the future, to set the basis for the future higher education landscape.  We have done this through our request for institutions to submit their vision for their future role in the system, and we have correlated this with extensive data collection on current institutional profiles and performance.  We have also received international advice and assessed the institutional submissions against the stated objectives of the Hunt report - the national strategy for higher education.  We have commissioned the ESRI to advise on the future demand for higher education, both student and employer-led.  We aim to undertake further discussions with the institutions early next year, and to provide final advice to the Minister by March 2013.  Thereafter, it will be a matter for the Minister to decide how best to move forward with the recommendations he receives on the structure of the system.<\/p><p>  The process will also be critical in setting up the further development of our funding model into the future.  In considering that future development, it is appropriate first to recognise the many strengths of the current funding model.  It is widely recognised, within and outside Ireland, to be fair and impartial.  I might also add that it is transparent.  Furthermore, it has been very successful in meeting critical State objectives.  The massive expansion from roughly 36% to approximately 65% participation in the past 20 years has been facilitated by a funding model that has incentivised efficiency and growth.  In addition, institutions have played their part by using the model to manage their operations consistently within budget.  It is noteworthy that despite the very severe funding restrictions of recent years and the significant rise in student numbers, all the HEA-funded institutions have managed within budget and produced quality outcomes in terms of graduates.<\/p><p>  We are conscious the HEA can and must do more in this space.  We are especially conscious that while our funding model is fair and impartial and drives efficiencies, it is relatively weak on assessing strategy and assessing performance against strategy, in particular the latter.<\/p> <p>It is for that reason we proposed, and the national strategy accepted, an increased role for assessment of institutional strategy and for that assessment to feed into institutional funding.  We want to ensure that as institutions shape their strategy, they do so in accordance with the principles I outlined, namely, that they shape their programmes and activities in line with their institutional strengths in the context of their role as part of a system of higher education rather than as stand-alone institutions, and that they take account of and deliver against national objectives in an accountable way.  We have engaged in consultation with the institutions on how to translate this objective into practice, and we have taken international advice.  We expect to commence this process in 2013 and to develop it over succeeding years.  I emphasise that the process I refer to is a process of strategic dialogue and funding by performance by reference to outcomes.<\/p><p> The Higher Education Authority, HEA, is concerned, as is the Minister and his Department, to underpin the future development of Irish higher education on a sustainable basis.  Sustainability has a number of elements.  Within higher education we must take account of the extensive resources invested by the State and ensure best value is delivered.  That is the point of departure.  Considerable achievement is evident in shared procurement but much more needs to be done to improve shared services, and that has major implications in changes to work practices and, potentially, human resources strategies.<\/p><p> We must expand our thinking on the way other forms of institutional collaborations can improve quality, in particular how co-operation between institutions can enhance quality of programmes.  We know there is considerable fragmentation of activity in many discipline areas.  We must balance the important benefits that fragmentation or multiple provision can bring in terms of increased access, especially on a regional basis, against considerations that fragmentation may reduce the quality of the provision.  We know from experience in the HEA that at the research level collaboration can bring great benefits.  We must aim for similar outcomes at undergraduate level, and regional clusters of activity, as proposed in the national strategy, can be very important in this regard.  I stress that we see these not as limited clusters between higher education institutions but also with further education providers and other relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p> More generally, there is an important sustainability strategy issue for Ireland.  I mentioned previously the major strategic asset we possess in the form of a growing young population.  We must remember that investment in their education has produced and continues to produce major returns for the individuals themselves, employers, society and the economy.  That is not simply another cost to be met in an annual budget but part of investing in Ireland&rsquo;s future.  I will use an analogy to illustrate it graphically.  We would be aghast if we read of a company discovering huge offshore oil fields but deciding not to exploit them because of significant upfront costs.  No company would do that because they would see the future benefits that would arise for years after those initial investments.  In that sense our young people are our oil, although there are indications that there have been some discoveries of oil off the south coast.  However, the point is a valid one.  We should consider our young people now entering higher education, and who will enter in increasing numbers for the foreseeable future, not as a cost but as our investment in our future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354108200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to attend.  We were asked to come before the committee to brief members on the higher education reform programme embarked upon following the publication of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.  That was published in early 2011 and the key components of that strategy were subsequently endorsed in May 2012 by the current Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, on behalf of the Government.  The implementation of that reform programme falls to the Department and also to the Higher Education Authority in a key leadership role.<\/p><p>  In summary, the strategy outlines the change agenda that will result in a modern, flexible higher education system which is more accessible to a much greater range of people and has a high quality and innovative provision of teaching research as its hallmark.  This will require having smaller numbers of large, high quality, well-governed institutions that are funded sustainably, each with a distinct mission to meet a growing diversity of demand and new challenges.  That is the key objective of the reform process.<\/p><p>  There are a range of recommendations set out in the strategy which I have provided to the members and which I do not propose to go through, but they range from the requirement to ensure diversity and flexibility of provision to meet demands to ensuring the quality and sustainability of the system is assured.  As I said, the strategy is being implemented in close collaboration with our colleagues in the Higher Education Authority and in partnership with higher education institutions and many other stakeholders in this complex landscape.<\/p><p>  I will talk briefly about three key areas, namely, the overarching implementation arrangements, the main challenges to be addressed, and the key priorities for implementation for 2012 and 2013.  Implementation is at the heart of this reform process and to ensure effective oversight of implementation, the Department of Education and Skills has established a high level implementation oversight group chaired by the Secretary General of the Department.  Members of the group are from a diverse range of organisations with lead responsibility for implementation of recommendations.  We have published the implementation plan on which the work of the group is based which shows the recommendations and the associated responsibility for implementation.  We have also published the latest progress report on priority areas and we are glad to make that available to members.  That is our key implementation structure.<\/p><p>  There are many challenges but among the main ones identified by the strategy is the much higher demand for participation by students - internationally and domestically - adult learners and school leavers in the coming decades.  Both the Department and the ESRI have predicted an increase in full-time demand in the region of 16% by 2020, which is a very high number in a short space of time.  A second challenge will be the continued constrained financial environment at a time when demand is rising.  The third challenge we would articulate is the pressing need to mobilise and prioritise resources while enhancing quality in all areas of activity in the higher education sector.  That would include the key pillars of research, teaching and learning, and engagement.<\/p><p>  Progress to date has been good, and I will now briefly outline some of the progress that has been made.  Regarding the key element of teaching and learning, last week the Minister launched the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning in higher education which will provide the national forum for the discussion of issues relating to the enhancement of teaching and learning and provide a key leadership role across all the higher education institutions in this crucial area.  To support that work and other work, national student and employer surveys are being developed because it is considered very important to have that feedback built into the development and implementation of policy.  A full-scale national pilot on the student survey will run in the first quarter of next year.<\/p><p>  A second key area on which significant progress has been made is in terms of advancing the agenda in regard to the key transition from second to third level.  That is a major agenda for the Minister and a transition steering group will submit a report on proposals for change, including timeframes for implementation, early in the new year.  We have also established an enterprise engagement forum, again chaired by the Secretary General, to formalise the engagement with enterprise given the importance of that agenda for the Department.<\/p><p>  In that context, in regard to skills and the labour market, there has been strong collaboration among the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority, the expert group on future skills needs and enterprise agencies, among others.  That has led to the implementation of a suite of measures to address identified skills deficits.  Targeted funding has been made available also to provide high quality, flexible higher education opportunities for the unemployed and those seeking jobs in areas where there are identified skills shortages.  Members will be familiar with the Springboard and the ICT skills projects.<\/p><p>  The last area I want to deal with is system development, which is at the core of implementation.  Last week, the Minister for Education and Skills addressed the higher education sector and outlined four priorities for future landscape development and reconfiguration.<\/p> <p>These are: strengthening our university system; the development and consolidation of the IT sector; achieving critical mass through collaboration and consolidation and the formation of regional clusters between universities, stronger institutes of technology and future technological universities; and increased sustainability and capacity in the higher education system, as alluded to by Mr. Boland.<\/p><p> The HEA is developing system-configuration advice for the Minister for spring 2013 and is examining a range of inputs on which to base further engagement with institutions on these issues.  We envisage the HEA will engage with institutions in detail in the new year.  This process will culminate in the HEA's advice to the Minister in the spring.  The reconfiguration of the system is one of the key next steps.<\/p><p> A second key next step concerns legislative change, which is essential to underpin the complex and ambitious programme of reform.  Work has commenced on the preparation of a programme of statutory reform.  There are a number of objectives, the first of which is to provide for the merging and establishment of consolidated institutes of technology as technological universities.   Designation will occur on the meeting of the criteria.  The second component is putting in place legislation to strengthen the powers of the HEA to regulate the higher education system.<\/p><p> Institutional governance structures will also be reformed and legislation has been brought forward to increase the accountability of the institutions and ensure they are in line with Government policy on staffing and numbers.  This legislative change is a major priority for the Department and HEA.<\/p><p> The third key next step relates to the sustainability of the system.  In parallel with the system development process, the HEA, in collaboration with the Department, has engaged in further analysis of institutional and system sustainability issues.<\/p><p> I have given a very broad overview of developments on the higher education reform programme.  We are happy to answer the questions of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354108800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boland and his team from the HEA, and Ms Doyle and her team from the Department.  They are present to discuss the very pressing challenges in the third level sector and those to be faced in the coming years.<\/p><p>  The Hunt report forms the basis of the plan for third level education.  The report outlined that we would require &euro;500 million per year for ten years to meet the challenges faced in expanding the education system and student numbers.  There are significant funding pressures in third level sector.  The Hunt report expected student numbers would increase from 160,000 to 250,000 by 2030.  Does this projection still stand?  The Hunt report is now at least two years old and it took 18 months to compile, which means it dates from late 2008.  Are we still working from the report's projections and assumptions on student numbers and the funding required to ensure our education system is fit for purpose?<\/p><p>  Following the Hunt report's publication, a report was commissioned by the HEA and compiled by a panel of international experts.  Did the HEA decide to commission it and was the Minister involved?  What is the current standing of that report?  When it was published, the Minister pooh-poohed it and said it was not in line with policy.  Does the report form part of the HEA's current work on planning?<\/p><p>  The Minister's comments of last week, which constituted a repetition of comments he made on a number of other occasions, suggest he wants the third level institutions to put their heads together to determine what kinds of efficiencies can be achieved and the additional value that can be obtained using the current spending pot.  What value might we be able to obtain from current expenditure?  Has the Department or HEA an estimate of what can be gained from improved efficiencies and better structuring?  While the delegates cannot give specifics, they should surely have an expectation as to what can be obtained, such that we will know where we stand.  Knowing this will help inform our understanding of the challenges that arise in obtaining additional required funding.<\/p><p>  How much additional funding will be required?  I referred to the &euro;500 million mentioned in the Hunt report.  How can the funding issue be addressed?  An increase in the student registration fee was announced.  Students will have to come up with the cash in the next two to three years.  The pressure this causes has been well documented.  It causes access issues for particular categories of students.<\/p><p>  Although technological universities are being considered, I am particularly concerned about the status of the remaining institutes of technology.  We should not allow the creation of  a third category of education provision in the higher education sector.  Institutes of technology are crucial to the economic development of an area and to attracting industry.  The quality of education in the institutes of technology needs to be maintained.  What is the status of colleges outside the technological university sector?  We must ensure another educational tier is not created.<\/p><p>  There is a recruitment ban across the public service.  Where will gaps emerge over the next five years, and certainly the next three years, on foot of staff retirements?  What difficulties may be created in institutions in regard to maintaining the quality of education in various faculties?  What is the plan to address this?  Our standing in this regard influences our international ranking.  Equally, it informs the quality of courses being provided.  We need to ensure the public service recruitment ban is not leading directly to a dilution of the product we are offering to students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800005#E00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1354108800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending.  I apologise on behalf of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  He asked me to deputise for him today as he has to attend another meeting.<\/p><p>  We certainly agree with any strategy that aims to have a more modern and flexible education system.  It is good that the relevant studies have been carried out and that the Government is examining ways to improve education.  With regard to the economic and resource-utilisation aspects, approximately 80% of the higher education budget is spent on pay.<\/p> <p>I note the pay of university professors in Ireland is much higher in comparison with the rates in Canada or the United States.  When one considers the majority of the best universities in the world are in America, it is clear that attainment of high standards in education - or indeed in banking or politics - is not intrinsically linked to high wages.  Consequently, I believe the entire subject of high pay within education must be examined.  Perhaps there is scope for increasing funding streams for Irish universities because globally, there are several examples in which the alumni of various colleges contribute hugely to their budgets.  For instance, there are several examples from the United States in which the alumni provide a fair percentage of the universities' income stream.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in would promote the development of online courses and supports open education, which is extensively used throughout the world.  A number of such models operate throughout the world, including in Australia.  I am surprised one key point was not mentioned today, which is that on foot of reduced parental income and reduced grants for students attending college, one risks going back to the days when only the very wealthy could afford quality third level education.  Perhaps one way to address this risk would be to focus on online courses.  While I acknowledge it would cost money, were it to provide better education to a wider audience of students, it would be a very good investment.  One of the reports suggested that education should be seen not as a cost but as an investment and I fully subscribe to that view.  Has consideration been given to extending the academic year?  While I am unsure what is the position globally in this regard, it appears to me as though it should be possible to reduce a four-year course to three years by extending the academic year.  I confess there may be good reasons this should not be done but I am not aware of them.  If productivity is being examined, the most obvious sign of productivity would be the production of more graduates in a shorter time and overall, the production of more graduates with the requisite skills to work in the present environment.<\/p><p> I refer to the Hunt report and hope I will not be accused of being parochial in this regard.  It appears that centralisation automatically is assumed to be a good thing and that it will benefit quality, efficiency and effectiveness.  In many cases that is so, but not always.  I am thinking of St. Angela's College, Sligo, about which the recommendation was the service should relocate from that college to NUI Galway.  First, were that service to leave St. Angela's, it would put in jeopardy the other services offered in that college.  Second, it should not be automatically assumed that the service would be improved by relocation.  There is tremendous scope for improved co-operation and joint governance without physically transferring and endangering what is an excellent college in Sligo.  Consequently, I hope the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department have not closed their minds to the possibility of achieving or perhaps exceeding the same desirable objectives, while leaving the service within St. Angela's College.  I seek the witnesses' views on this issue.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the ICT skills project and I note concerns have been expressed in some IT colleges-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800005#E00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354109400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to wrap up with this question because we have other members who wish to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800006#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1354109400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I have only one further question to ask after this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800006#F00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1354109400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800006#F00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1354109400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>There is concern in some colleges that funding has not been made available for next year and subsequent years.

On the important point of demographic projections, there has been a revision of the projections in reference to the figures set out in the Hunt report.  Work subsequently was completed with the Department in collaboration with the ESRI and the recently-published ESRI report sets out the revised projections.  While the increases are on a smaller scale than those set out in the Hunt report, they still are highly significant.  We face a highly significant increase of more than 12% by 2015 or 2016 and of 20% by 2020.  Consequently, the scale of the task remains very large.  Moreover, as Deputy McConalogue asked in his next question, the question regarding the solutions to the funding of the present system and the estimated additional demand is key to this issue.  The Deputy also asked about costings and savings expected and this clearly is an area on which we have been focusing strongly for some time.  Most observers would agree there undoubtedly are costings and savings to be got from looking in detail at the existing system and to making sure that all fragmentation of courses and duplication are eliminated.  The HEA and the Department are about to enter a formal process to examine where the expenditure that already is in the system lies and to try to think through, in a strategic way, what are the best solutions for the higher education institutions and for the service they provide.<\/p><p>  Part of the system of reconfiguration leads me into a third point made by Deputy pertaining to the future of the institutes of technology, IT, sector.  As members are aware, there are two main elements to the higher education sector at present and a real focus and a real contribution is made from the IT sector.  In his speech last week, the Minister set out a programme of change for the sector in which he indicated that he envisaged in the first instance that stronger, larger, regionally-based institutions would be the first port of call for the sector and he encouraged the leaders of the institutions to think about what needs to be done to achieve this.  The strength of the IT sector in meeting the needs of the local economy, local businesses and local people is immense and must be enhanced, developed and valued in that process.  Moreover, the focus on the development of the regional clusters will allow this to happen in a structured way.  I believe the Deputy rightly stated this is a sector that must be valued and the contribution of which to the economy and local society is enormous and that this must be safeguarded within the process.  The process for designating ITs that make application for technical university status already has been set out and will be implemented in accordance with the strict criteria.<\/p> <p> The numbers involved within the higher education section were mentioned.  In recent years there has been a significant reduction in staff numbers, while an increased number of students has been catered for.  This has been one of the big successes in the sector.  There is flexibility for individual institutions to fill posts they require to have filled while staying within the ECF ceiling on numbers and also to retrain those whose skills are no longer required. <\/p><p> Deputy Michael Colreavy raised a number of points.  Public service pay is an issue that is being addressed centrally.  I understand there is a meeting this afternoon to discuss these issues and that the education sector is part of that process.  Discussions on productivity in a number of areas will be held in the coming period.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned the need to take on board the potential of technology to achieve quicker and better education outcomes.  We have been thinking about this issue, about which Mr. Boland will say a little more.  We agree on the need to use technology and have some interesting examples from around the world.  It is important to provide a better education experience and greater access.  It needs to be subsumed into the overall process of change in a structured and dynamic way.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about the ICT skills project.  There is a new call for proposals to start early in 2013.  My colleague, Ms Forde, can outline the position in more detail, if the committee so wishes.<\/p><p> The designation of the technical universities is an important issue.

We now have firm figures for and evidence of the likely demand for higher education places, both from students and also, importantly, employers.  There is a clear message coming from the ESRI report which was compiled at the behest of the HEA, that we need every graduate we can get hold of to ensure future demographic growth.<\/p><p>  Sometimes, when people talk about sustainability, the default position - it has been my own in the past - is: how do we get more money into the system?  This morning I was looking at a website on which it was indicated that Pearsons, an international consultancy group, had published an assessment of the best education systems in the world.  Ireland ranks very well in 11th place.  The assessment report states:<blockquote>Throwing money at education by itself rarely produces results.  The individual changes to education systems, however sensible, rarely do much on their own.  Education requires long-term, coherent and focused system-wide attention to achieve improvement.<\/blockquote>That is what the national strategy is about.  The strategy and the restructuring of the higher education sector are intimately connected with the sustainability of the sector.  There is a temptation for agencies, even the HEA, to make a crude calculation - for example, X number of extra students by Y amount per student equals so many hundred million euro - but it does not really work.  As Ms Doyle said, we will be working with the Department in the coming months to try to develop a more sophisticated strategy to ensure the sustainability of the higher education sector.  It will deal with issues such as alumni and the use of technology in the sector.  Sligo Institute of Technology has been strong in this area.<\/p><p>  Underpinning all of this, we need a number of ways by which to reimagine how a higher education is to be provided.  The current model, not just in Ireland but also internationally, is increasingly becoming unsustainable.  The length of the academic year was mentioned, but it is not just that issue; there is also the way in which the academic programme is structured.  There is a big range of issues, long before we come to the question of how much extra the system needs.  <\/p><p>  The international experts' report was mentioned.  I will try to put the issue in context.  Creating a coherent system of higher education institutions, interlocking in a co-ordinated way, has never been tried in Ireland and only rarely been tried successfully internationally.  In doing this work, therefore, the HEA wanted to receive the best possible advice from as many quarters as possible.  We adopted a position of working from bottom-up and top-down in seeking inputs into the process.  In the bottom-up approach institutions were asked, with reference to the Hunt report, where they saw their future.  In the top-down approach the aim was to engage with some international experts, using the strategy as set out in the Hunt report, and ask how we might reconfigure the sector in the optimal way to create a co-ordinated system.  That is exactly what the international panel has done and the input its report will have into the process.  <\/p><p>  It is a mischaracterisation of the Minister's position to say he pooh-poohed the report.  In fairness, last Thursday he endorsed much of its contents.  He said mergers of universities were not a policy objective; they have been tried in the past and did not work.  From a national policy point of view, that issue is not on the agenda.  That is a perfectly reasonable position for the Minister to take.  In so far as it deals with specific configurations, the report covers relatively few pages.  It also deals with aspects that will be of enormous benefit to us in developing a co-ordinated system.  It talks about configuration parameters, general principles and examines international trends in the creation of higher education systems.  It also looks at the qualities a co-ordinated higher education system should have.  All of this is extremely valuable background material for us in our discussions with the institutions and for the institutions in seeing where they are placed on the landscape. <\/p><p>  While specific institutional proposals made by the panel, as being illustrative of an optimal system, are not being considered, 75% of the report is germane to our activities.<\/p> <p>Deputy Colreavy pointed out centralisation is not always a good development.  He is correct and, in discussions about higher level education, it is often said scale is always better.  It is not always better.  I accept St. Angela's College is a fine college.  The Minister's intention through the teacher education review was to improve the quality of the teacher education system.  It set out to see how we can create the best possible teachers.  Internationally, it is agreed stand-alone teacher education facilities are not a good idea.  Instead, teachers need to be educated in a broad and rich research-informed environment.  In an Irish context, that would be in the universities.  Accordingly, the inevitable conclusion for an institution such as St. Angela's is that its teacher-education provision should be relocated to Galway university.  While I am in no position to make any commitments today, we will meet with St. Angela's, as we will with all of the institutions in question, and listen to their issues and if they can point to a better way of doing things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354110600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegations to the committee and thank them for their presentations.

There is significant potential in that third level teaching buildings are empty for up to half of the year and we could be running two terms within a year.  Is there an actual figure on the efficiencies that could be achieved through consolidation and collaboration of universities?<\/p><p>  I agree with the points already made on the potential of online education.  It is important there are proper contact hours with students along with tutorials, however.  There is as much interaction in taking a lecture on a computer screen in one's living room as there is in a lecture hall, particularly in large group lectures such as in arts but the engagement part of the learning process provided by tutorials is still necessary.  Some institutions have done good work in this area and some are miles ahead in it.  Dublin City University, DCU, has been a pioneer in this area for a long time.  However, it is very disparate across the sector.  Does the HEA have an overall strategy for online learning?  It has significant potential and instead of leaving it to individual institutions much more work must be done realising this potential.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in rightly pointed out that league tables do not capture issues such as Access and the effort put into such programmes by third level institutions.  They also do not capture the quality of teaching or learning as these tables are very much skewed by research and publications figures.  To what extent is the HEA monitoring teaching quality and the impact the cuts over the past several years have had on it?  Certainly, the indications from the institutions is that the interactive parts of education such as tutorials and lab sessions are being cut back.<\/p><p>  I note from the presentation that the university presidents will come back on recommendations on entry into third level by the end of the year.

Obviously, there are other countries that manage to run a free third-level education system, including Finland and other Scandinavian countries which have similar populations to Ireland's.  How do their costs compare to ours?<\/p><p>  I note that the HEA publishes a report on who goes to college every six years.  There was one due out this year with the latest figures but I understand it will not be published until next year.  There was a story in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> that I did not read properly and I meant to go back and check, but I think it stated that 40% of students from disadvantaged backgrounds - or perhaps it was disadvantaged schools - go on to third level.  If that is true, it is a significant improvement on previous years.  I wonder whether the Department or the HEA has any figures on that.  That relates to the access issue.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the use of buildings raised by Senator Power, some universities in particular do not maximise their use, traditionally closing their colleges at the weekend.  There are also colleges that are open morning, afternoon, evening and at the weekend, with all sorts of flexibility.  Institutes of technology are particularly flexible in their delivery of education.  What pressure is the HEA and the Department putting on colleges to use their buildings more?<\/p><p>  On an issue raised by Deputy Colreavy and others, the idea of rationalising the education system might make sense but local facilities encourage people to attend college.

One key theme emerging from all of the questions is that of increased numbers and reduced funding.  If we take a minute to reflect on what has happened over the past couple of years, we will see there has been a significant reduction in the funding envelope for higher education and a significant increase in numbers attending colleges.  There has been quite an improvement in productivity but the reality is that it will not be enough.  Given the twin pressures of reduced funding and increased demand, more must be done to close the gap.  As Mr. Boland stated, we are putting in place a systemic review of issues relating to sustainability in this area, which will give us a basis on which to move forward.  That, if you like, is a third leg of the reform programme as we have it.  Much work has been done in this area but more needs to be done.  We need to focus in particular on the key question: how do we ensure that the likely funding reduction from the Exchequer, coupled with demand, can be met without compromising quality?  It is a big question.  It is a big issue on which we must make decisions.<\/p><p>  There are a number of measures that can be taken with fairly immediate effect, such as examining duplication of courses and whether courses could be provided more sensibly and more efficiently in particular locations.<\/p><p>  There are important issues with regard to shared services.  It is not a magic bullet but we think there is significant potential within the higher education sector that has not been tapped.  We are looking at areas such as HR, finance and IT to try to do not only more with less but better with less.  There is a strong agenda in that regard.<\/p><p>  Another element of what needs to be brought into play here, which is a theme which has emerged, relates to transparency issues: how much funding is being spent, where is it going and what are we getting for it.  At the heart of the work on sustainability that we are undertaking is to be able to demonstrate to everybody what funding is going into the system and what the performance and output will be, because those are the issues on which we must focus.  Allied to that, there were issues with regard to staff productivity.  In a moment, I will ask Mr. Phillip Crosby, my colleague who works on the industrial relations side, to make a contribution on that.  Before I finish, however, there were a number of other issues on which I wish to comment.<\/p><p>  Another major theme that has emerged from the discussion this afternoon is the question of quality.  That is an issue of concern to everybody in this room.  It is essential.  One of Ireland's achievements has been to protect the quality of the output from higher education.  Mr. Boland might say a word about that.  Obviously, we have our national framework of qualifications and we have the new organisation Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which has a role in that area.  The HEA and QQI have a close relationship on that shared agenda.<\/p><p>  Another theme that emerged strongly from the discussion relates to access.  A number of members asked about the arrangements for access.  This is another big theme within the higher education landscape.  As the committee will be aware, there are a number of dedicated programmes, including higher education access route, HEAR, and disability access route to education, DARE, for special admissions, and there are a number of criteria in place, including attendance at DEIS schools.  That is one string to the bow.  We have a national access plan in which a range of measures is pursued in conjunction with a dedicated office set up in the HEA on improving access to universities and institutes of technology, and there is a vibrant dialogue going on in that context.  There will be a review of the national access plan in 2013, which will be carried out by the HEA.  That will give us more information on which to assess policy.<\/p><p>  There is a premium for access activities built into the HEA funding model.  There are quite a series of pieces in the overall arrangements.  This morning I was looking at the ESRI report which was published recently.  It continues to signal that there are significant problems with access, but they are problems which go into a range of other issues.  There is a need to take that report, think about the issues it raises and see what the implications are for Government and society, and that is what we propose to do.<\/p><p>  My final remarks are on the transition agenda, which, as the Chairman stated, is a complex agenda.  The Secretary General of the Department is chairing a group.<\/p> <p>A broad range of organisations are represented on it, including the State Examinations Commission, the NCCA, the universities association, IOTI, the Department - I am sure I have left somebody out - and their specialist advisers.  This is a complex landscape and we want to make progress with the understanding that action is required from a range of organisations.  We intend to have a report completed for the Minister shortly on an integrated programme of actions that will see a stronger focus on the transition from second to third level.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Phillip Crosby, to comment on industrial relations aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354111800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Further to Ms Doyle's point on savings, recurrent funding for institutes supported through the HEA decreased from &euro;1.318 billion in 2009 to &euro;1.118 billion in 2012, representing savings of &euro;200 million, or 15%.  These savings have emerged from the budgetary situation in which we find ourselves but they are supported by activity on both pay and non-pay aspects of the industrial relations front in the institutions concerned.  In the period covered by the Croke Park agreement, the student-staff ratio in the higher education sector increased by 18%, which represents a significant productivity gain.  A number of measures in the Croke Park agreement and other sectoral agreements in the higher education sector pursuant to the agreement supported these savings.  One such measure was the provision of an additional hour of working time by academic staff in the universities, which has delivered in the order of 100,000 additional hours annually.  Increased flexibility in the deliver of working hours in the institutes of technology in the 2011-12 academic year put an additional 150,000 lecturing hours into the institutes.  This equates to the negotiation and implementation of approximately 250,000 additional lecturing hours between the two sectors under the Croke Park agreement.<\/p><p>  Union co-operation has been required for introducing ongoing change in other areas.  Significant savings have been made on the non-pay side.  Ms Doyle referred to shared services but the main developments up to now have been in shared procurement, with initiatives such as the Shannon consortium involving multiple institutions producing significant savings in energy, laboratory gases and supplies, advertising, purchasing of journals and literature, office equipment and waste management.<\/p><p>  I will be slightly more circumspect in regard to planned savings but we continue to face a difficult budgetary position and significant savings will be sought from the unions across the public sector generally.

One of the major reasons for the success of Ireland's higher education system is the way in which students have relatively easy access to education on a regional basis.  The institutions of technology in particular have played a major role in this regard.  One of the major objectives of the national strategy in the context of creating regional clusters of institutions is to maintain that comprehensive range of provision locally.  There will be always be areas in which consolidation is appropriate.  For example, it is not possible to have a veterinary school in every part of the country.  Apart from these areas, however, a comprehensive range of provisions is important in terms of regional development and, more important, student access.  Transport has improved considerably in recent years but cost issues arise nevertheless.<\/p><p>  I must express my interest in the CAO as a member of its board.  I agree that it is an excellent organisation.  If I was not appearing before this committee I would be attending a meeting of the board of the CAO to discuss a new strategic direction with the objective of leveraging its past success to support the higher education sector in other ways.  The CAO is mindful of the need to take a strategic view of its future.<\/p><p>  Closer collaboration among universities and institutes is a <i>sine qua non<\/i> of the current reform process.  Sometimes the discussions of reform of structures of higher education leave one with the sense that things will be done to the institutes of technology while the universities blithely go their merry way but that is unlikely to happen.  In fairness, there are good examples of collaboration in university research, including in particular the programme for research in third level institutions which is managed by the HEA on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Collaboration can and does work but we need to see it happening on a wider basis than research, such as in undergraduate areas.<\/p><p>  Ms Doyle addressed some of the issues in respect of quality monitoring by the HEA.  We are all wasting our time if we do not achieve quality outcomes from the higher education sector.  Quality is at the top of everybody's agenda.  The HEA has a key concern with quality but it plays an indirect role in quality assurance.<\/p> <p>Quality in the first instance has to be the responsibility of the institutions; otherwise, all it becomes is a box-ticking exercise.  The institutions have to be concerned with the quality of what they are providing for their students.  QQI, which has been established, has had a major role as a national agency in this space and a key success factor for the future system of higher education we are trying to build is the relationship that will be created between the agency and the HEA.  We have to work hand in glove with the agency, particularly because we have the funding instrument that can drive the recommendations QQI can make on quality.  Those two things need to work well and I expect that in our strategic dialogue with the institutions and in making decisions on funding for performance, quality and proven quality, outcomes will be central.<\/p><p> On the specific initiative, as Ms Doyle mentioned, as well as making a broad-ranging policy statement to the higher education sector last Thursday, the Minister also launched the national forum for teaching and learning, which is being managed through the HEA.  It arose out of considerable funding made via the authority through the strategic innovation fund recently to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in the higher education sector.  We are creating a forum in which the wide range of good practice across the sector can be brought together in a single place and strongly influence high-quality outcomes for students in teaching and learning.<\/p><p> Senator Power asked for figures on postgraduates.  It is early and we do not have them yet.  Some may not register until later in the year.

The Chairman mentioned 14% and that is not far off the average for a number of the lower groups.  There are still disparities.  There has been significant progress but this is still a long way below the average for participation as a whole.  We therefore have a national drive to push institutions.

We have not been given specific figures.  Mr. Boland said it was difficult to assess this in the way people can in other sectors but, at the same time, the Hunt report, which was commissioned three or four years ago, identified funding needs.  For a number of years, there has been much deliberation about what would required for the future of third level funding.  If we had asked this question four years ago, we would have been told that the sector was difficult and that the Government had set up the Hunt group to do this work.  However, the Hunt report has been in the system for two years.  It outlined specific figures, yet we still are not even considering ballpark figures for how much will be required through Exchequer and other funding or what savings will be made through the value for money exercise in which third level institutions have been asked to engage.  No matter what part of the public sector we discuss with the budget coming up and the Estimates process in train, a key part of undertaking a job is to identify the target.  It might not be achievable but, at the same time, in undertaking it, I would expect a ballpark figure for what is required or what is feasible.  I ask again for figures on what might be achievable in extracting additional value from third level institutions doing the work better.  Does Mr. Boland have ballpark figures for the additional funding that may be required in future years in the third level sector?  Ms Doyle mentioned increased productivity in the sector as a result of reduced funding of &euro;200 million and more students coming into the sector.  That is happening across all sectors.  If every Department could work its own version of the miracle of the loaves and fishes there would be increased productivity, but perhaps there are fewer loaves and fishes and more people eating.  This would mean more students leaving the system with a poor-quality education.  Productivity does not necessarily mean improved outcomes.<\/p><p>  Am I correct that the Minister would not allow the international report to be published?

We are seeking to analyse the demand for higher education, analyse the current financing, review the resource allocation models, identify where, if any, additional resources are needed and then make some policy proposals to the Minister.  The work is very much in progress.  Those figures can be taken as being indicative but no more than that at this stage.<\/p><p> I appreciate the Deputy's point on the international panel report.  It is not true to say the Minister would not allow it to be published.  To be totally honest, as I must be with the committee, we had intended to publish the report three or four weeks earlier than it was published.  The Department asked us to pause that publication in order to allow for a clear understanding of where national policy was on some of the issues addressed in the report.  A crucial policy issue was that the international panel strongly supported the objective of the Hunt report in terms of the binary system and the need to retain the missions of both sectors of the binary system.  It took the view that another way to do that would be to create what were described as comprehensive regional universities.  Ultimately that is not consistent with the Hunt report and the Minister took the view that it was not national policy and therefore was not going to be pursued.  The issues only arose in that particular context - to do with specific configurations.  There was no sense of the Minister not allowing the publication of the report.  It was a question of getting the process right so that it did not create unnecessary instability in the system, for want of a better word.<\/p><p> I ask Mr. Costello to comment on the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800011#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354113000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>In terms of transparency, the HEA has considerable data.

It is clear that we have been grappling and continue to do so with the issue raised by Deputy McConalogue, namely, how we get the funding and demand in sync.  As we move forward into the reconfiguration, we see that we need to match up and connect what happens in things like configuration, shared services, consolidation and eliminating duplication.  We see there is potential in all of those areas to achieve greater efficiencies and effectiveness in the system.  We are also acutely aware of the difficult public financial situation which will continue for some years.<\/p><p>  There are two main prongs to what we will be doing over the next while.  The first, as we have discussed this afternoon, will be the issues of reconfiguration and how that helps us to revitalise and renew the system.  A systematic review of the financial sustainability of the system must be connected to that in a very structured way.  Part of the work we must do over the next few weeks and months is to put in place systems relating to both those pieces of work and how we join them up.  At this point, it is fair to say that unlike the situation that pertained when the Hunt deliberations were ongoing, we know there is a very finite financial envelope so we must try within that reality to think about the best value we can get from the public expenditure and how we support the institutions in the really important work they do in raising money privately.<\/p><p>  There are a number of other streams, including the research stream which could and undoubtedly will be of significant potential.  The question of international students is another strand.  What we must do in the coming weeks and months is look at all of those opportunities and gather them together in an integrated way which helps us get to a point where the system is sustainable in its new configuration in light of the opportunities that technology and other forms of provision of education open up to us and where we are confident that we can ensure the quality of the education outcomes.  That is the challenge we face.  Over the next while, we will be moving on that agenda substantially.  <\/p><p>  There are a number of important elements to help us to do that.  The first is the performance dialogue that the HEA will enter into with the individual institutions over the next while in respect of their expenditure and the outcomes and role of the HEA in regulating the sector.  The HEA's role will change in this context and this will be another piece of the jigsaw.  Undoubtedly, we must bring more transparency to the system both in terms of managing the academic workload and reporting on academic performance.  When one puts those things together, that is the agenda for the next while.  A question was raised about whether there is a connection to further education and the answer is \"Yes\".  There is a landscape there which provides resources for people post leaving certificate.  A big job of work is ongoing in the further education sector which will take a lot of time to design and put in place but ultimately there will be a closer connection between higher and further education.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, what the Minister and the Department have been trying to do in this process is to bring the maximum amount of clarity to the process, namely, what the objectives for the system are and what the steps in achieving them will be and also to ensure that the process the Government has adopted in the Hunt report is not derailed and that the institutions in particular are clear about the Government's intent in this area and the steps the Government is putting in place to implement this ambitious programme of change.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012112800013#N00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1354113600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>That concludes the meeting.

It is a Vote that is particularly difficult to estimate as the majority of persons covered by the Vote may, once they reach the age of 60 years, exercise an option to retire at any stage before reaching their compulsory retirement age of 65 years.  Eligible persons may opt to retire even earlier than 60 years under the terms of cost neutral early retirement.<\/p><p>  Persons are also, I am glad to say, generally living longer and therefore in on-going receipt of a pension for a longer post retirement period, which we all welcome. <\/p><p>  The 2012 gross Estimate for Vote 12 the subject of the Supplementary Estimate, was just over &euro;500 million.  This was based on existing pensions in payments; figures received from Departments on their projected retirement numbers for 2012 plus contingency and provision for scheme leavers in 2012 as follows: some 18,636 pensions in payment at the end of December 2011; some 1,400 officers estimated to retire in 2012; and 600 pensions leaving the payroll in 2012.  There will be a net estimated increase of 800 on the pension payroll by the end of 2012, or an estimated total of 19,436 pensions in payment at the end of December 2012.<\/p><p>  In terms of the estimated numbers retiring in 2012, we had regard to the level of retirements anticipated to take place prior to 29 February 2012 as persons availed of the final months of the grace period whereby their retirement benefits would be calculated with reference to their salaries at 31 December 2009, that is before the introduction of the pay reductions imposed with effect from 1 January 2010 under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.<\/p><p>  Having regard to the foregoing it is to be noted that the 2012 gross Estimate of just over &euro;500 million for Vote 12 was set at 16% higher than the 2011 outturn of &euro;432 million.  However, despite best efforts in estimation, including the provision of a significant contingency over the numbers provided by Departments in late 2011 as to their estimations of retirements in 2012, it has transpired that the level of retirements in 2012 has significantly exceeded estimation and therefore is now in the region of 20,000 pensions in payment, over 560 in excess of the original 2012 net full end of year estimate of 19,436.  The numbers who retired were greater and as a consequence we need an additional &euro;25 million to add to the subhead for the purposes of payment to the end of 2012.<\/p><p>  The higher than anticipated numbers retiring has an impact on the A1 subhead of the Vote from which pensions are paid but, most important, on the A4 subhead from which most once-off lump sum payments are made.  On 22 November more than &euro;134 million had been expended from subhead A4, where the 2012 Estimate had been &euro;116 million.  The reason we are seeking this Supplementary Estimate is because of the greater than expected amount under subhead A4, which is the lump sum subhead in the Vote.<\/p><p>  In this context the estimated allocation of just over &euro;500 million gross, published in the Revised Estimates for Public Service 2012 and voted by the House on 21 June 2012, will be exceeded when the December payments of entitlements to retired civil servants and dependants are made to the end of the year.  It is estimated that gross expenditure for 2012 may be in the region of &euro;522 million, that is comprised of the &euro;85 million we have expended to date in addition to &euro;32 million for the provision for the remaining two pay period in 2012 and another &euro;5 million which is the anticipated additional lump sum payments.<\/p><p>  It is however considered prudent to provide for a sum in excess of &euro;22 million in the event that Departments have underestimated the level of lump sum payments payable before the end of December.  In this context, to ensure that the required funding is voted before the excess costs associated with the additional retirements accrue to the Vote, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;25 million is being sought.<\/p><p>  I appreciate that members may ask why the Supplementary Estimate is taking place this late in the year when it would have been known for a number of months that the assumption on which the original Estimate for 2012 had been predicated upon were no longer valid.  Seeking a Supplementary Estimate too early in the year, for example in September or October, runs the risk of either under or over-estimating the additional sum required due to the nature of the Vote.  It is not a case of seeking a Supplementary Estimate to provide funding to bridge the gap between an actual net increase at a particular point in time during the year over the original full year estimated increase as such a snapshot net increase will fluctuate, either up or down, over the remainder of the year due to a combination of the level of further retirements and the number of deaths.<br \/><b><\/b>As an example of the volatility of the Vote, it is to be noted that some 300 new pensions, some of which would be reduced spouses' and children's benefits arising from the death of the pension scheme member, have been put into payment since August.  When a former civil servant passes away, his or her spouse is entitled to half of his or her pension, that is effectively a new pension for the purposes of the Vote and that of course is taken care of as well.<\/p><p>  As expenditure on this Vote is particularly influenced by the numbers of persons who exercise an option to retire before reaching compulsory retirement age, it would have been difficult to estimate the numbers who might choose to exercise such an option over say a four-month period between September and December of this year.  It is therefore only towards the end of the year that a more accurate assessment may be made and an appropriate level of additional funding sought.  Even at this late stage, absolute accuracy is not possible as, for example, persons may only now be actively considering whether to retire before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>It also must be recognised that while additional funding is being requested for the Vote in 2012, the fact that more people than anticipated have opted to retire this year will have a positive impact on the drive to reduce numbers.  I acknowledge that one-off costs are involved when people retire, particularly relating to the payment of lump sums in the year of retirement, but it is clear that when more people retire, the Government makes savings in its pay bill.  When the pension lump sum has been paid in the year of retirement, the continuing pension cost is at most 50% of the original pay cost, and even less if the person in question has less than 40 years' reckonable service.  It is also to be noted that people retiring after 29 January next - this is referred to as the grace period - will receive pensions based on their current pay level; that is, the reduced level.<\/p><p> I will be happy to answer any questions that members of the committee might have.  I appreciate the opportunity the committee has given me in bringing this Supplementary Estimate before it today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800003#B00400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354111800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.

To answer the Chairman's question directly, the additional retirements will be factored into these figures.  A greater than expected number of people have retired this year.

I thank him for attending in the absence of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  I will make a few points and ask a few questions.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State said, there are approximately 290,000 people in the public service.  I do not know how many public service pensioners there are.  Approximately 10% of our 290,000 public servants are civil servants.  The round figure is 30,000 or thereabouts.  We are dealing with a Supplementary Estimate that relates to the pensions of retired civil servants.  As I have said, civil servants account for approximately 10% of public service numbers.  Can the Minister of State explain what is being done for the 90% of public servants who do not have the facility whereby a Minister or Minister of State can come in and seek an additional Supplementary Estimate to cover their pensions?  If a local authority is finding it difficult to make additional pension payments in the last six weeks of the year, having already made payments to staff who left earlier in the year, it cannot ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for an extra &euro;300,000 to cover these costs.  It has to suck it up.  It has to find the money somewhere.<\/p><p>  Most people who retire from the public service are employees of the HSE.  The Department of Health is the only Department that has yet to give us the details of the Supplementary Estimate it requires.  At this late stage, with less than a week to go until the budget for next year, the dysfunctional Minister in question cannot even give us a figure for the Supplementary Estimate for this year.  I do not know whether that Supplementary Estimate will make provision for pensions to be paid to staff who retired during the course of the year.  It might not.  I do not know.  Some 10% of public servants have direct access to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform through the Civil Service.  As long as the D&aacute;il has a vote on a special motion, they are able to have their pensions dealt with.  That does not apply to the other 90% of public servants.  I want to know what kind of equality will apply.  What will happen to pensions in local authorities, State agencies and semi-State agencies?<\/p><p>  I would have preferred to address my second point to the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is a spanking new Department.  As it was established some time in 2011, this year has been its first full year in existence.  Given that it has been lecturing every other Department on the need to come in on budget, this has been one of its first big tests.  The Minister of State has given us some excuses to explain why its figures in relation to this issue were wrong.  That is not acceptable in the real world.<\/p><p>  I ask him to explain subhead A4 to us again.  According to the briefing notes, some &euro;116 million was provided under that subhead in the original Estimate for this year, but we have now been told that the anticipated spend is &euro;139 million.  The difference is &euro;23 million, or approximately 20%.  The Minister of State mentioned in his opening statement that factors like the number of people expected to retire, the current staffing levels and the need to make provision for people leaving were considered when the original Estimate was drawn up.  The Department's figure was 20% wrong.  The original Estimate under subhead A4 was &euro;116 million and the anticipated spend under that subhead is &euro;139 million.  The Department miscalculated by 20%.  I wonder whether it would have got its sums wrong to this extent if this issue was still being dealt with under the Department of Finance.  This is a serious criticism of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We will subject the Department to critical analysis.  We have not had a Supplementary Estimate like this in the area of superannuation and retired allowances for a number of years.  I suspect that in the old days, the Department of Finance would have projected its figures more accurately earlier in the year.  I want the Minister of State to deal with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800004#C00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1354111800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Can I deal with those two issues first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800004#C00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354111800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Okay.

Any public servant who is over the age of 60 can retire at any stage in the year by informing the relevant Department of his or her intentions.  That cost is borne by the Department in question.  We recoup those moneys to the various Departments through this Vote.  It is not a question of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform getting anything wrong.  It is a demand-led situation.

One can separate out this request for additional moneys from the broader issue of public service pensions in their totality.  It is important to say that the vast majority of public sector workers have pensions of &euro;30,000 or less but there is an issue around those who are in receipt of excessive pension payments.  The Minister of State read out the figures I got in reply to a parliamentary question last summer.  It is fair to say there are only a limited number of people who are in receipt of pensions in excess of &euro;100,000.  Will the Minister of State tell the committee what is the top of the range pension that is being paid out to the 84 pensioners?  We had suggested a system using the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts and the levies on pensions over and above &euro;60,000.  We set them out in a legislative form.  Our proposal remains on the table.  If the Minister of State was to use that mechanism a saving of &euro;10 million could be made.

I want to be honest, we will look at any and every proposal that is made.  As the Deputy rightly said the great majority of public service pensioners are on very modest pensions.  She asked the number on pensions of &euro;10,000 or less.  I understand the number is about 7,000 who have a very modest pension.  We are all conscious of large pensions and exits upon which people leave the public sector.  That is why the Government has taken the decision to increase the amount of rebate for people over &euro;100,000, added to the amount of additional taxation and the levies that have been imposed and the reductions in pay at the top within the public sector.  I have made the point to Deputy McDonald previously that this is something for which people internationally have regard.  On the issue of pay and pensions, there is no point in separating them as they amount to the same amount of money coming from the revenue stream.  Three years ago, the totality of public sector pay and pensions was about &euro;20 billion.  Now, if one adds up public sector pay and pensions - pensions have increased but pay has come done because of all the measures that have been introduced - they amount to &euro;17.5 billion.

As the Deputy's point relates to those in receipt of pensions over of &euro;100,000, I make the point that the greatest reduction in terms of people's pay levels has been at the top of the public sector, up to 35% in cases.  If the argument is being put forward by the Deputy that those at the top have not made a contribution, it is not borne out by the statistics which show that those at very top have given a huge amount of their salary, rightly so, because they can afford it.  The Government has not been exclusive in this regard.

Equally, it is misleading for the Deputy or anyone else to posit the view that simply going after people in receipt of pensions of &euro;100,000 or more will make a huge difference in terms of the totality of the saving.  I just make that observation as the Deputy referred to the point as misleading.  What I am happy about is the fact that the Government has introduced a range of measures to make sure that those who have more, in terms of their pension, pay more and have seen real substantial reductions in their pensions.  That is an issue on which the Government has set out its view since coming into government.  I am equally happy with the evidence on a legal basis because pension is a form of deferred remuneration, as the Deputy is aware, in terms of its property right component in terms of the Constitution.  If the Deputy is asking the straight question, have we pushed the potential of doing this in terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, it is the strong view of the Department that if one goes after a cohort of people within the pension cover that we could leave ourselves open for a legal challenge.  The worst circumstance would be if we were to lose in the scenario because the entire legislation framework would fall.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has repeatedly made this point that there has got to be a proportionate view as to the reductions that have been made.  That is why, as the Deputy is well aware, the reductions in pension cover for the entire cohort of salaries have been proportionate and we stand over that.  I am comfortable in stating that someone has a pension of more than &euro;100,000 will not change that situation.  Of course, there are other issues that can be examined, particularly in the taxation area.  That is one half of the equation if we are to introduce greater equality in terms of pension reductions; the other aspect is in terms of taxation.  The Government will consider all these issues in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800006#E00800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354113000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I am not inquiring about the Minister of State's personal comfort or otherwise, my question was more a reference to his political judgment and comfort on these matters.

At the same time, when putting forward proposals, we must try to be as realistic as possible.  I am sure the Minister of State got his advice from the Attorney General, but did Deputy McDonald get legal advice on the imposition of 99% levies on large pensions?  I do not think it would withstand a legal challenge.  Did Sinn F&eacute;in get legal advice to the effect that such a levy would be lawful?  If such advice is available, the Department should review it because during discussions on this matter in recent years the advice has been that imposing levies that are considered to be disproportionate on one group above another would be unconstitutional.  The question of how much can be taken from existing pensions is a difficult one to answer.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fleming criticised the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, in the context of what is happening with his Department's Vote but I remember a meeting with the previous Minister for Health and Children during the last Administration, where he could not tell us how many people were working for the HSE.  He had no idea of the numbers.  Furthermore, memorandums were sent by Ministers in various Departments to the effect that no additional staff should be hired, but people were being taken on left, right and centre.  When the HSE was set up we were expecting to see a rationalisation of top management.  The objective was that there would be fewer people running a more co-ordinated service but what happened was the original top grade in the old health board system, which numbered around 50, exploded and reached 780 at its peak.  That was pure mismanagement on the Government's part.  It should not have allowed such an increase in the number of Grade 8 staff, that is, senior management.  On top of that, we had two rounds of benchmarking, which resulted in excessive pay increases.  All of that has left the current Minister in an extremely difficult situation.  He is trying to control budgets and spending. <\/p><p>  The Minister of State made reference to future pay to pensions ratios, which is something that worries many people.  In the coming years, new entrants to the public service will be paid less but the pensions being paid out will be based on the old pay rates.  That in itself will create an enormous problem for future Governments because public servants will resent the fact that they are being paid less than some pensioners.  It is very important to clarify what has happened on the pensions front, in terms of levies and other charges, as well as the reductions that have happened in recent years.  There is political capital available to the Opposition in terms of arguing that there are many people who are floating around on massive pensions and that the Government is just putting up with that.  There have been enormous reductions made to people's pensions, particularly to the larger ones.  I ask the Minister of State to provide figures to the committee on the pension reductions that have been made for the specific grades referred to by Deputy McDonald.

Deputy Twomey is quite right.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has introduced a new unified pension scheme where career-average earnings rather than 50% of final salary will be used to calculate pensions in future.  Not only will new public servants be on lower pay, they will also be in receipt of significantly lower pensions on retirement, which will have a knock-on effect on the State's liability into the future.  Radical changes have happened in this area since this Government took office and that is borne out by the new single pension scheme.  As the Deputy has also pointed out, there have been significant increases in tax and the USC as well as actual pension reductions, which I will put on the record.  Pensions of between &euro;12,000 and &euro;24,000 have been reduced by 6%, those between &euro;24,000 to &euro;60,000 were reduced by 9%, pensions between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000 were reduced by 12%, while those over &euro;100,000 have been reduced by 20%.  These are radical reductions in pension cover.  Furthermore, at least one third of any pension over &euro;60,000 is returned to the State by way of tax.  When we talk about a pension of &euro;100,000 it is important to remember that &euro;100,000 is not the take-home figure, as many in this room would know.  A lot of change has already occurred and we are not ruling out further changes.  The important numbers are the billions, rather than the tens of millions.

I presume this is an issue that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will be addressing in the context of the discussions that are ongoing with trade union colleagues on this issue.  The net issue is that the Government has given a commitment to get down to numbers of 282,500 by 2015, coming from a height of 320,000 in 2008.  This is the target we must hit.  There is some evidence that a considerable number of people have come out of the system.  At the moment there are 290,000, but how we manage to get the next 8,000 or 9,000 in net reductions will be a critical issue.<\/p><p>  There is some evidence that a group of people who withdrew their applications to depart in February may be incentivised to consider it again if a new scheme is established.  The question is what the cost of that will be and whether we target it at particular sectors where there is a given requirement.  This issue will of necessity come out of the dialogue with the trade unions and on our side with management as a means of trying to ensure that we get to the number of 282,500 by 2015 and do so in a way that does not diminish the number of front-line staff.<\/p><p>  I offer one example of how to transform things and make a difference.  One of the key aspects of public sector reform is shared services.  Next year we will launch a human resources, HR, shared service.  The total number of people involved in HR in central government is 850.  The new HR shared services will do it all with 600 people.  This means we will have more than 250 people to redeploy.  That is a small example of what we can do if we get buy-in for the things we need in shared services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800009#H00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354114800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>We should remember that SUSI is a shared service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800009#H00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1354114800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Yes, and the HSE was a measure of reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800009#H00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1354114800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>\"If you knew Susie like I know Susie\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800009#H00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354114800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is seeking &euro;25 million in respect of retirements that are taking place.

We have a body of law which is quite clear.  I refer to the most recent judgment made by Mr. Justice McMahon.  He referred to this point when he said that if the Exchequer tried to go after a group of people as a means of reducing what was a legitimate expectation on their part in an unfair or disproportionate way, there is a case that can be answered in terms of the courts.  The worst position for the country would be if there was some undermining of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, to which Deputy McDonald referred earlier, because it is emergency legislation.<\/p><p>  Considerable changes have taken place.  The public sector has shrunk in size and its pay and pensions bill has reduced remarkably.  No other country in Europe has done this in the circumstances we have faced.

We should be mindful of that and also of the fact that we need to build capacity within our public service for the future.  This means being flexible in terms of bringing people in.  I understand that among new entrants to the Department of Finance in the past 18 months, some 30% have come from private sector backgrounds.  This is the type of interchange we need to see.

A reformed, efficient and effective public sector is a key part of the Government's programme of recovery, because as an operating pillar the public sector is critical to our economic recovery.<\/p><p>  Before I joined the House, certain Deputies were responsible for introducing the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation.  Lobbying went on from certain sectors of society such as the agricultural community, which sought to be exempted from the CAB legislation.  There was extensive lobbying from certain sectors of society which may have acquired wealth by not conforming to the general provisions of the law.  Representations were made from certain sectors in agriculture to the effect that agriculture should be exempted from CAB work, but this was found to be legally impossible.<\/p> <p>The law cannot be implemented in a way that is not equal to all sections of society.<\/p><p> I return to a matter that concerns process and is not specific to what we are discussing this afternoon.  This afternoon, we are talking about a demand-led scheme the cost of which cannot be predicted because people will come into it at different times.  I am concerned with a matter that arose this year and will continue next year.  Managers of budgets need to practise fiscal discipline which may not have been in the culture of Departments in previous years.  At the ends of years hard cases, particularly in Departments such as health, often come back to select committees looking for extra money.  I have witnessed departmental budgets coming before committees in that regard.  <\/p><p> A certain fiscal discipline and maturity has now come into the Irish economy with the arrival of the IMF and the troika, in that we expose our accounts to examination by others.  That is done on a quarterly basis.  In areas that are not demand-led and where there is more control over expenditure could we consider looking at figures on a quarterly basis to see how those figures are being met, so that when Supplementary Estimates are presented we would have looked at the figures in previous quarters?  Let us suppose, for instance, a saving of &euro;10 per week has to be made over a 52 week period.  If the saving is not made in the first, second and third quarters, a saving of &euro;40 per week has to be made in the last quarter.  Such an approach creates difficulty because the hit a specific Department has to take may have consequences for savings in another area.  <\/p><p> I suggest that the committee look at those figures on a quarterly basis, as part of the Estimates process.  Government and Opposition parties share the responsibility to make such savings.  A saving that is proposed may not be realisable.  It would be better to know that in the first or second quarter so that a different approach can be taken in the second and third quarters.  <\/p><p> If this route is not taken we can end up with one of three difficulties.  First, the saving may not be made because it is not being managed and the issue may be one for the Committee of Public Accounts or it may be necessary to invite managers to attend this sub-committee to explain why the savings are not being made.  Second, if the direction of the saving is not realisable because of an over-estimation the responsibility lies with the Minister and his or her officials.  Third, there may be an overall management issue as to why the savings are not being made.  <\/p><p> I propose this process for next year.  I propose that we look at projections of Estimates on a quarterly basis as much as Estimates adjustment.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800009#H01500","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354115400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>That is a very good suggestion, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22012112800010#J00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354115400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I agree completely with your suggestion, Chairman.

He is clearly much more familiar with it than I am.<\/p><p>  I thank the members of the joint committee for making time available today to discuss this motion.  This is a very busy time for all parties as the budget approaches.  I was a member of the Opposition for a long time so I appreciate the work involved.  As members are aware, the motion concerns an opt-in by Ireland to a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the decisions setting up three funds in the asylum and immigration areas.  These funds are the European Refugee Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals.<\/p><p>  The legal basis for the proposed measure lies in Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Therefore, the proposal is subject to Article 3 of Protocol No. 21 which is annexed to that treaty.  Under this treaty, Ireland has three months from the date on which a proposal has been published in all official EU languages to notify the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of the measure.  In the present case, the three-month period ends on 27 December next.  Alternatively, instead of opting in within this period, Ireland could do so after the proposal has been adopted.  However, it is generally better to opt in within the three-month period - all the more so in the present case because the proposal applies only to Ireland and to a limited number of other member states.  Under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required for Ireland to exercise any opt-ins.<\/p><p>  The proposed decision increases the co-financing rates under the three funds for member states which receive financial assistance under the instruments set up by the Union to help states experiencing or threatened with serious financial difficulties.  This proposal currently applies to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Romania.  The Commission has proposed that the co-financing rates for support from the funds should be increased by 20 percentage points for the states in question, subject to the overall national allocation applicable to the member state.  Thus, the normal rate of 50% would become 70% and the 75% rate for projects addressing specific priorities would become 95%. The EU has already adopted measures providing for increased co-financing under other funds, such as the Structural Fund, for member states in financial difficulty.  An important feature of the proposal, as explained in the briefing supplied to committee members, is that once an action in a specific annual programme under a fund has been co-financed at the increased rate, that will continue until the end of the eligibility period, even if the country has exited the programme.  The eligibility period of an annual programme extends for one and a half years after the year to which it relates, giving a total period of two and a half years.  This element of the proposal is appropriate because a member state, upon leaving a support mechanism, is still in transition and continues to need some special measures.  It is our intention to emerge from the EU-IMF programme at the end of 2013.  Therefore, this aspect of the proposal is very welcome from our point of view.  As will be obvious to members, this is a good-news proposal from Ireland's point of view, and the European Commission is to be commended on its introduction.  Very properly, it recognised the implications of the economic and financial crisis for the member states affected and, specifically, it saw that it would adversely affect the necessary and desirable work done with the assistance of these three funds.  The adoption of this measure will make it easier to source the necessary national matching funding, whether that comes from the State, as would be the case for the return fund, or largely from individual projects, in the case of the other two funds.  I recognise that there are always challenges in raising matching funding in the present economic climate but this proposal aims to make this objective more attainable.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, and I are strongly of the view that Ireland should opt in to this measure.  Indeed, we can hardly do otherwise, given that it was formulated with our situation in mind, as well as that of a limited number of other member states.  I commend the motion to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112800003#B00300","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1354095900,"counter":184,"content":"<p>This motion is welcome and I do not see any difficulties in supporting it.

According to figures for September 2012, a total of 5,098 people are residing in direct provision centres, of whom 1,789 are children.  They are provided with food and shelter and an allowance of &euro;19.10 per week and &euro;9.60 per child.  We are all aware of the nonsense stories about free haircuts and fancy cars.

Also, respected public figures such as the chief executive of Barnardos, Fergus Finlay, and Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness have said this is a serious case of child abuse and neglect and is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.

We are assuming that the amounts for next year will be similar, but we do not know because the budget process has yet to be concluded.  A clearer picture will emerge at a later date.  The significant aspect of this matter concerns the projects which can be undertaken within the voluntary sector.  Up until now, it would have been necessary to have 30% of the money up front in order to obtain matching funding.  Given that it is increasing to 90%, a project might only need to raise 5% and would still manage to obtain the additional funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012112800004#C00500","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1354096500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that information.

Will the increased funding available go some way towards addressing a number of the issues involved?  I refer, in particular, to the children in direct provision centres.  Some years ago I was involved with the Free Legal Advice Centres which, with several children's rights organisations, were seeking to ensure the children of refugees and asylum seekers would be entitled to child benefit on the same basis as any other child in the State.

Their applications will have a greater chance of being successful as a result of the fact that they will no longer be required to raise so much additional funding themselves.  We all know that the groups to which I refer are encountering difficulties in trying to raise money in order that they might attract matching funding.  I return to what I said about the overcrowding we have witnessed and the fact that children are living in unsuitable conditions.  Ultimately, it must always be about speeding up the process and regularising the lives of those involved.

I am pleased to attend this committee and to make a short initial presentation outlining my background and the issues facing both organisations.<\/p><p>  I grew up in Dalkey, County Dublin and was educated in Scoil Lorc&aacute;in and Col&aacute;iste Eoin.  I then attended UCD where I studied engineering, graduating in 1980.  I joined the ESB from college and worked for five years in the steam and gas turbine technical services area and trained at Brown Boveri in Switzerland and Parsons in Newcastle, England.  I was then promoted to run a section responsible for monitoring and improving power station efficiency.  While at the ESB, I also studied part-time for a master's degree in industrial engineering\/business, which I was awarded in 1985.<\/p><p>  In 1987 I moved to Irish Intercontinental Bank, then majority-owned by KBC of Belgium.  It subsequently became a fully-owned subsidiary.  I worked initially in corporate banking, but moved in 1989 to help set up the bank&rsquo;s international aircraft finance operation.  In the early 1990s I was appointed as head of the bank&rsquo;s international project finance operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The team grew rapidly, to a point where it had 30 project financiers split between Dublin and Brussels.  The team, when I was there, was responsible for several billion euro of lending for infrastructure, energy and telecommunications projects.  During that time I was involved in road projects in England, Hungary and Portugal, tunnels in Belgium, France and England and a number of bridge projects.  I was also involved in light rail projects in Manchester and Sydney.<\/p><p>  In 2000, I returned to the ESB as investment director and worked on a number of major projects in Northern Ireland, Spain and Poland.  This job helped me to look at projects from the broader perspective of an investor, rather than the narrower perspective of a lender.  I was fortunate to work for a major semi-state company which has a disciplined and highly sophisticated track record in developing major projects.  In 2003, I moved to Goodbody Corporate Finance, where I have advised a number of semi-State and private companies on energy and infrastructure projects, as well as in other areas.<\/p> <p>A number of years ago I worked with the Construction Industry Council to develop the concept of infrastructure bonds and how to use pension fund money to fund Irish infrastructure.<\/p><p> One could ask how that diverse experience is relevant to the chairmanship of the NRA and the RPA.  I have been a director of companies for almost 20 years, starting with KBC Finance Ireland, moving on to ESB subsidiaries in the UK and Europe.  In recent years I have been a director of Goodbody Corporate Finance.  I have worked on projects as an engineer, a financier and on behalf of investors.  I have advised both the public and private sector on the viability and financing of projects for almost ten years.<\/p><p> I will move on to talk about the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency.  I was approached by the Minister during the summer to chair the merger implementation group for the NRA and the RPA.  My focus since then has been on learning about the organisations and working with the two chief executives to see how best to bring these two excellent organisations together, without damaging the capability of either.  However, I am still very much a newcomer to both organisations, having only joined their boards within the last month.  I will come back to the challenge of the merger later, if I may.<\/p><p> My initial impression of both organisations is that they are well-led and competent for the tasks they have been charged with by the Minister and the State.  Many European countries have well developed road networks, and for them the challenge is to make the best use of their existing assets, using network management systems.  Other less well developed countries are focused on building a modern road network.  Ireland is probably somewhere in between, and must address both tasks simultaneously.  We have a partially modernised network that requires advanced network management.  We also have a great deal of work to do to improve those roads that are not up to standard.<\/p><p> As the members of the committee will be well aware, a high-quality national road network is critical to the country&rsquo;s economy.  National roads are enablers of sustainable growth and social interaction for every region in the country.  A trading country such as ours must have good internal transport.  Improvements to the network in recent years have been a big driver of the reduction in road traffic accidents.  Much more progress can be made in that regard.  A central task for the NRA is to continue to develop and improve the road network in all parts of the country and to manage the existing network effectively, efficiently and, above all, safely.<\/p><p> The NRA has overseen an investment of over &euro;17 billion in the last 11 years.  The major inter-urban routes are over 740 km in length, with about 470 km of other dual carriageways.  The connection of most major cities is a major achievement.  While the Celtic tiger era has left a difficult legacy, the building of this significant road network is something of which we can all be proud.  I pay tribute to the skill and dedication of the management of the NRA in achieving that.  It was ably led by Fred Barry as CEO and Peter Malone as chairman during the time.  We also have two excellent light rail lines.  <\/p><p> The RPA has overseen an investment of over &euro;1.5 billion over the last 11 years.  The infrastructure was paid for by the public purse but both lines have been able to operate to date without any funding subvention from the State.  That is a major achievement for a public transport owner and operator.  The RPA and its operator, Veolia   Transdev, continue to try to reduce costs and increase revenue where possible.  While passenger numbers fell during 2008 and 2009, they increased by 15% between 2010 and today, mainly, it has to be said, due to line extensions.  Fare revenue and ancillary revenues, such as advertising, have increased by 7% during 2012.  This has allowed recent fare increases to be limited to 2%, in line with inflation.<\/p><p> The priority projects for the NRA are the N11, Newlands Cross interchange and the N17, from Gort to Tuam.  Fred Barry recently described to the committee the NRA's drive to improve safety by eliminating the 50 most dangerous bends in the country.  The priority for light rail is the delivery of the Luas Broombridge project, announced yesterday by the Minister.  The BXD is finally connecting the two Luas lines, but also connecting Luas to much of the city centre bus network, DIT Grangegorman and commuter rail links to Maynooth and Dunboyne.  It is hoped that this integrating and connecting project will significantly reduce the number of cars in the city centre, improving the quality of life for all.  It is expected that the construction of the line will generate 800 jobs and cost in the region of &euro;370 million.  It is expected to generate between 8 million and 10 million passenger journeys, commencing in 2017.  With its focus on connectivity, Luas Broombridge should deliver a benefit to cost ratio in excess of 2:1.  This project comes on the back of the successful execution of three extensions to the Luas network.  The success of the RPA in the execution of Luas has been recognised in that it has contracts advising the cities of Bergen and Utrecht about their plans to introduce light rail.<\/p><p> However, the RPA and the NRA face real challenges in the immediate period ahead.  The first and most important of these is the merger of the two organisations.  That has to be done in a manner which preserves the competence and motivation of the excellent staff in both organisations.  There is still some distance to go in the merger and I will devote significant energy to achieving this in the coming months.  The current target is to have a single functioning organisation by the third quarter of next year, subject to legislation being ready.  The merger must take place in an open and transparent manner and I will work with the two chief executives to achieve that.<\/p><p> The second challenge facing the new organisation is to fund future infrastructure.  I will assist in any way I can to find innovative financing solutions to Ireland's infrastructure needs.  I have had the good fortune to have worked on the financing of infrastructure across Europe, as well as in the US and Asia.  I acknowledge that financing is both in short supply and expensive.  We will work with the relevant Departments to ensure that we apply rigorous cost benefit analysis to all projects.<\/p><p> The third challenge the new organisation will face is to maintain the excellent infrastructure that we already have.  I am conscious that in the coming year we will not be able to maintain the existing road network as well as we would like.  Cutting back on motorway maintenance expenditure is not a serious issue for a year or two.  However, as the backlog builds up and deterioration accelerates, there comes a time when maintenance will have to receive funding priority if many of the achievements of the past are not to be lost.<\/p><p> The fourth challenge I see is the need to continue to contain and reduce costs.  I have been impressed by how effectively the NRA and the RPA have reduced their staffing numbers in recent years in response to reduced levels of activity.  Both organisations have reduced central numbers by approximately 30%.  The NRA, in its oversight of the regional design offices, NRDOs, has gone even further in reducing staff there by about 50%.  In the merger, I will work with the management to maximise synergies and reduce costs where possible.<\/p><p> The fifth challenge, and probably the most important, is to maintain the competence built up by the CEOs of both organisations, Fred Barry and Frank Allen, over the last ten years.  There is a need to maintain a critical mass of competence for both roads and light rail in the face of budgetary cuts.  While the Government is intent on reducing the size of the public sector, given the need to reduce expenditure, it should not penalise organisations which have been lean and have outsourced as much work as possible in the past.  The new organisation should not suffer a disproportionate cut to its staff numbers because of previous prudent stewardship or to meet arbitrary employment control framework numbers.  There is a real danger that when we, as a country, are again in a position to invest in roads and light rail, the new organisation will have lost key experienced personnel.  The cost to the country of not having the right procurement staff in place in the future will far outweigh any possible savings to be made now from cutting small numbers of staff.  I believe that the CEO of the new merged entity, Fred Barry, expressed his concerns on this matter to the committee when appearing before it recently.<\/p><p> It will be a privilege for me to become chairman of the NRA and the RPA and to oversee the merger of these two fine organisations.  I look forward to working with the boards, the executive and the staff of both organisations as they merge into a stronger single entity.  My goal as chairman will be to lead the board in an effective and efficient manner and to work closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to implement the policy objectives communicated by the Minister.  It is, I believe, a part of the chairman&rsquo;s role to ensure strong communication and transparency between the company and the Department and I have found the Department to be both helpful and supportive over the last number of months.<\/p> <p>I intend to challenge and encourage the chief executive and the management team to do more with less and to develop both our road and light rail networks to the best of our ability within severe budgetary constraints.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee.  I look forward to working with them in the future and to a time when I can return with a greater level of knowledge of both the new organisation and its important work than that which I possess today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354095900,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his fairly impressive presentation.

Getting this merger over the line is, however, going to present a hugely significant challenge, particularly in the context of staff, management and the engineering cohort of both organisations.  When the merger has been completed, does Mr. O'Rourke anticipate that conflicts may arise in the context of how the NRA traditionally delivers projects?  If such conflicts do arise, how might they be resolved?<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Rourke indicated that the existing staff expertise is very important and must be maintained.  I submit that in the coming years the challenges to be faced will, in the context of the type of expertise that will be required, be much different to those which obtained during the past 15 years.  In the latter period, what was being done revolved around land acquisitions and building new roads.  In the future, the emphasis will be on maintaining the new roads that have been built.  In the context of rail procurement, the focus will probably be on upgrading existing lines rather than constructing new ones.  Does Mr. O'Rourke envisage that many of the existing staff will be moved on and that new people will be brought in to deal with these challenges?

Obviously, he will face many challenges.  It appears that during the coming months he will primarily be engaged in dealing with the merger.<\/p><p>  Is Mr. O'Rourke in a position to provide an indication of the funding requirements in respect of the maintenance of our national network?  Many present will recall that one of the most damaging aspects of the previous recession in the 1980s was the lack of money available for road maintenance and the fact that it took in the region of ten to 15 years to correct the position because our roads had deteriorated to such an enormous degree.  Our climate, as much as anything else, is responsible for causing the erosion of our roads.  Certainly regional and local roads were affected by erosion in the 1980s and I am sure the position regarding our new motorways is no different.  Is Mr. O'Rourke in a position to outline the budgetary requirements and can he indicate from where the moneys required will come?<\/p><p>  I appreciate that the new organisation will be dependent on the Minister and general Government policy in this regard and that it will only be able to operate on the basis of the money available to it.  However, I am sure Mr. O'Rourke is going to exert pressure on the Government and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in order to ensure that as much money as is required will be forthcoming.  In that context and in light of his own background, will Mr. O'Rourke indicate the role he believes public private partnerships will play in respect of the future of the new agency?  In recent weeks the ESB, with which Mr. O'Rourke was previously employed, issued a bond which was oversubscribed to an enormous degree.  This suggests that investors who may have stayed away from Ireland in recent years are returning in droves in order to invest their money here.  Is Mr. O'Rourke of the view that this may herald something of a change?<\/p><p>  Like Deputy Ellis, I am a strong supporter of metro north and am of the view that it is a shame that it has been shelved.  I would like to believe that when the merger takes place, the new organisation will press the Government to come up with funding.  I understand that the Government must fund a certain element of any PPP.  When the Minister shelved the project, he indicated that there was no private investment available.  However, it appears that the position in this regard has changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800005#D00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354095900,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I will first address the issue of the merger and the possibility of job losses.  What we are doing in this regard represents a major challenge.  However, there is not a huge overlap between the two companies.  One is a road management and road building company and the other is a railway procurement company.  The overlap tends to be in the central areas.  It will be another few weeks before we finish the organisational design.  I do not expect there to be significant job losses.  There will undoubtedly be some retraining and redeployment but I do not expect significant job losses in either organisation.  It is a little early to say what will be the position.  We have had a first cut at the organisational design and we are now trying to refine it and check what we have done is correct.<\/p><p>  I am very familiar with the north-west link, particularly as I travel to Donegal from time to time.  As far as I am aware, there is no funding available for this project and it has not appeared on any list of proposed projects.  I understand Mr. Fred Barry discussed this matter with the committee on the previous occasion on which he appeared before it.  I would be delighted to have money to spend on this project but it is not a priority at present.  In the coming couple of years, the priority projects will be the N11, the Newlands Cross interchange and the N17 from Gort to Tuam.<\/p> <p>Clearly, if funding becomes available for that in the stimulus package, then the next ones are the Enniscorthy and New Ross roads.<\/p><p> There is no point in being disingenuous with the committee about BXD.  It will involve a certain level of disruption.  We are putting in place significant consultation between the NTA, the RPA and local business interests.  We will try our very best to minimise disruption.  One of the strengths of the RPA, which we were talking about yesterday at the board, is that when it finishes a project it sits down and instead of patting itself on the back, figures out what it could have done better and asks what lessons have been learned.  In that way, it has kept fresh the mistakes that have been made.  Engineers are not perfect.  I speak as one myself.  We all make mistakes.  In those circumstances, it is a very strong tool to sit down after a project and say this and this could have been done better and this is how, so it stays in the culture of the organisation.  Having recently done three extension projects, the RPA is in a much better position to manage BXD in a way that minimises disruption.<\/p><p> I share the committee&rsquo;s view on metro north.  I would love to be in a position for the RPA to build it but the money is not there at the moment.  It is a large project.  Any of us who has been in cities that have good metro networks would love to have one in Dublin.  I am an optimist by nature.  We will get to a point where we will be able to build such major projects, not just light rail but also roads.  I would love to see the western corridor and the link to the north west completed.  We will get back there but for the immediate period, we are not going to see metro north on the books.<\/p><p> We are keen to keep the railway order alive so that we have the option.  One of my jobs in a time of straitened circumstances is to keep options alive.  The metro north planning permission will be kept fresh so that if the money becomes available, we can go ahead and build it.  Similarly, with road projects, where we have planning permission if money becomes available, whether it is through Europe or directly from the Government, I would love to be in a position to be able to pull down the planning permission and get on with the project.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Harrington&rsquo;s question about conflicts in the NRA and the RPA, I do not see that.  In many ways the two chief executives have done extremely well in working together.  There has been no conflict at all.  In many ways their skills are complementary.  They are basically both procurement agencies and one of the strengths of bringing these two organisations together is that one can have two lots of people who have worked on different types of procurement being able to cross-fertilise their ideas.  It will be good for both of them.  They can bounce ideas off one another.<\/p><p> Deputy Harrington is right about staff expertise in that there is a different expertise in building and maintenance but they are professionals and they are well capable of being retrained and moving from building to maintenance.  As an engineer, I like to see both of those skillsets in the one organisation in order that both the operation and maintenance and building skills are complementary.  The lessons one learns in one are transferable to the other.  Fred Barry has done a lot of that with the NRA.  Many of the people who were involved in building the network are now involved in both operation and maintenance.  I feel very strongly that as a country we have just got to keep that expertise in those organisations.  They are professional people.  They will not be idle.  They will be getting ready for new projects and maintaining the existing framework.  From that point of view, I hope that when we have money again we will be in a position to start out and not to have to wait around for planning permission.<\/p><p> In terms of Senator Mooney&rsquo;s questions on the funding requirement, we reckon we are approximately &euro;100 million short for maintenance this year, but there is a level of flexibility and the organisation is very well equipped, where there is an emergency or deterioration, to move money between budgets, subject to the agreement of the Department.  It is not quite as rigid as it would first appear, but we are short of money.  Part of my job is to fight for that maintenance budget so that we do not allow valuable infrastructure to deteriorate.<\/p><p> Moving on to the role of public private partnerships, there has been a great development within recent weeks in the closing of the schools bundle three.  It is a major achievement for the National Development Finance Agency.  Many of the issues which arose in trying to get that schools bundle closed should be able to transfer to the N11-Newlands Cross project.  We are hopeful that will close in quarter two.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s optimism.  It is good that we are finally beginning to see money flow to this country.  The bond that the ESB issued was hugely oversubscribed, which is positive.  Similarly, there was huge oversubscription for bonds.  That is a positive for this country.<\/p><p> The National Treasury Management Agency is doing a good job of selling this country.  It behoves all of us to interact where we can with people and to tell the positives about the Irish story.  It is not all doom and gloom.  I meet international financiers and undoubtedly there is a move back towards considering this country in a much more positive light.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354096500,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I asked a question about the gates.

I wish him success with the two merged agencies.  I very much welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of the Luas BXD line to join up the two existing Luas lines and to connect up with other services as well.  The construction of the line will cause a number of problems and headaches.  Reference has been made to some of them already.  I understand that it is proposed to bring the Luas line around by College Green.  That would leave very little room for any other kind of traffic.  How will it be dealt with in terms of the overall transport layout and services that use College Green?  It is a key route for cross-city traffic.<\/p><p>  The other question I wished to raise relates to the Luas and safety.  As it is an on-street tram system using the same road space as other traffic, safety must be the highest priority.  There have been a number of high profile accidents in recent years.  One was a crash between a Luas tram and a bus at the junction of O&rsquo;Connell Street and Abbey Street.  A number of people were injured but thankfully no one was fatally injured.  Nevertheless, I understand the Luas crashed through a green light for some reason.  More recently the Luas was out of action for the better part of a day because of a collision between a bin truck and a Luas tram in the Smithfield area.  Inevitably, accidents will happen but we must be assured that safety is of the highest standard.  When one is travelling on public transport one does not expect to be involved in a collision with another vehicle.<\/p><p>  Another issue relates to the problem of crime and anti-social behaviour on the Luas red line.  Frequently, we hear of tourists who travel from Heuston Station to the city centre on the Luas and have wallets or cameras stolen.  There is a need for personal passenger security and safety on the red line in particular.  There is a problem with drugs on parts of the line as well.  There is a need for on-board security on the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800006#E00600","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1354097100,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Rourke for outlining his curriculum vitae.

If the sale of those assets does not go ahead as quickly as planned, does that mean the project will be delayed?<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Rouke said that we also have a great deal of work to do to improve those roads that are not up to standard.

I am concerned by his statement on the maintenance of the motorways and that the funding is &euro;100 million short.  Effectively, if there is a shortfall for the maintenance of motorways, is there any provision for the maintenance of secondary routes or will they revert to dirt tracks in the next few years?<\/p><p>  When Mr. Barry last came before the committee I put to him the legacy issues arising from the construction of motorways, the snag list, the lack of accountability and the relationship with the local authorities, the grey areas such as flooding, where individuals are being sent from local authorities to the NRA and back again with no resolution of the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800007#F00100","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1354097100,"counter":242,"content":"<p>As no other member is offering, I will follow up on the issue of maintenance both of motorways and the main roads.

College Green is a key hub and most of the traffic coming from the south side is being diverted through Tara Street to the quays. It is a vital transport link. When the Railway Order was being granted, much of the traffic management issues were dealt with by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I do not know what trade offs were agreed during the planning process. Clearly there were a number of trade offs between Bus &Eacute;ireann and Luas. There is no simple answer but we have managed the traffic on Harcourt Street. With proper planning and co-ordination between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Luas we can overcome the difficulties.<\/p><p>  I share the Deputy's concerns about safety. The safety of both passengers and staff is absolutely paramount. All incidents are logged, from a brush with a person who may not even stay around to more serious cases, and they are reviewed. The board of the RPA conducts a review every month of all of the incidents and reviews all cases to see if there are trends to ensure further training is not required. Mistakes will be made, perhaps as a result of tiredness or otherwise. We keep under active review the question of whether staff need further training.<\/p><p>  We discussed the anti-social behaviour on the Red Line at the RPA board meeting yesterday. We are working very actively with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to stamp out anti-social behaviour on the Red Line. There are mobile patrols on board to deal with fare evasion and anti-social behaviour. We have a Garda presence on board and continue to provide that over time.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony raised the question of funding projects. The future of public private partnership funding is, I hope, bright. All the indications are that we have overcome all the issues. It is the only form of finance we can find at present. It is very difficult for the Exchequer to fund road projects directly. I agree with the Deputy that some of the roads are not up to scratch. The NRA has developed a very sophisticated condition monitoring system to assess the condition of the roads and a review system for the bends and other unsafe areas. As money permits, we gradually work our way through the list of priority safety areas on the national routes. We will spend &euro;380 million this year on 500 individual projects on the national primary roads. While that is a great deal of money, it is not as much as we would like to spend and is not as much as we would have had in the past. As the Deputy knows, the NRA does not have a role in secondary roads.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony raised the question of legacy snags, but as I was not aware of the interface problem between the local authorities and the NRA, I must speak to Mr. Fred Barry about it to see if we can find a way to resolve these issues. It does not seem satisfactory that people are being passed from Billy to Jack. That is no way to deal with the public.<\/p><p>  I share the Chairman's concern about cutting the grass verges. Where public-private companies have been involved in road projects, the grass areas tend to be cut, as this is part of their performance criteria. Where the project is in public control and is one of the areas where we can potentially cut costs, they are not as well maintained as they should be. It can be quite unsightly and this should be looked at, but it is a question of priority. Do we straighten out a dangerous bend or do we cut the grass?

Were motorway traffic projections over-egged, so to speak?<\/p><p> I have a question about the issue of climate change and our carbon targets.  The advent of motorways has presented a significant challenge to efforts to persuade people to use public transport.  Will Mr. O'Rourke hazard a guess at a timeline for the New Ross-Enniscorthy road?  Motorway surfaces are grey and rain is grey.  I have noticed that very few lorries seem to have wheel skirts to prevent spray.  It is particularly difficult to drive on a motorway in such conditions.  We all know it is necessary to reduce speed in those conditions but this is a regular weather feature in Ireland.   I acknowledge the difficulties faced by the road haulage sector and I do not wish to impose further regulation on the industry.  However, it would be preferable for lorries to use wheel skirts in order to prevent spray from rising on motorways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800007#F00500","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354097700,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that the motorway network appears to have had an impact on the railways.  The rail service is fine for getting from one city centre to another.  However, it is probably easier to travel by road when going to areas such as west Cork.<\/p><p>  On the question about traffic projections, as I understand it, traffic increases in direct proportion to GDP and I think everyone got those rates wrong.  Undoubtedly we got the traffic projections for motorways wrong at the time, mostly because everyone, myself included, was over-optimistic about GDP growth rates.  I agree with the Deputy that we would probably get the biggest bang for our buck on climate change through the use of public transport in cities rather than transport outside those areas.  It is also relevant with regard to mainline rail.  My understanding of climate change is that we are a lot closer to our targets but for all the wrong reasons; it is as a result of the lack of growth rather than any proactive actions on our part.  Climate change problems are a result of economic success.  It would be a good problem for the country to have.<\/p><p>  We are working with the Department in the hope that projects such as the New Ross-Enniscorthy road can be started in advance of the sale of State assets.  Once the issue of the sale of State assets has been resolved - once we know the funding is in place - we would hope to commence in advance of the funds becoming available.  However, I do not have a date for that.<\/p><p>  I share the Deputy's concerns about visibility when driving on motorways in the rain.  Lorries at speed are particularly dangerous.  I suspect this issue may come under the remit of the Road Safety Authority rather than the National Roads Authority.  I will come back to the Deputy on that.  Anything which reduces spray levels on motorways is to be welcomed.  It is the case that drivers do not slow down in bad wet conditions.  Driving through spray is very dangerous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac O'Rourke"},{"type":"speech","time":1354097700,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I have one question about speed limits on motorways.

I was born and reared in Ashford, County Wicklow.  I am married to Jane and we have two boys, Giles and Philip.  All of my working life has been spent in active involvement in the business community of Wicklow town and county.  I have submitted a brief curriculum vitae to the committee but I will deal with some aspects of it.<\/p><p>  Since 1980 I have been managing director of my own company, Wire Ropes Limited, based in Wicklow town.  The company employs between 20 and 70 people.  The number of employees was 70 in the very best of times but the number is much lower now.  Between 1982 and 1990, I was president of the County Wicklow region of the Federated Union of Employers, now IBEC.  I gained much of my knowledge and information on industrial relations and corporate governance during that period.  We served all companies from Baltinglass to south Arklow and Gorey.  In 1983 and 1984 I was president of the Wicklow and District Chamber of Commerce.  This provided a good opportunity to meet with prospective investors in the Wicklow area and to work with the IDA in attracting new business to the area.  It was a good business experience for me.<\/p> <p>In 1984 I was appointed to the board of the Wicklow Harbour Commissioners which was my first experience of corporate port business.  In 1991-92 I was elected chairman of the Wicklow Harbour Commissioners.  In 1991, I was appointed to the board of the Wicklow County Enterprise Board.  It is an excellent organisation, very well managed and a great place to learn about small businesses, grant schemes, etc.  In 1991, I was also appointed to the board of management of Abbey Community College.  In 1992, I was elected to the national executive of the Small Firms Association.  It is another excellent organisation, the annual general meeting of which I will attend this afternoon following this meeting.  I have remained on the executive of that organisation and I have found it to be of great benefit to me in business during the past 18 to 20 years.  In 2002, I was appointed to the board of the Wicklow Port Company when it was corporatised and during the period 2002 to 2012, I was chairman of the port company audit committee.  I served for one year on the National Economic and Social Council and I also serve on the audit committee of the county enterprise board.  <\/p><p> To move on from my personal details to the company, I will focus a little on the past.  Members may ask why I would do that.  The reason is that Wicklow is interesting from a historical point of view.  In a book, <i>Wicklow Harbour - A History,<\/i>written by Jimmy Cleary and Andrew O'Brien, it is reported that the Vikings first came to Wicklow in 827 AD and they plied their long boats up and down the coast around the Wicklow-Arklow area.  Norwegian and Irish were spoken at that time and it is reported to be from the Viking era that Wicklow got its name, from the old Norse name Vikingalo.  The next settlers were the Anglo Normans in 1170.  Moving on to 1881, a new breakwater at Wicklow Port was constructed under an Act of Parliament in the reign of Queen Victoria and 200 men were employed at the peak of its construction.  Currently it is the east pier at Wicklow Harbour.<\/p><p> Moving on to the present time, a number of leisure and community groups operate in the port and contribute to the local community.  They include the two Wicklow sailing clubs, the rowing club, the swimming club, the diving club, the sub aqua club, the Chamber of Commerce, the RNLI, the Coast Guard and others.  We will continue to liaise with these community groups within our terms of reference.<\/p><p> The Round Ireland Yacht Race, a biannual, 704 mile international event in the yachting calendar, of which members may be aware, starts and finishes in Wicklow Harbour.  It has now grown to be an excellent visitor tourist and leisure attraction and is greatly enhanced by the weekend Sailfest festival organised to attract visitors to Wicklow Town during the race.  The Wicklow Regatta Festival is held annually on the August bank holiday weekend within the port limits and is the oldest regatta festival in Ireland.  It is over 134 years old.<\/p><p> The location of Wicklow Port and the Wicklow Town relief road are two of the best kept secrets in Wicklow and the east coast.  The port is strategically placed to give access to the north, the south and the west.  On leaving the port, if one wants to travel north, one joins the N11, comes onto the M50 and one can be at the Sandyford roundabout in 30 minutes.  If one wants to travel south, having travelled 3 km from the port, one joins the N11 heading south and one can be at the Gorey roundabout in 30 minutes, from which one can continue on to New Ross, Wexford and the south Wicklow hinterlands.<\/p><p> The future plans for the Wicklow Port include a five-year rolling plan, projections and budget and that plan will be updated on a yearly basis.  <\/p><p> I have set out in my submission statistics covering imports and exports for the 2007-12 period.  Focusing on 2007, the level of imports through the harbour was 221,000 tonnes and an indication of the death of the Celtic tiger is that the level of imports dropped to 84,000 tonnes in 2008 and they have dropped gradually by 60% to 70% and then by 80%.  The imports reflect a reliance on one product in particular, namely, timber for housing purposes, in the years up to 2007.<\/p><p> Another cost item is dredging.  There are plans for a dredging programme in the harbour and it is awaiting a decision from the EPA.<\/p><p> To give an overview of how the port is doing, Wicklow Port is a small company.  It is a mean, lean operation, with a decent balance sheet and no pension shortfall.  All outstanding loans will be cleared in 2013.  In addition, the port company does not directly incur the cost of employing dockers or cargo handling machinery, cranes, fork-lifts etc., as these are provided by the stevedores and ships agents company, R. F. Conway and Company.  Consequently, Wicklow Port is one of the most efficient and competitive ports on the east coast.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, the downturn in the economy since 2007 has meant that the company is treading water while waiting for the economy to improve.  This is similar to many small companies at present but in Wicklow, imports were seriously affected by the downturn in the construction industry where the main imported product, timber, suffered a reduction of 60% per annum.  In addition, imports of plasterboard almost ceased through Wicklow Port.<\/p><p> However, I am optimistic that our economy will recover from this deep depression.  Ireland is regaining its competitiveness with exports increasing by 15% since 2009.  With action having been taken on the sovereign debt and, hopefully, a deal from the EU on our bank debt, I believe we can bounce back from this dark economic period.  With a resumption in growth, there is no better barometer for the health of an export-led economy like ours than the country's ports, of which Wicklow Port is a good example.<\/p><p> While accepting that these are difficult times for small indigenous industries, there are many comparisons between running a small port company like Wicklow Port and an SME like my own.  In 2008 my company was faced with a serious downturn in business, like many other small firms in the country and to the credit of the staff, including the managing director, it was agreed to take a reduction in salary rather than reduce the number of staff and the shareholders have agreed to forego any dividend since 2009.<\/p><p> From my experience of business culture here, I have learned over many years of my adult life to protect the balance sheet and to retain a healthy bank balance, thereby providing for the rainy day or recession.  This is particularly relevant now as cashflow problems cannot be currently remedied by bank borrowing.  This is the same philosophy that has seen the port company through the current recession.<\/p><p> While we in the port company are poised to take advantage of any pick-up in the economy we have not been complacent in our search for other products to import or export.  Currently, we are exporting a new product, RDS, a refuse-derived fuel, which is being exported to Germany and Holland where it is used for fuel their national grids.  We are hopeful this will become a regular export of 50,000 tonnes per annum.  In addition, scrap metal continues to be one of the more recent growing exports from Wicklow.<\/p> <p>Glass cullet is another recent export product coming through the port from County Kildare.  Any improvement in the economy will see some improvements in timber imports.<\/p><p> One of the highlights of the past five years for Wicklow Port Company has been the completion of the port town relief road at a cost of circa &euro;60 million.  There was also the agreement to spend a sum of &euro;1 million between the town council and Wicklow Port Company in upgrading the South Quay, which is the town's relief main street.  This was done by way of an agreement and f&iacute;xed contract with the town council.  That gave me some pleasure because I insisted on the legal agreement and fixed contract.  To the credit of the town council and the contractors, the job was completed at a fixed price.  That happens only on rare occasions and we were very pleased with the outcome.  Another highlight was the return of the Murrough Compound, owned by the port company adjacent to the port, under a CPO by the county council for the construction of the port relief road.  It has been considerably improved and returned in an environmentally friendly state, for which we thank the county council on its efficiency.  Also the registration of all the company's property is now in the process of being completed.  I thank the former chairman, Mr. Fachtna Whittle, and the law agent, Ms Deirdre Burke, for their help in expediting these issues.  I record my thanks to the former chairman, Mr. Fachtna Whittle, for his service to the company and the courtesy he extended to me and my board colleagues during his period as chairman from 2002 to 2012.  For me the most satisfying aspect of the past five years at Wicklow Port Company is the honour that goes with the decision to have Wicklow Port Company remain in the commercial State sector.<\/p><p> Other important issues to be considered for the future include a survey\/analysis of the company's fixed assets values, including depreciation.  Private investment for construction of a marina should not be ignored.  A feasibility study on marketing and future developments should also be considered.<\/p><p> Small companies are the lifeblood of the economy and we would be a poorer place without a commercial port company in Wicklow.  I intend that the company will return the trust placed in it and the best way of doing that is to return to profitability.  I intend to advise the new board that there are some issues on which we will keep an open mind, such as partnerships, outsourcing etc.<\/p><p> On the issue of the current review of port's policy, whatever policy is adopted, it is a matter on which I shall lead and implement with the board, on behalf of the shareholder, if confirmed as chairman of Wicklow Port Company. <\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee and for their time and patience.  I do not mind repeating that Wicklow Port Company is an efficient and competitive company and we are ready to start work.  In the event of being confirmed as chairman of Wicklow Port Company, I look forward to working with the appointed directors.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800008#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Newsome","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354098900,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Newsome for a thorough explanation of his position.

We are always looking for more business.  The larger ports take the largest tonnage in any product.  We are limited to looking for niche markets which I mentioned in my submission such as scrap metal and RDF.  RDF is a new product and about which we are very excited because we expect a minimum of 50,000 tonnes per annum.  RDF is a win-win because it takes pressure off the country generally from the point of view of landfill, as landfill is running out and the European Union is becoming concerned about our reliance on landfill.  Given that millions of tonnes of refuse is going into landfill, a start has been made to put it into RDF.  It is packaged and wrapped four to five times and arrives in a bale, the shape of a glass.  There is approximately a tonne in each bale and a ship takes 3,500 tonnes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800010#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Newsome"},{"type":"speech","time":1354099500,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Where does it come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800011#K00100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354099500,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The RDF comes from the Greyhound company in Dublin city.   The company packages the bales.  There was initially a slight perfume off them, but the wrapping is solving that problem.  If they get wet, there is a slight problem, but the company has worked on it and it has turned out to be a win-win because the reliance on landfill sites has been reduced.  We are falling into a trap in this regard and will be penalised if we do not scale down the reliance on landfill sites.  The bales go to Germany and Holland where they are incinerated and the energy generated is fed into their national grids.  One might ask why we do not have incineration facilities, but that is a different discussion.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Dessie Ellis's question about more business, we hope that if there is a levelling off or even an upturn, there will be a return to timber.  We only need approximately 5,000 tonnes to double the current tonnage in the port.  Wicklow Port was one of the biggest importers of timber.  However, we lost one of our plasterboard products as a result of competition from our big brother in town, but we will not complain about competition because we are heavily engaged in it and remain one of the most competitive ports on the east coast.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked how many we employed.  We have a chief executive officer who is the harbour master and has a part-time secretary in the office.  We also have a general operative.  They are the directly employed personnel, but most of the people working in the port are from Wicklow and employed by the stevedores who employ people to operate cranes, hoists and forklifts.  A carrier company also employs many people.<\/p><p>  We work closely with the chamber of commerce which is also involved in tourism and, for example, in developing the old jail in the town.  Wicklow Port is less than 100 yards from the main street and, therefore, close to activities in the town.  That is one reason the expenditure of &euro;1 million on the south quay was a big help to those on the main street because we are able to divert traffic on to the quay and it is a much better organised and efficient service.<\/p><p>  With regard to our aims for the future, we are still looking for niche products that can be exported in a reasonably good manner from the port.  Like my own company, when there is a recession, sales are down.  On the financial side, no matter how much costs are controlled, there will be no miracles if a company does not retain sales.  That is where we are and competition is fierce.  Not only are we experiencing a recession, everybody else is cutting costs and looking for a slice of the action.  While the port continues to seek niche business, we are under no illusions about the challenge to be faced in the next few years until the economy recovers to a reasonable level.  I am confident that will happen, given the manner in which issues are being tackled.  I do not know that there is much more about which I can assure the Deputy.<\/p><p>  We continue to seek opportunities with the help of the chief executive officer and the stevedores who are in the marketplace all the time looking for more business.  I am happy and confident that business will pick up, but the secret is when a company is in a depression, that it must look after its cash because it will not get any when it runs out from the banks.  That has been a good policy for my company and I try to use the same criterion as chairman of the port audit committee.  It is not the most popular thing to do to tell others that we should hold on to money until the economy picks up and that we should wait to see how our operating accounts are going.  We should not spend it all in one go and be forced to go to the banks which will say \"No\".  We would then have to go the Minister who will say he cannot give it to us and the Department will also state there is no money available.  Our policy to date has been prudent and wise in preserving our balance sheet and cash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Newsome"},{"type":"speech","time":1354099500,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I had a question about the leisure industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800011#K00300","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354099500,"counter":267,"content":"<p>There is an opportunity in that sector to seek people who might be prepared to invest, perhaps through a public private partnership, in the development of a marina.

Wales has such a project but it is not related to ports alone.  One should have an open mind on the idea.  There are many reasons for the port authorities in Wicklow, New Ross, Rosslare and Wexford to talk.  The patch seems to be little overcrowded at present and there is insufficient business.  There are too many companies for the amount of business generated.  In Wicklow, we have no illusions about the fact that the challenge is quite serious.  If one does not hold or improve sales, cutting costs, to whatever extent, will not be a magic bullet for anything.  We all know that.<\/p><p>  Regarding the largest ship size, we take in ships with a capacity of up to approximately 3,000 tonnes.  A dredging programme is planned and we await the decision of the EPA, which must move a little slowly at times, on the improvement of dredging in the harbour.  With improved dredging, we would take in somewhat bigger ships.<\/p><p>  The River Vartry flows through Ashford, the village in which I live.  I recall the river being flooded and thousands of salmon going up the weir towards Roundwood and spawning.  An agreement was reached whereby Dublin Corporation could take a lot of water to supply Stillorgan and south Dublin.  On the statute, which I was very interested to see, there is an agreement whereby the corporation would assist with the clearance of the river, by way of dredging, from Roundwood to Ashford and into Wicklow Harbour.  If X million gallons of water are taken from the river, the flow is very often reduced to a trickle.  When the water reached the harbour, sluicing was not occurring to the extent that it had been up to 1948.  Consequently, the requirement for dredging is more regular than it was heretofore.  Perhaps it was hardly needed in the past.  I would be very interested in knowing the fate of the plan by Dublin Corporation to assist in the debt associated with clearing the harbour as a result of its taking the water into south Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Newsome"},{"type":"speech","time":1354100100,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I do not know whether we can bring it before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800012#L00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354100100,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The cost of a complete dredging plan is now approximately &euro;250,000.

The port did not fall into the trap of having significant defined-benefit pension plans.  There are strategic reasons for the low figure.  It is partly due to the age of the personnel.  There is a defined-contribution plan in place, contributed to by the members.  There is no negative aspect to the pension.  We are very lucky in that respect because most pension schemes in port companies and State companies, and many private companies, are in deficit.

It is interesting to hear the questions asked and the level of surprise among contributors that the company has accounts in balance and that it has no extended debt or pension burden of any significance.  As the chairman designate said, the port has managed to tread the water healthily while waiting for circumstances to improve.  There is a lesson to be learned from that.  Mr. Newsome says it is the best-kept secret.  It certainly is but we just heard of Dublin City Council's best-kept secret, which we will have to investigate.  If the agreement is on statute, it is on statute; it is as simple as that.  We should examine the matter.  The amount of water the council takes from Vartry Reservoir leaves the flow very small at times.<\/p><p>  Wicklow Port is the only port in the country at which water, rail and road infrastructure meet at one point.  When there is capacity overflow in Dublin, for example, Wicklow is regarded as a handy alternative.  When business is tighter, business tends to be sucked back to the middle.  As Mr. Newsome stated, the port ought to be competitive.<\/p><p>  I have noticed an increase in the number of fishing vessels landing their catches in Wicklow.  Has Mr. Newsome any figures on that?  Are there any attempts at further development in this regard?  Is there sufficient capacity to generate secondary employment or industry in this area?  I refer to processing and marketing.  A fish retail outlet opened on South Quay in the past 12 or 18 months.<\/p> <p> Second, Mr. Newsome answered the question about the vessels' capacity, but what is the number of vessels inward and outward at the port?  It is operating at a second level now, but what is its maximum potential if it could expand?  Is it double, treble or quadruple?  As a commercial port company, it would be interesting to know the amount of slack it can take up and its capacity to develop more business.  I believe it is looking at other innovative businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800012#L00800","speaker":"1103","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354100700,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Newsome the best of luck in his appointment as chairman of the port company.  He obviously has an intimate knowledge of the company, having been involved in it for a number of years.  That knowledge is reflected in the issue he raised about the statute and Dublin Corporation.  Perhaps he should put it on the agenda for his first meeting and write to Dublin Corporation and quote the statute.  Dublin City Council is fairly adept at following up commitments itself.  Certainly, we should write to it about it because it is a legitimate issue.<\/p><p>  Wicklow Port and Arklow Port sometimes remind me of old traditional golf clubs in that there is a particular group that uses them but other people do not know what happens or are afraid to get involved.  I realise that is a quite simplistic view.  However, when Mr. Newsome takes over as chairman he will hopefully have a very progressive board and there is an opportunity for a new beginning, although it is important to acknowledge the work the others have done in the past.  Perhaps a public meeting should be held to change the mindset a little and make people in the broader area more aware, as that awareness is often lacking, of what is there, what the company is doing and that it is open for business.<\/p><p>  If Mr. Newsome were to pick a single issue that is holding back the development of the port, aside from the obvious one he mentioned about an investor to construct the breakwater and pier, what would it be and what can the committee do to try to assist him and the port company to develop?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012112800013#M00200","speaker":"1104"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354100700,"counter":288,"content":"<p>With regard to what is holding us back, if I could wave a magic wand and get rid of Dublin Port, it would solve half of our problems because we could improve our business dramatically.  However, that is not going to happen.  I am not aware of anything that is holding us back at present.  The stevedoring company protects the company from the point of view that it is not a cost or burden on the company.  It has resolved the employment issue with the dockers.  It deals with that and we do not employ dockers in the port.  The stevedoring company pays the people to drive the fork-lifts, cranes, carriages, lorries and so forth.  It is a very go-ahead company.  There are people who would say it is not able to deal with it because they do not get on with it but that is not my experience.  My experience of the company, especially the stevedores of R. F. Conway &amp;amp; Company Limited, is that they are very co-operative.  They will deal with any new business, niche or otherwise.<\/p><p>  The statistics from 2007 to 2012 refer to the capacity, which Deputy Doyle mentioned.  We are way down, at about 70% or 80% less, on 2007.  One could take the 2007 figure, multiply it by two and consider that our capacity.  We have a long way to go to get back to the 2007 level and I do not wish to give anybody the impression that it is going to happen this side of the recession being resolved, because it will not happen in that timeframe.  However, as a competitive company, we are ready to pick up once the recession starts to be resolved and if Europe is kind in giving us some money for our bank debt, we should move forward.  I have no doubt that the will and energy are there, and it is my intention to move forward.  My own business, which is in the port area, is a multiple of the size of the port in terms of financials, sales and so forth, but the same principles apply whether one's company is large or small.  As I always repeat, one does not need to be a rocket scientist.  One must control and preserve one's balance sheet and cash so one is not running to the bank, which will more than likely give one a Harvey Smith and say it has no money.
