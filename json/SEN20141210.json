Obviously, it will take some time for the Government to respond.  I see the HSE has made a comment already, but there is a wider issue here.  The Leas Cross situation was in my own area ten years ago, which people will remember as quite similar to this but for more elderly people also.  While the regulations have changed and improved and we hope that in most areas they are observed, situations like the one we saw last night are obviously unacceptable.  We must do everything in our power to address it.<\/p><p>The people who perpetrated these acts are fully qualified.  People can talk about management and resources but this involved a one-to-one patient to staff ratio.  It was not about underfunding or lack of resources from what I could see.  It was about the type of people and the lack of respect and dignity they afforded our most vulnerable people who need to be cared for.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  At the appropriate time, I am sure we will have a proper and meaningful debate on the matter.  Perhaps, we can get the Minister in to see how we can ensure that these things do not happen in future.  As I said, it is ten years since Leas Cross, but we are back here again.<\/p><p>I put colleagues on notice that Aer Lingus is holding its EGM at the airport in Swords at 2 p.m. today.  The shareholders will vote today on the restructuring of the Irish aviation services scheme, which is, in effect, the airport pension scheme.  This will affect all members of the scheme, including retired, active and deferred members.  We have debated this up and down and I thank colleagues who have been supportive of my position and the pensioners.  I remind Members that pensioners, some of whom are into their 90s, will lose six weeks' pay if the vote is passed at the EGM today.  They will also carry the full risk of the pension scheme into the future and pay a levy of 2.53% per annum on top of that.  Many of the deferred pensioners who have not yet retired will lose up to 60% of their benefits and existing staff will also take a cut.<\/p><p>We have pleaded and debated up and down with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, his predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, on this but all to no avail.  I have tabled amendments to the Social Welfare Bill next week and ask colleagues to look at them very carefully as they could have the effect of reversing some of these measures.  The problem is that this is all being choreographed.  In my view, it is a massive stitch up.  Today, these companies and the Government will write off &euro;500 million just like that with a vote.  The irony is that the only people who will have a vote today are the shareholders of Aer Lingus, not the members of the pension scheme, including those who have retired and those who worked for 30 or 40 years in the companies.  The Government and the Irish people have a stake in Aer Lingus of 25%.  I would like to know what the Government's position will be at the EGM today.  Will the Government vote for the restructuring of a scheme to reduce the benefits for the 15,000 people across these classes of scheme members or will it use the opportunity to oppose the restructuring?<\/p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business for today to provide that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, comes to the House for just 30 minutes before 2 p.m. to answer questions as to how the Government will vote on the restructuring of the pension scheme.  Why I say this is a stitch up is that all of the amendments we tabled - and which the Government was aware of - were ruled out of order in the D&aacute;il.  I have retabled them in the Seanad but, unfortunately, the EGM is today.  Aer Lingus called the EGM the day after the changes to the scheme were passed.  We have one last opportunity to do the right thing here.  Can the Leader confirm how the Government is voting at the EGM this afternoon and respond to my proposal to amend the Order of Business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000003#B00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1418207400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien that everyone will want to express their disgust and horror at the revelations on the \"Prime Time\" programme last night.  While they were flagged in advance and we knew what would be in the programme, watching the scenes on the hidden camera was appalling.  I refer in particular to the humiliation and degradation of residents by staff.  I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien entirely that this was not about resources, but involved experienced staff who had been there for some time.  The treatment by some individuals of the residents of &Aacute;ras Attracta was appalling.  I am glad to see the HSE has apologised unreservedly.  The HSE has already taken action and initiated a series of steps to prevent a recurrence of these unacceptable practices, which is very welcome.  I note the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has welcomed the steps taken by the HSE, in particular the independent investigation it has initiated into the incidents at &Aacute;ras Attracta.  The real concern is that this sort of treatment of residents is happening in other institutions, which is something we will all be deeply concerned about.<\/p><p>I had the opportunity on Monday this week to spend quite some time at Mountjoy men's prison and the D&oacute;chas centre for women.  I visit the prisons on a regular basis.  It is heartening to see the improvements to the conditions for prisoners there, in particular in the men's prison where the appalling practice of slopping out has been discontinued and all cells are single occupancy.  The practice of doubling up has ceased.  At the same time as we are making great improvements in our treatment of prisoners in custody, about which we have been the subject of international criticism for many decades, it is sad to see that we have not, apparently, made the same progress in the treatment of all citizens in institutions in the State.  The &Aacute;ras Attracta  case, like Leas Cross ten years ago, should be a wake-up call for all of us.  I congratulate the team of journalists who brought this to our attention and wish the HSE investigation team well.  I hope we do not see any more of these depressing programmes.  A colleague who has emigrated to Australia texted me this morning to say he despaired of humanity having watched the programme.  We all share that view.<\/p><p>On a more optimistic note, I welcome the acceptance by the Government last night of the motion on recognition for the independent State of Palestine, following the lead of the Seanad.  Recognition of the independent State of Palestine by different EU member states - and there seems to be a growing momentum around this - can only add impetus to efforts to secure peace in the Middle East, in particular between Israel and Palestine.  It is a long-standing Labour Party policy and I am glad to see the Government moving on it.<\/p><p>Last night, I had the privilege to launch at the Mansion House the Dympna Meaney women's leadership development fund for Comhl&aacute;mh, the organisation for returned development workers.  This is a new bursary established for women leaders in the global south, in other words Central and South America, Asia and Africa.  It seeks to empower women by providing them with opportunities to build skills and leadership, thereby empowering communities.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the new year on development strategies and organisations as there is a great deal of good work going on.  We can be very proud of the fact that we send 2,000 volunteers from Ireland overseas every year to work in development.  We do not highlight that enough in the Oireachtas and I would like to see us do so in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000003#B00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1418207400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>\"We must rise up\" said John Dolan in his interview on \"Morning Ireland\" today.  He was not talking about water charges but about the documented casual nature of the abuse at &Aacute;ras Attracta which played out for all to see on RTE last night.  As Professor Gerard Quinn said in his interview, residents were being treated as objects to be managed rather than as subjects to be cherished.<\/p><p>On international human rights day 2014, I have a number of questions for the Leader.  Perhaps some of them are rhetorical in the best sense, but they are questions that need to be asked nonetheless.  On International Human Rights Day 2014, can the Leader confirm that the long-awaited gender recognition legislation will be published before Christmas?  Dr. Lydia Foy, her advocates and all trans people, young and old, in Ireland want to know.<\/p> <p>On International Human Rights Day 2014, will the Leader inform the House as to when the Department of Justice and Equality will publish the last head of the sexual offences (amendment) Bill?  This head has to do with the oppressive, offensive and truly outdated legislation that criminalises sexual relations between people with an intellectual disability if they are not married.  It is the law my right to love Bill - the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 - seeks to change.  Will the Leader confirm that the sexual offences (amendment) Bill that will amend so many oppressive past laws, will be enacted before this Government concludes its work?<\/p><p>On International Human Rights Day 2014, will the Leader also confirm if the Government will put a referendum to the people so they can choose whether they want to incorporate Irish people&rsquo;s fundamental economic, social and cultural rights within our most precious legal document, namely, the Constitution?  Would it not be an incredible way for the Government to demonstrate its will to end long-term, medium-term and short-term homelessness?<\/p><p>On International Human Rights Day 2014, will the Leader give us an indication if the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government will finally recognise the proud identity of our Irish Traveller community by recognising their ethnic identity, or will that community have to wait until the next Government assumes power?  Tomorrow, I am meeting with a group of Travellers who want to speak to me about Seanad reform and if there is any possibility when all is said and done, the talking finished and one more report has been written, that we will get some genuine relevant reform that will be inclusive of their voice, so that one of their people can be in the Seanad to represent how they see the world, experience society and the economy.  If I were offered a place on the Seanad reform group, I would gladly give it to one of the Travellers.  I wonder how that would change the conversation and the recommendations.<\/p><p>I wish a happy International Human Rights Day 2014 to the Leader and Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000003#B00600","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418208000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We are all shocked by last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.

We must consider the importance of this House and ensuring it represents the whole country.  Senator Zappone is quite correct in stating there are areas in which we can make changes.  Whatever happens in Seanad reform, that is one of the changes that should take place.<\/p><p>Another Bill passed comparatively recently amalgamated the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency to form the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  It just issued an extensive report on how customer service is handled.  It was interesting to note how bad we are at it.  A large number of people have been let down in this regard with the estimated cost to consumers coming to &euro;500 million a year.  Will we have an opportunity to consider this report at some point?  It does show that when we pass legislation, it gets things done, whether it is customer service.  Ireland has an opportunity to establish a name for customer service worldwide.<\/p><p>On Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s earlier reference to the pension challenge in Aer Lingus, I hope there is a recognition of the problem we had in Waterford Crystal, which has been resolved in the past several days.  A large number of people have worked all their lives in Aer Lingus.  It is disgraceful a decision may be made today which may take away part of their pensions for which they have worked and contributed to over the years.

It is a blight on our society and it is about basic human dignity.<\/p><p>I recall once going to a hospital to make a will for a woman who was terminally ill with cancer.  Her husband had predeceased her and she had a special needs daughter.  All that troubled that woman was who would care for her daughter.  It was not an issue of money.  It was about who would look after Anna.  This morning other parents in such circumstances must be shaking, asking is this our society in 2014, one that cannot care for those who cannot care for themselves.  It is a sad day for all of us as politicians and society in general.  It puts the great march to be held outside today on Merrion Square into the ha&rsquo;penny place.

Several weeks ago, a young man informed me he was five months waiting to get an NCT.  I thought at the time it was carelessness on his part in failing to apply on time.  My NCT is due at the end of February.  On 1 December, three months before it, I rang up to apply for the test but the earliest date I could get was the middle of March.  I said I would do the test on a Sunday morning or a Saturday night but was told I could not and the situation with appointments was dire.  How many drivers will be faced with getting three points on their licence if their NCT is out of date through no fault of their own?  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the responsible Minister?  It is appalling that anyone who has applied for an NCT can only get a test five months later through no fault of their own.  It does not add up.  More test centres or more manpower must be introduced to deal with this.  Eight years ago, the maximum waiting time for a NCT was six weeks.  Now the delay can be up to four or five months, which is appalling.  These delays are not just one-offs either as they are widespread.  It is not good enough for drivers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000004#C00500","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1418208000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000004#C00600","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1418208000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I second Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000004#C00700","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1418208000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I add my voice in condemning the appalling and disgusting behaviour towards and treatment of residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta.

We were never allowed to call them patients or anything other than residents and they were always treated with dignity and kindness.  No amount of training will teach people care, decency, respect and love.

One of the things the report highlights is the lack of checks and balances.  That is what we need in every system.  It appears not only that the facility is falling down in the provision of services and how it treats the people it is appointed to care for, but also that the checks and balances are not working.  That is a very serious issue.  Why was this not flagged from a medical point of view?  How come it did not show up in the HIQA inspection?  Why are the checks and balances not working?  That is one of the things that a report or an investigation into this matter must identify.  What checks and balances need to be put in place?  I agree with Senator O'Donovan when he speaks about acting as a solicitor.  I have come across some very similar cases.  It is a huge concern.  I came across people who would have looked after their own child for 50 or 60 years and can no longer deal with it.  Their big worry is who will look after that child with a disability once they are gone.  It is a huge concern for parents and it is important that we can give reassurance that there are proper facilities, that all the care they require is there, but also that the checks and balances are there.<\/p><p>I also support Senator O'Donovan's point about the NCT test and the delays.  I too received texts yesterday from Cork, where there is a huge delay in providing inspections and reports.  It is something that must be dealt with.  There is no point in implementing legislation and then finding that people cannot comply with it because the people offering the service to carry out these tests are not able to give that service within a reasonable period.<\/p> <p>I agree with him that this problem needs to be resolved before the legislation is put in place.  Otherwise, it will impose penalties on people who have no control over it which is wrong.  This is something we need to look at.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000005#D00900","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418209200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Like so many of my colleagues here today I want to express my absolute horror at what happened at &Aacute;ras Attracta in County Mayo.  I am shocked, horrified and embarrassed at what I watched on \"Prime Time\" last night.  I commend Paul Maguire and his investigation team from \"Prime Time\" on exposing this most shocking of human rights abuses of elderly and vulnerable people.  I fully expect that legal prosecutions will follow for those staff members who physically assaulted, verbally threatened, punched, dragged, kicked and beat the service users in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  The buck should not stop there.  It is incumbent on State agencies to provide a safe environment for people who need protection over and above the norm.  Last night's programme highlighted the gaping hole in legislation to protect the elderly and most vulnerable in society.  There is no doubt these people require extra protection and we must now act to provide it.<\/p><p>Perpetrators of the kind of abuse that we witnessed on &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night act from a position of control and power because they know full well that the service users in &Aacute;ras Attracta are incapable of climbing into a witness box in a court which means they cannot give evidence about their own maltreatment.  The people who mistreated the residents of &Aacute;ras Attracta know they will never be prosecuted for their actions, omissions and behaviour because there is no third party whistleblower.  It is very clear that we need to immediately move to address this issue.  I propose the establishment of a cross-party emergency committee to examine the treatment of the elderly and vulnerable residents in all homes in Ireland.  We should also discuss increasing penalties for anyone who abuses, hurts or maims the people we should be protecting.  At the very least our vulnerable and elderly are entitled to protection and if we do not then what kind of a democracy are we left with?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000006#E00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1418209200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I hope Senator Higgins is wrong when she says that nobody can be prosecuted as a result of what we saw on television last night.  The people who ill treated the residents and perpetrated the type of crimes we saw last night should face the full rigour of the law.<\/p><p>It is particularly sad that we, as a people, do not seem to have learned from the lessons of Leas Cross and other cases of institutional abuse that we have seen over the years.  Today is international human rights day and I hope that last night's programme will act as a wake-up call for us to ensure what happened in &Aacute;ras Attracta will never be allowed to happen here again.  It is worrying that we cannot give an assurance to people who have vulnerable relatives in various care homes and institutions in this State that such abuse does not happen in other places.  A thorough investigation is required to ensure that proper procedures and proper care is administered.  The programme called into question the management of the &Aacute;ras Attracta facility and its recruitment process needs to be look at as well.  How could the people, who behaved in the way we saw on television last night, have gotten through a recruitment process and be deemed suitable to work in a care institution that looks after the most vulnerable people?<\/p><p>Finally, I wish to comment on the NCT situation that has been raised by Senators O'Donovan and Colm Burke.  There is a simple solution to the problem.  If somebody has applied for an NCT and received written confirmation of a date for a test, however far forward it might be, then it should be deemed evidence that they are in the process of having their NCT carried out and that it is not their fault that the certificate is not on display.  This is an administrative matter which could be simply resolved and thus would avoid people incurring penalty points, as has been outlined in the House.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000006#E00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1418209200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The vast majority of Members who have spoken this morning have spoken on the &Aacute;ras Attracta case which we saw on our television screens last evening.

It appears from the wording that it is the Senator's intention that all those earning the standard annual minimum wage be exempted entirely from liability to pay the universal social charge.  The Senator should be aware that the changes proposed in the Bill include a provision to extend the exemption threshold for the charge from the current &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012 per annum.  This measure alone removes an estimated 80,000 low income earners from the USC net.  These are in addition to the 330,000 individuals removed from the USC net as a result of the extension of the exemption introduced by the Minister in 2012.  It is now estimated that approximately 650,000 people, or 28% of all income earners, will not be liable to pay the charge from next year onwards.  <\/p><p>In addition, as a result of the reduction in the two lower rates of universal social charge and the extension of the threshold at which the 7% rate becomes payable from &euro;16,016 to &euro;17,576, all those earning the minimum wage will see a reduction in the amount they pay under the universal social charge next year.  For instance, as a result of the changes introduced in budget 2015, someone earning &euro;17,542 will see his or her weekly universal social charge of &euro;10.51 per week fall to &euro;7.19 per week.<\/p> <p>This means the person's tax bill will be reduced by a little over 20%.  In fact the new higher threshold was specifically chosen to ensure that those on the standard minimum wage would be exempted from the higher rate of universal social charge.  It should also be noted that an individual on the minimum wage is exempted from paying PRSI.<\/p><p>While I cannot accept the Senator's recommendation I emphasise that budget 2015 and the Finance Bill are merely stepping stones to further reforms, as has already been outlined by the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000008#G00600","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418210700,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Recommendation put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418210700,"counter":84,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418210700,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I move recommendation No. 2:<blockquote><br \/>In page 10, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:&ldquo;(b) in section 531AM(1)(b) to insert the following after paragraph (viii)&mdash;<blockquote>&ldquo;(ix) where an individual is charged to income tax under section 112 in respect of a contribution to a PRSA (within the meaning of Chapter 2A of Part 30) by virtue of section 118(5), the amount of the contribution to the PRSA,&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is widely recognised that pension coverage in Ireland is not at the level that it should be.  Currently there are five workers for every pensioner.  However, by 2050 the ratio will be somewhere in the region of two workers for every pensioner, and this will put considerable stress on the system.  In other words, the system we have now under which workers support people on the State pension will simply not be feasible in 2050.  Perhaps 2050 seems a long way away but we really should plan for it at this stage.<br\/>Recently I read that 900,000 private-sector workers do not have a pension of any description.  We are on the brink of a major pensions crisis and the Government must act.  As a first step it should play a far more proactive role in incentivising people to plan for their future pensions needs.  Incentivising people to take out a personal retirement savings account is one way in which we can seek to avoid a pensions gap.  That gap will get bigger and bigger unless we do something about it.<br\/>The purpose of the recommendation is to ensure employer contributions to PRSAs are not subject to the universal social charge.  That is the objective.  Employer contributions to traditional pensions are not subject to USC, so why should contributions to PRSAs be treated differently?  I do not understand why.  Basically, it is unfair and furthermore the set-up does not achieve what we should be setting out to achieve.<br\/>I am advised that there is strong evidence to show the decline in popularity of PRSAs can be directly linked to the changes introduced in budget 2011, which saw the USC being imposed on employer contributions to PRSAs.

PRSAs are a far more straightforward form of pension.  Since they are personal to the worker, they are highly portable.  This makes them particularly suitable for part-time workers - a large percentage of part-time workers are women - or workers who change jobs frequently and so on.<\/p><p>Initially there was a good take-up of PRSAs.  However, the numbers began to fall off significantly when changes in budget 2011 meant that in stark contrast with the position regarding traditional pensions, employer contributions to PRSAs were subjected to USC.  This meant workers with a PRSA saw the USC make a bigger dent in their take-home pay than a worker holding a more traditional pension - often these higher paid and male workers.  Not only is this fundamentally wrong, it is also discriminatory.  The measure disproportionately impacts on the lower-paid.

The figures presented to me suggest, however, that since the budget measures of 2011 PRSAs have suffered a significant disadvantage in comparison to other pension schemes.  Basically this arises from the fact that the USC is now payable by the pension contributor on the basis of the employer contribution.  It may well be a significant reason for a reduction in the number of people taking on PRSA arrangements.  I am advised that currently there are some 19,200 employer PRSA arrangements and this covers 77,300 employees, a substantial figure.

Many people in Ireland invested in rental property on the basis that it would provide a pension in their old age as a form of asset-based welfare.  The universal social charge is levied on gross income earned on a rental property, although a loss might occur when allowable deductions are made.  A number of people who own rental properties are in negative equity and mortgage arrears and the imposition of the universal social charge on gross income is unfair, particularly when a loss could be made on such a property.  Levying the universal social charge on PRSAs is similarly unfair because we want people to provide for themselves.

The OECD has found that in Ireland only 41.3% of workers, four out of ten, aged between 20 and 69 years are enrolled in a fund pension plan.  We know that the issue of pensions is a time bomb and, as Senator Feargal Quinn said, by 2050 there will only be two workers for every pensioner; therefore, we must plan ahead.  When I was on the other side of the House with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, this was fixed somewhat by increasing the eligibility age for the old age pension to 68 years.  This was an improvement, but the issue is still a time bomb, as is widely accepted.<\/p><p>PRSAs were introduced in 2002, at which stage I was an employer - I had six employees and was obliged to offer PRSAs, but it was up to employees to decide whether they should take up a PRSA.  However, employers complied with their obligations.  As Senator Katherine Zappone said, the great thing about PRSAs is they are personal and portable in that they allow people to make decisions independent of their employers and regardless of whether they are in the public service.  Public servants have access to pensions.  PRSAs allow people to plan for their futures and retirements and we need people to do this.  People are living longer and the least we should do is ensure this measure which incentivises personal pensions is on an equal tax footing with other pensions.<\/p><p>I was gobsmacked to learn that this provision will not achieve equality in this area as employees will be forced to pay USC on the value of employers' contributions to PRSAs.  An employer may be generous and put aside more than is necessary for an employee, but this will see the employee being penalised by paying more in USC and he or she will end up with less money in his or her pocket.  As of budget 2011, this measure is a deterrent to taking up pension schemes and militates against the nation's needs.  It prevents people from planning for the future and turns them off from making such provision as they prefer to wait until later when things get better.<\/p><p>I sold pension products in a former life and one of the most attractive things about them is the contribution is subject to 100% tax relief.

I know that recommendations are tabled in this House, but the concept is the same as amendments and I take them seriously.  It has been useful to hear a wide range of views on this issue.  Senator Feargal Quinn is correct that we must address the issue of pension scheme take-up.  As Senator Aideen Hayden and others said, the demographic profile shows that the population is ageing and the take-up of pension schemes will only become more important as an economic and societal issue.<\/p><p>I am not in a position to accept the recommendation, but I want to highlight the fact that there is a Government commitment to carry out a full review of all State supports for pensions.  There is a window of opportunity to examine this issue and I will take the views of this House into account and ask that the Minister for Finance and the Government do so too when considering the road map to be published on universal pension provision.<\/p><p>I will go through my technical note because it is useful.  The recommendations tabled by Senators Feargal Quinn and Katherine Zappone would, if accepted, provide an exception from USC for employer contributions to personal retirement savings accounts.  It is important to note that the tax treatment of contributions to PRSAs and the contribution and benefit limits that apply differ, in some respects, from the tax treatment and limits applying to occupational pension schemes.  This reflects the fact that they are, essentially, different pension products.<\/p> <p>Occupational pension schemes are sponsored and supported by employers.  However, as Senator Fidelma Healy Eames outlined, the Pensions Act requires that employers that do not provide an occupational pension scheme for their employees offer them a standard PRSA contract.  While there is no obligation on employers to make contributions to the PRSA contract on behalf of employees, they may do so.  It is in the context of employment-related PRSAs that the issue of USC arises.<\/p><p>Employee contributions to occupational pension schemes and PRSAs are relieved from income tax at the employee's marginal income tax rate but, reflecting the broad-based nature of the USC, PRSAs are not subject to relief from USC.  Age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, subject to a maximum annual earning of &euro;115,000, act to limit the amount of tax relief contributions that an individual employee can make towards pension saving in any one year, whether through an occupational pension scheme or a PRSA.  The tax treatment of employer contributions to occupational pension schemes on behalf of employees differs from that for PRSAs.  In the case of an occupational pension scheme, employer contributions do not come within the age- and earning-related restrictions on tax relief for pension contributions mentioned above.  In contrast, employer contributions to PRSAs come within those limits, which is quite an important and technical difference.  This difference in treatment reflects the fact that in the case of occupational pension schemes, the principal control that has applied to limit funding of benefits is the requirement that such schemes cannot produce a fund that exceeds the amount that will provide a maximum pension on retirement to any scheme member of two-thirds of their final salary.  The application of age- and earnings-related restrictions to employer and employee contributions was, therefore, not considered necessary given this benefit limit control.  In the case of PRSAs, however, because they are largely structured as personal pension products, there is no benefit limit as such and benefits are regulated through a contribution-based control.  In other words, the age-related and earning limits apply to the combined employer and employee contributions to a PRSA, which acts to restrict the size of the PRSA tax relief pension fund from which benefits can be funded.  If employer contributions to a PRSA were not brought within these limits, there would be no restriction on the amount that an employer could contribute to an employee's PRSA contract.  To ensure adherence to these contribution limits, the PRSA legislation treats employer contributions on behalf of an employee as a benefit-in-kind of the employee but also deems it to be a contribution made by the employee for tax relief purposes.  This means that where the aggregate amount of employer and employee contributions does not exceed the age- and earnings-related limits already mentioned, no effective benefit-in-kind tax charge will arise.  This is because any benefit-in-kind on the employer contribution in the hands of the employee is exactly matched and offset by the employee's tax relief on the additional deemed employee contribution.  It is only where the combined employer and employee contributions exceed the relevant age- and earning-related limits that an effective benefit-in-kind tax charge will arise.  I put this on the record as it is useful for people who have an active interest in this area.  There is an awful lot of technical detail to take in, but it is important for people to be able to go back and reference this in terms of our debates on pensions.<\/p><p>In contrast, employer contributions to occupational pension schemes on behalf of employees are specifically exempt under tax law from being charged as remuneration of the employees concerned in the form of benefit-in-kind, reflecting the operation of the benefit limit mentioned earlier.  That an employer contribution to a PRSA is subject to benefit-in-kind in the hands of the employee means that it attracts an actual USC charge.  It can be argued that this treatment is consistent with the treatment of employee contributions to occupational pension schemes, which, as already mentioned, are not exempt from USC.  In the case of a PRSA, neither the actual employee contribution nor the deemed employee contribution is USC-exempt.  The USC treatment of employer contributions to PRSAs has been looked at before.  It was examined in 2012 as part of the review of the USC undertaken by the Department of Finance at the instigation of this Government.  This review was published on the Department's website.  Following that review, the Minister decided not to make any change to the USC for employer contributions.  The Minister used the fiscal space available to him and the Government at the time to instead remove 330,000 individuals from liability for USC altogether.  Senators will be aware, as already outlined, that this year's budget fiscal space was used to exempt a further 80,000 individuals from USC and to lower the tax burden for lower and middle income earners. <\/p><p>To allow an exemption from USC in respect of employer contributions to PRSAs would be to breach one of the fundamental features of USC, which is that it applies to a very wide income base.  This could quickly lead to claims for exemptions from the charge from other individuals and groups who would consider themselves equally deserving of special treatment.  For example, it could lead to demands from self-employed contributors to PRSAs for USC relief from their contributions and could conceivably lead to demands for USC relief on contributions to all pension products, including occupational pension schemes.  There is also the risk that it could lead to arrangements between employers and employees, particularly employees who are in a position to influence their remuneration packages, whereby the employer contribution to the PRSA is maximised as part of the employee's overall remuneration package and the employee contribution minimised or eliminated altogether, thus avoiding USC on that effective income.<\/p><p>In view of the issues outlined, and taking everything into consideration, the Minister has decided not to make any changes to the treatment of PRSAs in respect of the USC at this time.  However, as with all taxes, he is keeping the matter under review, and in this regard I note, as I outlined at the beginning of my contribution on this recommendation, the recent Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, which confirmed that during 2015, as part of a priority to deliver better living and working standards, the Government will agree a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new universal supplementary pension saving scheme.  It is envisaged that as part of this work all State supports for private pension provision will be reviewed.  For the above reasons, the Minister cannot accept the recommendation.  I respectfully suggest that there is scope for a detailed debate on the whole issue of pensions.  In the context of the 2015 review of all State supports to pensions, there will be a window of opportunity. <\/p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden raised the general issue of USC.  We have only begun on part one of a three-part tax reform plan.  We have seen changes to the USC.

That the Minister has decided not to make any change &quot;at this time,&quot; in the words of the Minister of State, gives me hope that something will happen.  Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to the fact that maybe it could have been done in the Social Welfare Bill, which, in the past, would have been a social welfare and pensions Bill.

The Minister of State should go back and have a look at it.  In the context of an overall debate on pensions, at 2 p.m. today 15,000 airport pension scheme members will have their benefits savaged due to legislation passed by the Government.  In terms of pension coverage and enticing people into pensions because of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 and the fact that the Government has introduced single insolvencies, I would not advise anyone to go into a pension scheme, although I worked in the pensions area for 15 years.  Private pension schemes are following on the back of what has happened in the Aer Lingus scheme.  One company is now seeking to wind down the Friends First scheme, in which I had 14 years' deferred service, and hive people off into defined contributions.  There is a big issue around pensions which is being made worse by the policies pursued by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and by successive social welfare and pensions Bills.  I agree with Senator Bradford and Senator Quinn that it is a small anomaly and there is no valid reason it should not be rectified.  There is a much greater issue on the pensions front.  Pension provision will decrease as this country is aging.  That is what is happening.  There is no confidence in pensions, not because of fund managers and the administration of schemes but because of some fundamental changes to pension law introduced by the Government.  The Government legislated for the first cut to a private pension scheme in the history of the State with the State Airports Act.<\/p> <p>This means it is open season for everything else.  When we talk about having a discussion on pensions - I see what Senator Hayden is saying - we want to have a serious discussion about it, because at this stage the legs have been taken from under it.  <\/p><p>As I stated earlier PRSAs have not worked as they should have.  Pension coverage is decreasing.  When people do not feel their pensions are secure, they will not take one out.  They were doing what every Government wanted them to do - namely, providing for their retirement.  Now, people will think a second and third time before they do it.  There is an irony here.  Yesterday we spoke of the Waterford Crystal workers.  That involved a double insolvency.  Fair play to them for taking that fight to the European Court of Justice.  They are better off than the pensioners who this afternoon will have their benefits cut.  This is a profitable company, with hundreds of millions of euro of cash on deposit, like Aer Lingus.  It is mad.  We could have a debate, but we would want to be serious about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000011#K00300","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418212500,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I note Senator Quinn's suggestion that we do not press this recommendation, and I always do what he tells me to do.

I listened to the Minister of State's explanation and I look forward to reading it as well to fully get what he is saying.  It is important to have that technical clarification.<\/p><p>I think there is an anomaly here.  Is the Minister of State saying that if the Government were to change this, in theory, folks who take out a PRSA - generally lower-paid and part-time workers - could potentially get more benefit or tax relief than those who have occupational pensions?  Is that the theory?  I wonder if that will ultimately be the case in practice.  The Minister of State's other argument is that if we were to change the USC in this way, having regard to this pension product, we would be on a slippery slope.  What I heard was that we might then need to change the USC rules in relation to other products or in other ways and that we simply could not do that.  I never accept slippery slope arguments, so I am not sure I am willing to accept this one.  However, I need to study the Minister of State's response a little more carefully.

That is a 2012 figure, which, in terms of informing the debate, is useful to have.  What I am ultimately saying to Senator Zappone and to this House is that if we are going to talk about the future of the USC it is important to do it in the round.  One issue, and it is an important issue, is to ask where the USC goes from here, how it is to be applied, what happens in the context of a tax reform plan and how a hole in the public finances arising from any changes made will be plugged.  If we are going to have a debate about pension provision and how we can achieve a greater increase in the pension rate, it is important to do it in the round.  The Government has given a commitment, particularly in relation to pensions, not just to have a discussion.  I am sure Senator O'Brien did not mean it in that manner.  It has committed not just to have a discussion but to put in place a timeline and an implementation plan.  They are the words in the Government statement of priority.  This is the checklist of things we want to get through in advance of the conclusion of this Government's term in 2016.  Therefore, I suggest that we allow that process to get under way.  There is a commitment that this review of State supports to pensions will take place in 2015.  There is a commitment that the Government will look at the idea of a new supplementary pension savings scheme.  I will ensure and commit to this House that the views expressed earnestly by Senators are fed into that process.  It is not my business to interfere in this House, but I would encourage it to avail of opportunities to have an input.

We do not often have an opportunity to have the Minister of State, or his senior Minister, before us to talk about broad taxation policy.  I tabled a matter on the Adjournment perhaps a month or so ago specifically on the USC.  I was fortunate, given the way Adjournment debates generally happen, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, himself came in to respond.  If I recall correctly, the wording of my motion asked the Minister, in view of the fact that the USC had been introduced as an emergency measure with a view to amending or changing it once the emergency had passed, if plans were now being made to dramatically overhaul - I hate to use the word abolish - the USC.<\/p><p>In light of what has been said since by other Ministers and the Taoiseach in the broader political establishment, the more I think back to the Minister's reply that night, the more surprised I am.  He made it abundantly clear that as far as he was concerned it was never an emergency tax proposal.  He pointed out what I know myself - that it was designed to replace the health insurance levy and the youth employment levy but, as far as he was concerned, once it was introduced by the previous Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, it was a permanent part of the architecture of taxation policy in this country and he had no proposals whatsoever to change it.<\/p><p>I do recognise that the USC is bringing in approximately, give or take, a few hundred million.  It is bringing in approximately &euro;4 billion.  It is not possible to simply wish it away and hope life will go on.  However, I hope it will become the subject of a serious debate in the wider context of national taxation policy.  What I stated to the Minister for Finance that night was that, notwithstanding the myriad of commissions on taxation down through the years, we really need to put in place a commission to look at how the State is now being funded.  The USC is a heavy penalty on working people.  I appreciate the measures taken in the budget, but the Minister of State will also appreciate that the USC is taking money out of every worker's pocket every day of the week, as are income tax, PRSI and VAT.  One hears the phrase, &quot;the hated USC&quot;.  It is just another tax.  <\/p><p>We need to look at our broader taxation system and a broader way of generating income for the coffers of the State.  VAT, income tax, PRSI and other charges must be on the menu as well as the USC.  The Minister for Finance made it clear to me in this House that as far as he was concerned there was no intention to review or overhaul the USC.  Perhaps political matters take over from financial matters on occasion.  There seems to be a slightly different Government narrative now.  There were the budget improvements, but we hear mutterings that over the next 12 months the USC will be further amended.  I ask the Minister of State what is current Government policy.  He stated the Government's taxation intent in the short term.  I am not making an overtly political point, but it appears to me now that there are three offerings on the menu of Government proposals.  There is official Government tax policy as enunciated on budget day, with a sort of rolling two- to three-year plan, with the famous phrase from the Taoiseach, &quot;if the Government is re-elected&quot;.  That appears to be Government policy.  There is also Fine Gael policy.  There is also, as there should be, a slightly different Labour Party policy.  Over the course of the past month, we have heard three variations on the theme.  There is the official Government policy, with the Government saying what it will do if re-elected, something that is unprecedented from a political perspective.<\/p> <p>It made me wonder what was the purpose of the Labour Party because the Taoiseach announced what the Government would do if it was re-elected and what would happen in the budgets of 2018, 2019 and beyond.  Now we are getting a Fine Gael perspective, and why not, and we are getting the Labour Party perspective.  Which of the three perspectives will the Minister reflect on over the next 12 months?<\/p><p>Let us return to the USC.  I am realistic enough to know that a charge of &euro;4 billion cannot disappear.  I am also realistic enough to know that the USC replaced two other levies that brought in substantial funding.  The charge did not arise as an additional &euro;4 billion of taxation.  I appreciate that the charge is a burden on workers but so are myriad other taxes.<\/p><p>There is a debate on whether Ireland is taxed heavily or lightly and there are all sorts of statistics to support either side.  The fact of the matter is that too many citizens pay a huge proportion of their income through all sorts of taxes and charges.  Let me outline the other side of the equation.  The State appears to be very good at taxing people, introducing new charges and anomalies and blocking reliefs but it is not as effective at ensuring taxes are well spent.  Everyone knows the phrase &quot;Government spending&quot; and people want more Government spending.  There is no such thing as Government spending; it is the spending of taxpayers' money.  If we could concentrate on waste and insist on proper spending of taxpayers' money then we would do the State a significant service.  <\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for showing latitude.  This section deals with USC.  I am in the fortunate position that the Minister for Finance put his views on the record of the House.  He clearly outlined that as far as he was concerned the USC was not an emergency tax measure but a significant part of the State's taxation architecture which will not be changed.  However, that argument seems to have developed in a meandering fashion, politically.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State for his own reflections on the USC and the current taxation system.  Does he agree with my suggestion that, in the calm light of day, we need a type of commissioner on taxation to look at all of these measures?  Can they be looked at in the following context?  Do the measures provide men and women with an incentive to go to work and stay at work?  Do the measures provide an incentive to the employer?  I was surprised to hear my colleague, Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, was once an employer of six people.  Do the measures act as an incentive to employers to consider employing somebody else?  Does it put work at the top of the list of aspirational hopes?  All of these issues need to become part of an urgent political debate.  <\/p><p>We must concede, and for once I agree with a comment made by Bob Geldof.  A few weeks ago I watched a television interview with him in which he made an interesting comment on taxation.  He said it is probably impossible to have a proper economic cycle because political cycles are too short.  Politicians, and we are all politicians, plan for the next election so it is difficult to plan for the next economic cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000012#L00600","speaker":"1189","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":107,"content":"<p>There is no electoral cycle in North Korea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000013#M00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Senator Bradford is concluding and I ask Senator Darragh O'Brien not to interrupt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000013#M00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I advise Senator Darragh O'Brien that there are Members of both Houses and of one political party who could advise us of how things work in North Korea and they are not in Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000013#M00400","speaker":"1189"},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I remind the Senator that we are on Committee Stage and that Second Stage is well gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000013#M00500","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I would like to hear the Minister of State's observations on USC.

Is USC now standard policy?  Have we moved from the situation where it was introduced as an emergency measure during the crisis and where every citizen was asked to make a contribution?<\/p><p>In principle, I agree that every citizen should make a contribution according to their ability to pay.  I had a constituency office in Galway city and a lot of people came to it who were totally social welfare dependent.  There was a cycle of social welfare anxiety and depression.  Some people were on disability allowance.  There was a mix of social welfare.  These people got extremely anxious before budgets because they felt they had no control over their lot.  I thought to myself that we need to find a way to enable such people.  It was my view at the time that even if they made a contribution of &euro;1 per week they would have felt they had more of a contract with the State.  I know I have opened a new can of worms with this issue.  Currently, social welfare as a contribution is not considered income and, therefore, is not taxed which is a whole other ball game.  There might be more well-being benefits to it than we think.<\/p><p>Let me return to the issue of USC.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether we have moved from USC being an emergency measure to standard policy?  Can he clarify how much revenue is collected from USC compared with the two levies?  <\/p><p>We are recovering but we have not made a full recovery because there is still a gap of &euro;5 billion annually in the deficit.  I am sure that sum is less now that the Department has taken in &euro;1.7 billion extra in the last quarter.  Is the Minister of State planning to move back to the previous figures of just taking in, through the USC, the sum generated by the two levies?  <\/p><p>Public confidence is eroded when a small charge is introduced that then begins to grow.  It is the thin edge of the wedge argument.  That is exactly why people are outside marching about water charges today.  They are outside because nobody believes, come 2019, that water charges will be available to my home, of more than one person in a family, at &euro;160 net.  If the Government could prove that will be the case, and I asked the same question before as the Leader will confirm, then the water charges argument would dissipate.  <\/p><p>As I have said on a few occasions in this House, Ireland is uncompetitive as a tax nation.  Our top tax rate of 41% starts at &euro;32,800 but its equivalent in France starts at &euro;70,000 and in Germany it starts at &euro;245,000.  Ireland's capital gains tax rate for enterprise is appalling at 33% and does not act as an incentive to invest here.  Ireland's USC cripples people on low wages.  I am not saying people on low wages should not contribute something.  Agency workers who earn &euro;10 an hour have told me that the USC improvements, due to commence on 1 January, will result in a gain of &euro;3 per week.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000013#M00800","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":114,"content":"<p>We are on section 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000013#M00900","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I am discussing section 2 which deals with the USC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000013#M01000","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1418213100,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The Senator is making a Second Stage speech and I warned people about doing so at the start.

While I differ with Senator Bradford on his political commentary, as I am sure he will appreciate, I agree with much of his analysis of the burden of income tax.  The greatest concern of the people I meet in my clinic and as I go about my daily life is not the name of a tax or the composition of the overall tax burden but the cumulative effect of taxes on their pockets.  While I am sure we can and will have debates about how best to reduce the tax burden, the people I meet ask me to get on with reducing it.  While I do not claim the budget is anything other than modest, as has been pointed out, the Government has, for the first time, begun to reduce the tax burden.  We have a long distance to go in this regard.<\/p><p>Senators Bradford and Healy Eames have provided me with an opportunity to outline my views on what should be done with regard to the tax burden.  I recently met a part-time worker in a factory in Gorey who told me that when his boss asks him to work a few extra hours overtime, it immediately pushes his earnings into the higher rate of tax.  Another guy in the same factory told me there was no point working additional hours because the Government takes more than 50% of all income above the threshold for the marginal rate of tax.  We have, by any measure, a progressive income tax system.  That is not my conclusion but the conclusion of a number of reports that one could line up.  The income tax system taxes the wealthy.  I am genuinely worried that the definition of &quot;wealthy&quot; that has appeared in political discourse in recent weeks and months has changed to apply to garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and people working in small businesses.  The mantra &quot;Tax the Rich&quot; sounds great and everyone can agree with it, especially when it is written on a placard.  However, people need to define what they mean by the term &quot;wealthy&quot; because I do not consider a nurse married to a garda to be a wealthy couple.  They are members of middle Ireland or the squeezed middle.  The Government, in the budget, defines the squeezed middle as those who are earning between &euro;30,000 and &euro;70,000.  Those are the rough parameters for the squeezed middle, the people who work to make ends meet. <\/p><p>Recognising that not everyone falls within this category, we have also looked at those who earn less than &euro;30,000 and focused cuts in the universal social charge on this group.  We cut the two lower rates of USC, thereby removing another 80,000 people from the USC net.  Will the universal social charge be in place forever?  I do not know the answer to that question, nor does anyone expect me to know it.  Do I believe it should apply forever?  My priority and focus are on reducing the tax burden and the composition of that burden does not keep me awake at night. <\/p><p>I will make one point in favour of the modality of the universal social charge.  Senator Healy Eames enunciated a similar point in a manner with which I agree.  There is merit in everyone in society making a contribution.  While USC rates are extremely high and a major burden, the benefit of this type of tax is that it does not hit only the usual suspects in the tax system.  I do not have to hand the figures Senator Healy Eames requested on the health and income levies but I will revert to her with the relevant information.  <\/p><p>It must be recognised that the tax burden on workers was reduced in the budget.  Every worker who pays income tax, the universal social charge or both has had the tax burden reduced.  Have we done enough?  The answer is &quot;No&quot; but we have done all we could manage and we will do more.  There is no difference in the Government.

A detailed distribution analysis was published by the Department of Finance in sections B1 to B26, inclusive, of this year's budget book.  The analysis sets out the distributional impact of certain tax and welfare measures over a range of 13 income levels across six family types.  The distributional analysis is complemented by a number of illustrative hypothetical case study families.<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection will also publish a social impact assessment of budget 2015 using the ESRI SWITCH model.  It is expected that this assessment will be published in early 2015.  It will be informed by the additional measures adopted by the Government in respect of the introduction of charging for water services.  The social impact assessment will examine the effect of the budget across family types, income groups and economic status, and report on poverty indicators. <\/p><p>Current models and data sources available to the Government do not permit an analysis of gender, marital status or disability.  However, the Senator may be aware that research published by the ESRI indicates that budgets 2009 to 2013, inclusive, did not have a significant differential impact on people on the basis of gender.  This is not to say that women or men were not negatively impacted by these budgets.  Rather, it implies that these impacts were not materially different based on gender.  This conclusion reflects the fact that the tax and social welfare systems do not discriminate based on gender. <\/p><p>The Senator may also be aware of the recent amendment to a Private Members' motion that was passed in the D&aacute;il on 26 November.  The amendment provides for the undertaking of social impact assessments by cross-departmental bodies composed of the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection before the publication of budgets in future.  Given this undertaking, which I hope the House will welcome, as well as the social impact assessments that the Department of Social Protection typically publishes in the months following the budget, the Minister for Finance does not propose to accept this recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000014#N00700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418214300,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418214300,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I move recommendation No. 4:<blockquote><br \/>In page 11, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;3. <\/b>The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on options for an Income Tax Relief for Graduate Entry Medicine Loan Products.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>I table this recommendation to draw the attention of the Minister of State to it and see how the scheme may be accommodated.

This is an important matter that was raised with many Members in advance of the budget.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, considered the proposal for the introduction of a tax relief for graduate entry medicine loans in the context of the recent budget.  He decided at this time that the tax system is not the appropriate way to address the affordability of graduate entry medical programmes.  The affordability and funding of undergraduate medical education is, in the first instance, a matter for the Department of Education and Skills, having due regard to the needs and requirements of the health system for medical practitioners.  The current focus of the Department of Health in respect of the recruitment and retention of medical practitioners is on the implementation of the recommendations of the strategic review of medical training and career structure, completed earlier this year.  The strategic review report addresses a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system and offers solutions and recommendations that will enable the State to build a sustainable medical workforce for the future.  For those availing of a graduate entry medical programme, tax relief is available for tuition fees incurred on the programme up to a maximum of &euro;7,000 per year.<\/p><p>Tax relief, no matter how worthwhile, reduces the tax base and makes general reform of the tax system more difficult.

It was the usual populist poppycock.  It referred to taxing the wealthy and said Fine Gael and the Labour Party were giving tax relief to the wealthy.  It comes back to the reply of the Minister of State.  People on the higher end of the lower income tax bracket, at &euro;33,800, are classified as wealthy.  This includes garda&iacute;, nurses and public servants.  As far as Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned, these people are wealthy.  We make no apology for assisting and reducing income tax for people at that level.  I have heard from graduates abroad who want to come back to Ireland but ask what is the point in coming back when they will pay the top rate of tax at &euro;32,800, as was the case before the budget.  Thankfully, as a result of the measures in this Finance Bill, this has been increased to &euro;33,800.  I hope there will be a progression in future budgets so that we will see it raised a lot more before people pay the higher rate of tax.  The Minister of State pointed out that young people and others want the tax burden reduced and they want the extra few bob in their pocket.  Whether this refers to the universal social charge or income tax, they do not care how it is achieved as long as they get the extra few bob in their pockets.<\/p><p>People must get into their minds that, on the whole point of taxing the wealthy, Sinn F&eacute;in in particular believes that people who pay tax at the top rate - those who earn more than &euro;33,800 - are the wealthy.  These are the people Sinn F&eacute;in will go after in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000015#O00900","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1418214300,"counter":135,"content":"<p>There is a good deal of agreement on the section, and I agree with the Minister of State about the tax burden.  People are concerned about the amount of money left in their pockets to pay their bills and meet family commitments.  At the current cut-off point of &euro;32,800, the top rate of tax is stultifying and crippling.  The Leader said we were moving to a cut-off point of &euro;33,800, which is a modest increase.  This needs to be raised substantially.  I accept that the top rate of 41% will drop to 40%, but adding on USC and PRSI means it works out at 52% or 53%, which is huge.<\/p><p>We should also be thinking of our greatest human resource, our young graduates, whom we are losing.  What will we offer them to bring them back?  We should offer them attractive tax rates.  France is known for its redistribution of tax, and there, the top rate does not kick in until &euro;70,000.  In the UK, the top rate applies at the equivalent of &euro;150,000, and in Germany, the country that is running us all and that owes us for saving the entire European banking system, it does not kick in until &euro;225,000.  Who is having this debate with the Germans and the French?  We have full control of our fiscal policy, but at the same time, this is the price we are paying for the recovery and for salvaging the entire European banking system.  We are paying it in our punitive tax rates.<\/p><p>The Houses of the Oireachtas have not yet passed the Finance Bill, and the measures in the 2015 budget are not yet in law.  I was a Member on the Government side and I have a difficulty with the fact that the Government is talking about lower taxes.  If the Government is serious about it, let us have a mini-budget in the spring and bring in lower taxes.  If we can put more money into people's pockets, we will improve the economy up and down the country.  We must be on the right side of the curve for me to ask for that, because there is an important tipping point.<\/p> <p>In the last quarter the Government took in &euro;1.7 billion extra that the Minister did not expect to receive.  I am not talking about a giveaway, with which I would not agree, as I do not agree with auction politics, but I do agree with helping the people of the nation to get a little confidence back in order that they would be able to say, \"We paid the price, now the Government of this country is coming with us.  They understand the price we paid.\"  <\/p><p>I am sticking to the point on income tax.  Recently I spoke to two young entrepreneurs who told me that the effective tax rate was about 45%.  The Minister of State might clarify the figure.  They said that, as entrepreneurs, the employer's rate of PRSI was bad and that capitals gains tax rate was completely unacceptable.  One of them, a young software entrepreneur businesswoman who was in Leinster House to meet me and others, said that if she was to sell her business, she would move to the North of Ireland to reinvest.  She would not reinvest here if she had to pay at a rate of 33%.  On top of this, the effective tax rate on her income was 45% or almost half of her income.  We must consider employers on whom we are relying to hire people to give them back hope, attract back graduates, keep money in the country and grow the economy.  I would like the Minister of State to give a timeframe to show that the Government is really serious about reducing these taxes, particularly the top rate of rate, about which he was talking.  Is there any will in the Government to bring forward a mini-budget?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000015#O01000","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418214900,"counter":137,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000016#P00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418214900,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We have had mini-budgets before.

we are keeping him busy today.  In simplistic terms, pension schemes are generally established under trust, and the rules governing pension schemes can vary depending on the rules of the trust, but for them to be Revenue-approved schemes they must comply with certain conditions.  One such fundamental condition is that membership of an occupational scheme must be confined to remunerated employees of the employers participating in that scheme.  That is understandable, but employees in this context, including former employees as pensioners or employees with deferred pension entitlements, are also considered members of a scheme.  It is not possible to pay contributions into a pension fund in respect of which one is not an active member - for instance, a current contributing member - and under the guidelines of the Revenue Commissioners, if this were to happen for any reason, tax relief would not be available on those contributions.<br\/>This particular issue arises from the implementation of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  That Act conveyed pensionable rights on fixed-term workers in universities who hitherto did not have an entitlement to join university pension schemes, and although the fixed-term work Act was enacted in 2003, due to the complexities involved it was not implemented in the sector until 2008.  The entitlement, however, applies effective from the date of implementation of the Act - that is, 2003.  Individuals in question can retrospectively acquire that pensionable service for the period 2003 to 2008 by making the necessary contributions that should or would have been made at the time they were admitted to the pension schemes.  It sounds very involved, but it is understandable when one gets down to it.<br\/>In general, this is straightforward.  If the individuals in question are still employed by the university or in the wider public sector generally, with the same employer, and effectively the same pension scheme, the retrospective contributions can be made through the regular channels and tax relief is applied on those contributions as normal.  However, if an individual has left the Irish public sector it becomes more complicated, as he or she is no longer employed by the Irish State, and therefore the Revenue Commissioners are now allowing tax relief on the contributions as they are being made to an occupational pension scheme in respect of which they are not currently members or active employees.<br\/>There is an additional issue in respect of the timeframe for claiming relief, which is limited to four years after the tax break in question.  If the retrospective contributions were paid in 2008 or 2009, even if the issue of employment and payment to the scheme is addressed, they would now fall outside the timeframe until tax legislation is introduced under which a claim for relief could be made.  I can understand how it happened, but I do not believe it was proposed.<br\/>The proposed recommendation to the Finance Bill is aimed at addressing that anomaly - we are talking about anomalies again on this occasion - to allow individuals who have left the public sector to obtain tax relief on the retrospective element of payment of contributions in respect of the period back to 2003, even where the payments were made longer than four years ago and therefore outside the time limit for claiming relief.  This appears reasonable given that the payment of contributions is in respect of a period when the individuals were in employment, and had they been paid at the time they would have qualified for tax relief.<br\/>The potential cost to the Exchequer from this is likely to be small, as there is a limited cohort involved, and it appears that the only known cases in which this issue has arisen to date are in NUIG.  That is not to say there may not be other cases in other universities, hence the proposal to broaden its application to other universities.  The Minister can see that the recommendation lists practically all of the universities, because we do not know how many other instances may have occurred.  However, we know of some in NUIG, and the reason we have included all the others in the list is simply to cover them.  It is a very small cost to the Exchequer and we believe it is worthy of consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000018#S00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1418215800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>In this recommendation, Senators Quinn and Zappone are seeking to extend the amendments made in section 19 of the Finance Bill relating to the National University of Ireland Galway to the broader university sector.  However, the motivation behind such a wide-ranging extension of this provision is not clear to me.<\/p><p>It is important to appreciate that the purpose of the amendments made in respect of NUIG was to address a very specific issue that had been brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners regarding certain fixed-term contract employees and former employees of that university.  This issue arose from the fact that NUIG only implemented certain pension-related requirements of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 on 1 July 2008 while it clarified issues around the funding of pension benefits for its fixed-term contract employees.  It was only from that date that it began deducting pension contributions from these employees.<\/p> <p>This delay, coupled with legislative restrictions on the timing of pension contributions for tax relief purposes, resulted in former and current NUIG fixed-term employees who were employed by that body during the period from 14 July 2003 to 30 June 2008 being unable to obtain the tax relief they would otherwise have been entitled to had they been in a position to make pension contributions to the relevant NUIG retirement scheme in the years 2003 to 2008.  In light of the difficulties encountered by these employees and former employees, the amendments made by the Minister allow them to obtain tax relief in the tax years 2003 to 2008 for pension contributions made or to be made to the applicable NUIG retirement scheme in respect of those years.<\/p><p>In considering this amendment, the Revenue Commissioners made inquiries to try to establish if fixed-term contract employees in other institutions had been similarly affected due to delays in the implementation of the protection of employees legislation by their employers.  To date, the Revenue Commissioners have no evidence to suggest that there are other similar cases.  In the absence of such evidence, the Senator will understand why the Minister for Finance does not believe we should accept the recommendation suggested.  I understand what the Senator was trying to do, but we do not believe it is necessary.  However, the Minister for Finance wishes to assure the Senators that should it emerge that comparable issues have affected fixed-term contract employees and former employees of any of the other institutions listed in the recommendation, they can and will be dealt with in due course.<\/p><p>On the basis of the foregoing, I cannot accept the recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000018#S00500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418216400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I understand the point the Minister makes, although it appears to be quite complicated.

However, section 54 provides that these shops can be open from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. on any other day.  Bookies' shops should not be open on Sundays after 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., which has always been the practice.  It should not be increased until 10 p.m. on Sundays.

It is extraordinary to have a betting shop open at 7 a.m.  I am thinking of the staff but also of the effect on the punter who is likely to be part of a family.  If the punter has children he or she should be getting out for school in the morning, I would hate to think that he or she would be in a betting shop at 7 a.m.  I am strongly thinking of the effects on society.  That is a 15 hour day.  Let us call a spade a spade, we have all enjoyed a dabble in bookies' shops, myself included.  Some members of our families may have done it more than others.  It is an addictive habit and once one is in there, it is hard to get out.  The next race will always be better.<\/p><p>We must have controls here and the way to do it is to avoid considering online and physical premises on the street in the same way in terms of tax incentives.  That is a tax debate.  It has been said to me that the business that opens onto the street pays rent, rates and keeps our cities, towns and rural areas alive.  They should be incentivised in a different way for that contribution to society, perhaps through lower VAT rates.  Online business can work off a computer out of a back room.  I am not just talking about betting shops versus online but rather all online businesses versus businesses that open onto the street.  It is has been said to me by owners of sports shops.  Anyone coming in to buy sports gear in Galway will come into the shop with the online price and ask the shop to beat it.  It is difficult to beat it all the time.  We need vibrant towns and a sense of business, which is why there should be some reward for businesses that pay rent and rates.  The VAT system is one way to look at that.  The Government did it really well with the tourism industry by moving it down to 9%.  A similar VAT rate should apply for businesses that open onto the streets.<\/p><p>To go back to the section, the hours proposed are too long.  They are too early and too late.  I appreciate that we are dealing with a global community.  If my horse is running in Melbourne, I might need the shop to be open at 7 a.m. to beat the time difference.  However, it is going a bit too far.  One can bet the night before for the horse the next morning.

While I understand Senator Cummins's concerns in this regard, shops do not have to open between those times.

I recognise this as the reality, but this section merely extends the opening hours of registered bookmakers' premises from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. all year round, subject to closure on Good Friday and Christmas Day.  It also provides for penalties where opening hours are contravened.  The aforementioned provisions are already contained in the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 which, as Senators are aware, is before the House.  However, that Bill has stalled somewhat owing to issues raised by the European Commission under the technical standards directive and will not be enacted before the end of the year.  It is necessary, therefore, to provide for the extended opening hours in this Bill to provide certainty for the bookmaking industry which estimates that the existing restricted opening hours from September to March result in the loss of 500 seasonal jobs annually.  I know that the Irish Bookmakers Association has spoken out on the importance of this extension in levelling the playing field with remote operators.  These opening hours already apply from April to August and I do not think anyone is suggesting bookmakers' shops actually open at 7 a.m. between those months.  The provision merely provides for flexibility.  I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn that it is a case of the State staying out of things and not being overly prescriptive.  I believe passionately that there are massive societal issues around gambling, but this section of the Finance Bill will only enact what is to be done under the Betting (Amendment) Bill which has stalled.  These opening hours already apply for a certain part of the year, although I note the concerns of Senator Maurice Cummins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000021#V00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>They do not apply on a Sunday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000021#V00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>They can open all week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., April to August.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000021#V00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>But not on a Sunday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000021#V00500","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1418217600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I apologise; my point is that for a certain period of the year, the opening hours are from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., from April to August, including Sundays.

Society matters and sometimes we must say, &quot;Stop.&quot;  Many gamblers will have the opportunity to bet online at home, but opening for extended hours, with people smoking outside in the morning and late at night, suggests it is all perfectly acceptable.  We must be cognisant of the impact on society, families and individuals because with this measure we are embedding the gambling habit culturally.

The section inserts a new section, section 108(C), into the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 which, as she correctly said, deals with joint and several liability for tax.  The new power and section are an anti-fraud mechanism.  They will allow the Revenue Commissioners to hold a person jointly and severally liable for VAT which has not been remitted to it where the person knowingly or recklessly participates in transactions connected to the fraudulent evasion of VAT.  The section applies to taxable supplies of goods or services and also to the intra-community acquisition of goods.  It provides that anyone made jointly and severally liable will be liable for the net amount of VAT due.  A person made jointly and severally liable under this section will also be liable to pay interest on the outstanding amount of the tax, but will not be subject to penalties.<\/p><p>It is possible to assign joint and several liability for the unpaid tax to more than one accountable person where there are participants in a chain of transactions involving the same supplies.  Legitimate businesses which practise good corporate governance have nothing to fear from this provision.  VAT fraud is an abuse of the VAT system which ultimately results in the fraudulent extraction of VAT from the Exchequer and can involve any type of goods or services.  The Revenue Commissioners has uncovered a number of instances of VAT fraud and as a result issued a notice in July 2014 to raise traders' awareness of the risks and consequences of participating in transactions connected to a VAT fraud.  The notice provided guidelines to help traders protect themselves from becoming involved in VAT fraud and outlined the possible consequences.  These include the imposition of an additional VAT liability on intra-community supplies, the imposition of penalties and the loss of the right to an input credit on their purchases.<\/p><p>Powers to address VAT evasion are vital to assist legitimate businesses which have to compete with less scrupulous businesses.  It is expected that this provision will act as a deterrent to participation in fraud.  Such powers should improve compliance, optimise the tax pay to the Exchequer and also encourage people to be prudent in how they conduct their business.  In terms of the rationale behind the section, it is an anti-fraud measure which has been sought by Revenue and it is prudent to insert it in the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000022#W00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418218200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I did not hear what the Minister of State said about what is possible.

It is one of the recommendations of the agri taxation review intended to encourage more productive use of farm land.<\/p><p>The section inserts a new section, section 81(D), in the Stamp Duties Consolation Act 1999.

The leasee must be a farmer who has a farming qualification or a farmer who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming.  The amendment allows the leasee farmer a period of up to four years to acquire a farming qualification.  <\/p><p>The section also provides for the clawback of the relief if the conditions on which the relief is granted are not satisfied, thus ensuring that only genuine farmers benefit from the relief.  The section also provides that in the event that the conditions of the relief are not fulfilled for the first six years of a lease, the stamp duty that would have been chargeable on the grant of the lease becomes payable with interest.  Failure to fulfil the conditions of the relief due to the death or incapacity of the leasee or by reason of mental or physical infirmity to continue to carry on farming will not give rise to the assessment. <\/p><p>I am informed that issues have been raised about this provision from a State aid viewpoint as the proposed relief is confined to farm land.

There are many circumstances in which parents continue to provide support and maintenance to children who are over 18 and not in full-time education.  Are we going to see 18 year olds being liable for capital acquisitions tax for the bed and board they receive in their homes?  In the current economic climate there is no shortage of instances where children remain living with their parents long after they reach adulthood.  The affordability of rental accommodation has not helped and the Central Bank proposal for 20% mortgage deposits will hardly help either.  During the recession we heard of many instances where parents helped out their children by paying for their groceries or helping with their mortgages.  Under the Minister's proposal, these hard-hit families would be burdened with a bill for capital acquisitions tax.<\/p><p>What is being imposed by the Minister in section 81 is a very blunt instrument.  I urge him to think again.  My recommendation would reinstate the existing terms of section 82 of the 2003 Act and it also seeks to update the law by building in recognition of children of civil partnerships, which was not included in that legislation.

There are issues of revenue reporting and abuse of the system that section 81 purports to address.  Some of the examples of the abuse that have been supplied to me include an exemption where a wealthy individual gifted a house worth &euro;400,000 to an adult child, an exemption claimed in respect of &euro;90,000 of a cash gift to an adult child to purchase a car and furnish and maintain a house, and a taxpayer given free use of a credit card worth &euro;150,000 a year.<\/p><p>These examples relate to extremely wealthy and high earning individuals yet what we would call middle income earners and the children of middle income earners are included in the same category of abusers.  I fail to see how having the threshold set at &euro;3,000, and &euro;225,000 for a lifetime, adequately addresses this issue.  In my opinion, the threshold is set way too low.  It captures middle income earners and, given the increase in property values over the past 12 months, most people would now be caught within the thresholds.  There is also the fact it is a self-assessment process and that Revenue cannot tell us how much money this proposal will raise in any year.

If we think about it, the capital acquisitions tax exemption would apply unless someone was under 25 and in full-time education, which is very restrictive.  Arguably, people who are under 25 and not in full-time education, and who are perhaps unemployed, could be at risk of poverty without this family support.  At the moment approximately 12% of our young people are leaving school early and not completing the leaving certificate.  Quite a number of young people are dropping out of college early and making poor choices, and they may come back again.  If they are not in full-time education, they are definitely going to need help, and some of those will be past the age of 25.  Therefore, this could actually be a poverty trap.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is looking at me in a bemused way, so perhaps I am reading it wrong, which I will accept.  Senator Quinn referred to bed and board.  Could that be considered, for the sake of this measure, a capital acquisition gift?

However, I do not believe we can build a tax system on extreme cases which are, I am sure, dwarfed by the overwhelming number of legitimate instances of parents helping out their children.<\/p><p>It seems to be fundamentally a badly thought out proposal which lacks proportionality.

I am advised that children of civil partners are covered in the same way as all other children.<\/p><p>A tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 applies to exemption from capital acquisitions tax for lifetime gifts or inheritance up to this value in respect of a transfer from a parent to a child.  In addition, there is a small gifts exemption of &euro;3,000, and each parent can gift this amount.  Therefore, the provision only kicks in after a child has received &euro;225,000 free, with no tax paid from the parents, in a lifetime.  This is reasonable in a time of scarce resources.  I accept that the limit may be too low, and this is something that may need to be examined.  The Minister for Finance has said he will keep it under review.  The limits are applied to a sum of &euro;225,000 tax-free and &euro;3,000 per year free.  If a parent wishes to give a gift of more than &euro;3,000, he or she can do so.  Not one cent of the tax kicks in until a person has received &euro;225,000 in value.  The limit is &euro;3,000 per year, but there is no tax in any year until the cumulative value of &euro;225,000 has been exceeded.<\/p><p>There is a useful example for comparison.  We have had conversations about wealth and tax systems and so on.  Let us compare this tax treatment with that of a single person earning an industrial wage of, say, &euro;43,000 per year.  Such an individual would pay &euro;11,400 in income tax, PRSI, and USC each year.  By the time such an individual had earned &euro;225,000, he or she would have paid over &euro;59,000 in income tax, PRSI and USC.  Therefore, an average worker in the State earning &euro;43,000 would have paid &euro;59,000 worth of tax at the point at which a recipient adult child would still have paid zero up to the level of &euro;225,000.  We will keep the arrangement under review in case it has unintended consequences, but I do not believe it will.<\/p><p>The issue of bed and board was raised.  The Revenue Commissioners has stated clearly in the public domain in recent weeks that it does not intend to impute a notional monetary value to bed and board or the value that might be attributable to other such normal informal family arrangements in respect of adult children who continue to reside with their parents, regardless of age.  The Revenue Commissioners will not be knocking on doors collaring people who are 26 years of age and asking how much the bed upstairs is worth per year.  That will not arise; the Revenue Commissioners have made that much clear.  The approach of the Revenue Commissioners is to recognise that it is impractical to put a value on such an arrangement.  I seriously understand the concerns that have been expressed by people earnestly and with good reason in this House and the other House and I hope I can allay those fears.<\/p><p>We had an extensive debate in the other House on property prices, and Senator Gilroy raised the matter in this House.  It relates to the question of whether, given current property prices, the &euro;225,000 threshold is now too low a limit, since in certain parts of the country house prices have risen a good deal.  The Minister for Finance has said that the limit will be kept under review.  However, this should be kept separate from the principle of what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to ensure scare resources are used appropriately and that supports are provided for adult parents looking after their children such that no notional value is attached to bed and board, but we do not want to allow people to abuse this.  Some of the examples read out by Senator Gilroy and provided by the Revenue Commissioners sound so extreme that people in the Houses may end up scratching their heads and wondering whether much of this goes on.  The information from the Revenue Commissioners is that this is going on and there is a good deal of it.  Indeed, it is going on to such an extent that representatives from the Revenue Commissioners have asked the Government to consider it in the context of the Finance Bill, and that is what we are trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000023#X01100","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418219400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I am not as concerned as others, and I figure the Revenue Commissioners will be pragmatic about this matter.

If the expression was \"under 25 years or in full-time education\" it would give a little more room.  Let us build on Senator Quinn's point.  Not everyone is ready for college after they complete the leaving certificate.  Some wait until they are mature students and some have a ten-year turnaround.  In such cases it may be difficult to give a gift.  The property or home that a parent may give a child as a gift could suddenly be worth well above &euro;225,000 due to the market.  An adult child in full-time education might have to take out a loan to pay the tax.  It is ridiculous.  I am calling for one provision or the other but not both.  I am unsure whether I like the measure anyway, but I could see some room for it if it provided for an adult child under 25 years or in full-time education.  We are making numerous assumptions in this case, including that the majority of people are sorted by the time they are 25 years of age.  The facts suggest that this is not the case any more.  The 18 year old of my day is now perhaps 25, 26 or 27 years of age.  Parents support children far later in their lives than previously.

This is supported by economic literature, as well as by OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, analyses which underscore how an annual tax on land and buildings has a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.  I am just back from a recent ECOFIN meeting at which the issue of reducing labour taxes by spreading them to other areas was discussed.  The Government is determined to do everything in its power to protect and support the creation of jobs and the introduction of a local property tax was part of a broader approach to the taxation of property.  I expect the allocation of local property tax to local authorities will provide a sounder financial footing for the provision of local services that will lead to greater transparency and accountability at local level, as well as a stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability which can only benefit the provision of services.<\/p><p>Ireland was the only OECD member state that did not have a recurring property tax and allowed tax relief on rent and mortgage interest payments, as well as on capital gains by way of a principal private residence relief and capital acquisitions by way of a dwelling house relief.

With the scale of this deficit, based on a minimum funding standard update from the IASS actuaries in December 2013, the estimated coverage for deferred as well as active members' benefits would be in the range of from 24% to 31%.  This takes account of the pensions legislation introduced in December 2013 that allows reductions to be made to pensions in payment.<\/p><p>The solution proposed involves funding of over &euro;260 million from Aer Lingus and the DAA to help mitigate the impact of the trustee proposal.  Aer Lingus is holding an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders today - the meeting commenced at 2 p.m. - to seek shareholder approval to contribute &euro;190.7 million towards the fund.  This is a single issue EGM.  There is only one resolution to be voted on and shareholders can either vote in favour of it or against it; they cannot vary it.  The board of Aer Lingus has issued a recommendation to shareholders to accept the proposal as it considers that it is the only viable solution capable of being accepted and implemented by the affected parties.<\/p><p>On this basis and in view of the very significant risks that will arise for all members, the companies and the wider economy in the event of failure of this solution, the State's shareholding is being voted in favour of the resolution at today's EGM.<\/p><p>The deficit in this scheme is so large that the scheme is unsustainable as it cannot meet the minimum funding standard.  The solution proposed is the result of more than four years of complex negotiations involving the parties.  Earlier this year, an expert panel was established by my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, ICTU and IBEC tasked with finding the fairest way to distribute the burden of resolving the current deficit in the scheme.  As a result of that process, the total contribution of over &euro;260 million includes almost &euro;20 million in extra funding proposed by the employers in addition to the &euro;40 million already being made available for deferred members, bringing the full amount for this group to &euro;60 million.<\/p><p>The deferred members are particularly affected by the proposal to co-ordinate their pension with the State pension as they have left service.  However, while there may have been an expectation of unco-ordinated pensions, the reality is that this was neither funded by the members nor the employers.  Only those members who have paid for unco-ordination will maintain that under the current proposals.  There are no funds available to mitigate the loss of this element of the proposals.<\/p><p>On Friday 14 November 2014, the trustee sought approval from the Pensions Authority for a funding proposal and requested that I commence legislative provisions to facilitate implementation if approved.  The trustee believes this is in the overall best interests of the members of the IASS.  This was also the view of the expert panel.  Following requests on behalf of deferred members that more funding be made available for that group, I raised this issue directly with the employers.  However, it was clear that the funding proposed is the maximum that can be achieved.<\/p><p>Having considered this and having reflected on all of the issues, including the significant deficit in the region of from &euro;700 million to &euro;750 million, I signed the commencement order on 17 November 2014.  Had I not signed the order, this would have posed an unquantifiable risk to the entire scheme and could have had profoundly serious implications for all members of the scheme.  I met with the deferred members group on 4 December to set out my position and to explain why I commenced the provisions.  I am extremely conscious of the difficulties the funding proposals will cause for many members, but the risks that will arise for all members, the companies and the wider economy in the event of failure of this solution are even greater.  I believe that the funding proposal put forward by the trustee offers the best possible outcome for all members given the exceptionally acute difficulties and unsustainable circumstances of this fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000027#BB00900","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1418221200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister coming to the House at short notice.  I put forward an amendment to the Order of Business this morning which was accepted and I welcome his attendance.<\/p><p>It is just one day since we received good news in the context of Waterford Crystal because of a European Court judgment.  Waterford Crystal is doubly insolvent.  It is an insolvent company with an insolvent pension scheme.  We crunched the numbers in regard to Waterford Crystal workers versus deferred members of the IASS scheme, which is a profitable company with hundreds of millions of euro on deposit. <\/p> <p>They are worse off now, to the tune of 15% to 20%, compared to Waterford Crystal workers.  The Minister said that the resolution of the IASS funding difficulties is primarily a matter for the trustees, the companies participating in the scheme, the scheme members and the Pensions Authority.  If that is the case, why did the Government bring forward legislation, the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill, to allow this?  It is the first time a Government has legislated for a specific private pension scheme.  The Government did that on the back of what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, did in the social welfare and pensions legislation in which she changed priority orders and actually brought in single insolvencies.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, referred to the legislation of December 2013, in which a roadmap is set.  It is gravely disappointing.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Minister met the deferred members.  He will be aware that there was protest in the airport today by the Retired Aviation Staff Association, RASA, and deferred members that was attended by my colleague, Senator Averil Power.  Are the Minister and his pensions officials in the Department aware that the retired members will carry the full risk of that scheme into the future?  Not only will they lose six weeks' pay, they will also carry the burden of a 2.53% continuing levy.  That is just the retired members, not to mention the deferred members.  One man whom I have met is due to retire next March.  He will lose 48% of his pension.  If that was happening anywhere else, there would be uproar.<\/p><p>The Minister has not seen people on the streets about this because there are 15,000 people involved.  Trust me, however, that what the Government has done with this scheme will happen to most of the other commercial semi-State companies.  It has provided a roadmap.  Today, the Minister, on behalf of the taxpayer, acceded to these savage cuts in existing pensions, retained benefits and to existing members who have been bullied into an inferior scheme.  Aer Lingus and the other companies have effectively written off &euro;500 million as a result of the Government introducing legislation which was voted for by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The nature of the cuts is disproportionate.  I acknowledge that the Minister has spoken to the people concerned, but how would he feel about this?  Does anybody think this is fair?<\/p><p>The Minister said the deficit is &euro;700 million to &euro;750 million.  He also confirmed that the deficit has doubled in the last two years.  Why has it doubled?  The companies starved the scheme of money.  Unfortunately, I only have four minutes to speak.  This is the first time something such as this has happened.  We will continue to fight this in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill next week.  The T&aacute;naiste should be ashamed of herself.  She met these groups and gave them false hope three weeks ago.  She sat at the table and said that she would examine a more workable and fairer solution.  What has happened here today is the final insult.  The State has used the taxpayers' share in Aer Lingus to vote for savage cuts to existing members of this scheme.<\/p><p>There are other ways of dealing with this.  The Minister did not have to do this by 1 January next.  He went ahead and signed the commencement orders, but we have tabled amendments for next week.  What has been done with this scheme will be done with countless schemes throughout the country.  The Minister has given free rein and a roadmap to all employers, be they the State, semi-State or private companies, effectively to write off any pension debts that exist.  The people who will pay for it are the people who have been encouraged by successive Governments to make provision for their retirements.  It is absolutely outrageous and disgraceful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000027#BB01000","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418221800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>This is a very complicated and serious issue.

As the Minister said, the scheme has a substantial deficit of between &euro;700 million and &euro;750 million and that had to be addressed.<\/p><p>The view of the expert panel established to help resolve the IASS difficulties is that the funding proposals represented the best possible outcome that can be achieved and that if this final opportunity to resolve the very protracted and diverse dispute was not grasped now, the situation facing the IASS members would deteriorate further.  The view that this course of action is in the overall best interests of the members of the IASS has been confirmed to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, by the trustees.  The Minister is conscious of the difficulties that the funding proposals will cause for many members.  However, what is the alternative?  The unfortunate fact is that if the Minister had not signed the commencement order the risks that would have arisen for all members, the companies and the wider economy in the event of a failure of this solution are even greater.<\/p><p>I refer again to the fact that the deficit is between &euro;700 million and &euro;750 million at present.

Williams, a large supermarket company, went out of business 30 or 40 years ago.  It had been in business for almost 100 years and it told its employees that their pensions, at least, were safe.

On this particular issue, I find myself in agreement with my colleagues on the other side of the House.  Let us look at the scenario as it is.  Many of the people on these deferred pensions agreed to retire early and have their pensions deferred on the simple and clear understanding that they would have a pension of a certain figure.  Everyone in life has expectations.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work.  In this particular case, one is dealing with clear discrimination between people on pensions and people on deferred pensions.  I have no problem whatsoever in seeing pensions reduced in size but what is good for one should be good for the other.  The people who find themselves in a deferred pension situation are being totally blackguarded.  I think the unions only woke up to this at a late stage.  Effective negotiation should have happened but did not happen.  It should be righted.  We have a responsibility to err on the side of natural justice and to be fair to people.  This is clearly unfair.<\/p><p>The one thing Government has a responsibility to do is to be equal and give equity and fairness.  It is not really the Minister's fault because he inherited it but he should try to come up with a creative way of resolving it.  If it means that the DAA and Aer Lingus have to put their hands in their pockets and come up with money because of the absolute mess made of the scheme in the first place by the trustees of the time, so be it.  If they have to put their hands in their pockets and put in another &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million in order to give these people fair play, that should be done.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000029#DD01500","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1418222400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I also share the concerns that have been expressed by Senator Power and Senator Darragh O'Brien who has been leading it on this side.  My involvement came about because I was spokesperson on social protection on our side of the House when it was first introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act.  I share all of the opinions voiced by Senator Conway.  In fact, I could not have put it as well as he did.  I also agree that the Minister is inheriting a legacy but the great US President, Harry Truman, had a sign on his desk that said \"the buck stops here.\"  We are dealing with the here and now.<\/p><p>I have met many of those who are suffering as a result of the deferred pension situation.  I have looked them in the eye and I presume the Minister has done so as well.  When one is dealing with people like that on a human level who have this level of expectation over many years, I would have hated to have been put in a situation where I had been making a contribution and had taken early retirement in the expectation that I was going to get what I paid in only to find that not only was it going to be cut but would be cut so drastically in some cases that it would go down to a less than livable figure.  At a time when the Government is trying to encourage more people into private pension schemes although God knows, their policies over the past couple of years in that regard would lead one to question that commitment and when there is a time bomb in respect of pensions going forward, I would have thought that the Government would have seen the signs here and taken advantage of it.  Apart from the technicalities involved, the difficulty is that under the most recent EUROSTAT statistics, this Government has now received an extra &euro;2 billion as a result of the revision of the statistics.  I know the Minister is very aware of the statistics and he is able to draw on his considerable mental resources to be able to put forward an argument, as we have often see here in this House, which is admirable.  He will know better than most that there is a high level of expectation of this Government as a result of the turnaround in the economy, all of which we welcome.  That level of expectation has extended to these ordinary people.  They are ordinary five eighths who will now find themselves with a significant reduction in their pensions as a result of this.  I plead with the Minister to at least try to do something to address this issue despite its complexities which I fully recognise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000029#DD01600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1418222400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I will begin by making one point very clear.

With regard to what I have done, I was privileged to have been appointed to this role and I was faced with a choice about taking a decision that would have created serious and unknown consequences for the members of the scheme.  Let me say what they are.  I will repeat that this is based on the minimum funding standard update from the IASS actuaries in December 2013.  I have been informed that the estimated coverage for deferred and active members' benefits is in the range of 24% to 31%.  That is the scale of the risk that people face.<\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn articulated something that has resonated as I have grappled intensely with the issue.  He said there are no easy answers to this, which is something I feel so strongly.  I also know there are some answers about which I am clear on the consequences.  Not supporting this process in the way the Government believes is necessary would create vast risk for the largest pension fund in our country.  That is the challenge I, the Government and, collectively, we all face with regard to pension funds in our country.<\/p><p>With regard to specific questions about my relationship with the trustees, legal responsibility for the management of a pension fund sits with the trustees of the fund.  The moment we move away from recognising that principle, we will weaken the sanction, scrutiny and responsibility necessary for people who are paid to run any pension fund.  With regard to the consequences of the 2013 Act and the change in the priority order, I know how contested it is and was at the time.  Are we saying that the alternative before the Act was fairer?  In the event of a pension fund wind-up, the people working - the active members of the scheme - would receive much less than those who were retired.  The heart of the challenge we face is how, with scarce resources available to the pension funds, competing demands are managed.<\/p><p>The last time I came to the House, everyone asked me about the contribution the companies are making.  It is &euro;260 million, with &euro;190 million from Aer Lingus and &euro;70 million from DAA.  On foot of the debate here, I contacted the companies and spoke to them about the issue.  This is as Members expect me to do, so that when I answer questions from them about why the companies do not put in more funding, I can say I have asked the question and pressed the companies.  Each of these independent companies with its own board of directors has put in the maximum it is prepared and able to do.  This is an increase compared to the position at the beginning of the process.<\/p><p>Let us begin with the charge that has been made that nothing has happened or that not enough has happened.  The process has been going on for years.  Nearly every labour body and every union has in the land has been involved and, after all that, an expert panel had to be appointed to try to chart this to where we are now, fraught with difficulty as it is.  To say that not enough has happened belies the major amount of work done to get to this point.  From having met individuals affected by this on many occasions, having read a huge amount of correspondence on this and having met for many hours the committee that represents individuals directly affected by this as deferred members, I know that the human cost of this is real, immense and deeply worrying for people.<\/p><p>I will conclude where I began.  The Government believes that this process offers the best hope of securing some level of support for people in the future.  I accept the worry and anger that it is not what they would want or what they hoped for but, after four years of effort and intensive engagement by many, is it is my belief that this offers the best opportunity for securing some support for people.  The final stages that need to be completed offer the last and best opportunity for us all in this deeply serious matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000030#EE00700","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sustainable Agriculture and Dairy Price Outlook: Statements","time":1418223000,"counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000030#EE00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1418223000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for the opportunity to outline the work my Department and its agencies have being doing to ensure the long-term environmental sustainability of Irish agriculture.  The task of feeding the world while saving the planet, which sounds lofty but is a true reflection of the situation, is one of the greatest challenges facing this generation.  Almost 900 million people do not have sufficient food right now, and the figure is doubled when we include the hidden hunger of nutrient deficiency.  As the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050, the task of feeding everyone and ending the scourge of hunger will become all the more challenging.<\/p><p>It is not just a matter of growing numbers of people.  As countries develop and more people move into what is considered the global middle class, they demand more variety and better food, more of the type of high-quality protein produced by Ireland, for example.  The OECD says that this middle class will increase in number from 500 million today to around 3 billion by 2025.<\/p><p>For our agrifood sector, the opportunity from this growing food market is immense and so is the challenge, because we have to produce all this food while respecting the environmental limitations of the planet.  It is not acceptable to sacrifice the future to the needs of the present by producing food in a way that degrades our soil and water, destroys our biodiversity or exacerbates climate change.  It is clear that sustainable intensification of food production - producing more food while respecting and enhancing the environment - is the way forward.<\/p> <p>Ireland has been a champion of this approach for several years in the European Union and internationally and I believe we are showing the way in how to do this in a practical way.  My ambition is that we should be, and be seen to be, a clear global leader in sustainable food production.  That is why I am here to briefly outline some of things we are doing to achieve this ambition and to seek the input of Senators.<\/p><p>In October the Taoiseach succeeded in persuading his colleagues in the European Council to adopt sustainable intensification as EU policy on agriculture and climate change.  This was the culmination of years of work by my colleagues and me in government in seeking to persuade the Commission and other member states of the urgency of this issue and the appropriateness of this approach.  I regard the European Council's statement as a very significant development, on which I hope future EU policy on agriculture and climate change - on agriculture and the environment generally - will be built.  Ireland is also deeply engaged on this issue at international level.  In the UN negotiations on climate change we have been one of the strongest advocates for a specific work programme on agriculture.  What we are seeking at both EU and UN level is to develop a coherent approach to the twin challenges of climate change and food security, something sadly lacking up to now.  <\/p><p>At national level, my Department is developing a low carbon transition and mitigation plan as set out under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.   This plan will take into account existing mitigation commitments and also outline a longer term view and seek to balance the objectives of allowing the food industry to grow so as to meet the food security challenges that face the world, as well as the need to meet future climate change ambitions.  We are also preparing an agricultural adaptation plan which will seek to plan for the positive and negative impacts of climate change.<\/p><p>Emissions targets aside, Ireland must also meet stringent standards for water quality to meet our obligations under the water framework directive.  Fortunately, Ireland has a favourable water quality status when compared to most other EU member states; however, there is little room for complacency in meeting the ambitious targets laid down in the directive.  We face similar challenges in halting the loss of biodiversity.<\/p><p>Food Harvest 2020 set out a plan for smart green growth of the agrifood sector.  The fourth annual progress report on the implementation of the strategy was produced earlier this year and outlines the many areas where progress has been made.  Just two weeks ago I announced plans for a new agri-food strategy taking us to 2025, which I expect to be published next summer.  Sustainability will again be at heart of this new strategy which will build on the very strong foundations laid in the implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.<\/p><p>The Origin Green sustainability programme is a key element of the implementation of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  Since its launch in June 2012, it has been enthusiastically adopted by the food and drink sector in Ireland.  As the first national programme of its kind to be rolled out anywhere in the world, it presents a major opportunity to differentiate Irish food and drink products from those of our competitors.  At farm level, the beef and dairy sectors have fully established sustainability measures built into each inspection, which to date have covered more than 70,000 beef and dairy farms.  Similar programmes will be rolled out over the course of 2015 for pigmeat, poultry, lamb, grain and horticultural production.  More than 90% of all beef produced in Ireland is covered by the programme.  In the first nine months of its roll-out to dairy farmers, over 40% have applied to join the programme.  This rate of progress is expected to continue during the course of 2015.  In essence, we can say we are now literally measuring the carbon footprint of beef herds at farm level using a carbon calculator internationally certified by the UK carbon trust.  The broadening scope of the farm element of the programme to incorporate water, biodiversity and energy and socioeconomic information reflects the ongoing evolution of the programme to ensure it retains relevance and can help Ireland to achieve its goal of becoming a world leader in sustainable production.<\/p><p>In addition to the work done at farm level, more than 375 food and drink manufacturing companies have registered to participate in Origin Green, while almost 300 companies have signed up to the newly developed Origin Green online platform.  The programme aims to have 75% of exports covered by members of Origin Green by the end of the year and by the end of 2015 it is anticipated that this figure will exceed 85%.  Setting measurable and independently verifiable goals, it will enable us to achieve our ambition of seeing 100% of our food exports on the road to sustainability by 2016.<\/p><p>Ireland's water quality is favourable when compared to that in many other EU member states, with nitrate and phosphorus levels in water reducing in recent years.  The EPA has identified a number of reasons for this reduction, including our implementation of the nitrates regulations.  Earlier this year I worked closely with my former colleague, Phil Hogan, in reviewing these regulations to ensure the correct balance between supporting efficient farming and reducing nutrient loss from agriculture.<\/p><p>To support biodiversity, I introduced the Environmental Impact Assessment in Agriculture Regulations in 2011, designed to ensure environmental screening of certain agricultural developments at no cost to the farmer in supporting our biodiversity ambitions.  More recently, my Department is supporting the rolling out of both the Kerry Life and Aran Life programmes aimed squarely at supporting biodiversity in these areas.  Supporting biodiversity will be a key theme also within the forthcoming rural development programme which I will mention.<\/p><p>Together with high national standards for water quality, biodiversity and animal welfare, Ireland is rightly regarded as being among the most climate-efficient EU countries where food can be produced with least impact on the environment.  This record of Irish agriculture in producing meat, dairy and other products with a low and improved carbon footprint is important to our credibility in persuading our colleagues in Europe to recognise the need for coherence in the European Union's food security and climate change objectives, as evidenced in the recent European Council conclusions to which I referred.  In 2011 the European Commission's joint research centre published a study which confirmed that Ireland was a highly efficient food producer in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output.  Senators can see the figures in the text of my speech, if they have received a copy.  Research from Cranfield University in the United Kingdom, in conjunction with Bord Bia, shows that in a world in which fresh water is scarce Ireland has one of the lowest water stress measurements in the world, in other words, we can produce more food without having to worry about running out of water.  This highlights the essential role of sound research to back up our claims about sustainability in Irish agriculture.  We are supporting a range of research initiatives, at national and international level, on the many dimensions of sustainable agriculture.<\/p><p>In this regard, my Department has three competitive research funding programmes: Stimulus for agricultural production, FIRM for food production and CoFoRD for forestry research.  Sustainability and resource efficiency were key themes in recent research awards under these programmes.  As late as this morning, we launched the latest research programme in this area, which means that in the past three years we have made &euro;85 million available for research on nutrition, sustainability and more efficient and better ways to produce food, while protecting the environment.  This says a lot about the Government's commitment to the sector.  While supporting research, I have also concentrated on converting it into real action on the ground and positive improvements at farm level.  Initiatives include the carbon navigator tool, jointly developed by Teagasc and Bord Bia, which focuses on incentivising the adoption of best practices, allowing individual farmers to achieve greenhouse gas reductions and increase their efficiency.  In October last year Teagasc launched a sustainability demonstration farm at Kildalton, where best practice in sustainable farming will be implemented, evaluated and shared.  The project will be rolled out on a phased basis and plays an important role in training our next generation of farmers in the concept and practical aspects of agricultural sustainability.  This research and implementation work, coupled with a comprehensive environmental impact study commissioned by my Department of Food Harvest 2020 and, most importantly, a thorough SWOT analysis, has helped to inform the policy strategies and design of several measures in our draft rural development programme which will take us to 2020.<\/p> <p> I will set out the position on Common Agricultural Policy reform.  The CAP has been a significant contributor to the environmental sustainability of the European agrifood sector in recent years and I was pleased, as chair of the European Council of Ministers, to have reached agreement on a new Common Agricultural Policy framework in June last year.  Under the CAP, farmers will continue to enjoy significant supports but will have to comply with various requirements under cross-compliance measures, including statutory management requirements and the good agricultural and environmental condition provisions under Pillar 1.  In addition they will have access to a range of enhanced and targeted agri-environmental measures under Pillar 2 of the CAP, the Rural Development Programme.  I hope we will have these approved in the not too distant future.<\/p><p>Under Pillar 1, the newly reformed CAP provides additional opportunities to support sustainable food production.  The focus on environmental protection has been strengthened, with the provision of a compulsory green direct payment under Pillar 1.  This will account for approximately 30% of a farmer's total payment.  In other words, if a farmer does not meet the requirements which are rather straightforward and easy to understand, he or she loses 30% of the single farm payment and is potentially liable for penalties also.<\/p><p>Environmental measures continue to be a strong feature of the draft rural development programme under Pillar 2 of the CAP.  A key measure is the new green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, designed for 50,000 farmers at it peak in several years time.  Financial incentives for farmers in implementing measures to support climate change, water quality and biodiversity ambitions will be available under the scheme.  Additionally, support will be available for locally-led agri-environmental schemes that can be specifically targeted to meet local circumstances.  Initially, this will include expanding the existing Burren farming for conservation scheme, but it will also include a completely new and targeted project aimed at conserving the freshwater pearl mussel, one of the most endangered species in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Rural Development Programme also includes measures on organic farming, areas of natural constraint and support for capital investments to address environmental objectives, for example, low emissions spreading equipment and manure storage.  In addition, we will be supporting the establishment of knowledge transfer groups to optimise the environment for the transfer of the most up-to-date information on over 25,000 farms and the introduction of a cutting edge beef genomics scheme which will further improve the greenhouse gas intensity of beef production systems.<\/p><p>Some &euro;4 billion in European and national funding has been earmarked for investment in the agrifood industry and the rural economy generally during the seven year lifetime of the new programme.  However, the draft programme must be formally approved by the European Commission before it can be rolled out nationally.  Securing this approval is an absolute priority for me and my Department.<\/p><p>The role forestry plays in contributing to climate change mitigation is often underestimated.  That is why securing recognition of the role our forests play in carbon sequestration at EU level is so significant.  I was pleased, therefore, when the European Council's conclusions in October specifically noted the role afforestation could play in carbon sequestration.  This is important for Ireland as afforestation is a major greenhouse gas mitigation measure that we are undertaking on agricultural land.  Under the proposed new forestry programmes it is aimed to plant 43,000 ha of new forest and build 690 km of new roads during the period 2015 to 2020.  Management of these forests must adhere to the principles of sustainable forest management by addressing, in equal measure, the economic, social and environmental benefits forestry can deliver.<\/p><p>The initiatives I have outlined are covered in greater detail in a short paper for Senators.  At this stage I hope everyone has received a copy, but, if not, it will be distributed presently.  These initiatives will play an important role in underlying sustainable production systems in the future.  Ongoing scientific research and investment in knowledge transfer leading to a high adoption rate of best practice at farm and processing level will be a critical success factor in striving towards our sustainable environmental goals.  Recently, well informed international visitors, including the head of agriculture at the World Bank, have been impressed by what we are doing in the area of sustainable agriculture, but I am ambitious for us to do far more.  Given our natural advantages and the quality of agricultural research, we should seek to be the global leader in sustainable food production.  To say the least, this is not an easy task, but it is achievable.  Achievement of the environmental ambitions of the water framework directive or delivery of the national biodiversity plan will be significant challenges, but we have done much already.  Measures such as those included in the Rural Development Programme can continue to take us forward in a positive way.<\/p><p>I realise Senators were keen for me to speak briefly about dairy prices because it is a current issue.  There has been much difficulty and friction in the past 12 months on the back of beef prices weakening.  I am pleased to say things are now moving in the opposite direction and beef prices are strengthening.  There is scarcity, prices are getting stronger and the measures agreed at the beef forum have brought greater transparency to the calculation of prices.  This was helpful, in particular, from the point of view of farmers.<\/p><p>It appears that we are heading into a difficult six month period in the case of dairy prices.  Teagasc expects an average dairy price next year of approximately 27 cent per litre, down from approximately 37 cent per litre in the past year.  This is a major issue and it happens to be arising at the same time as we are planning for expansion and many dairy farmers are borrowing and making investments.  The cost of production on a dairy farm will be somewhere between 25 cent to 28 cent per litre.  When the price of milk falls to more or less the cost of production, major challenges arise.  Dairy farmers receive the highest single farm payment of approximately &euro;18,000 on average.  Despite this, Teagasc has predicted that they could see a halving of their income next year, from an average of &euro;64,000 this year down to approximately &euro;34,000 next year.  This prediction may not come true and we will have to wait and see what happens in the marketplace.  There are things we can and will do to try to bring a balance to the market and have a floor for prices if they begin to fall rapidly in the coming weeks.  The price in New Zealand is approximately 19 cent or 20 cent per litre for farmers.  The price in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is approximately 21 cent per litre.  In Ireland those farmers still producing milk are getting over 30 cent per litre.<\/p><p>We need to anticipate problems and plan.  I have spoken in a serious way to all of the major banks in Ireland to discuss how they can support farmers in getting through what I regard as a temporary pricing issue.  We need to work with Teagasc to ensure farmers manage their businesses and farm enterprises through a difficult period in minimising the costs of inputs and so on.  Most important, we need to continue the conversation with the Commission, in particular, Ireland's Commissioner, to ensure it uses the tools available to try to bring a balance and stability to a market that will encounter difficulties in the coming months.  These tools include aid to private storage which we are using effectively in the case of butter production.  Ireland has used approximately 40% of what the European Union has paid out so far.  This represents a significant and efficient use of the allocation.  Another tool is export refunds.  In other words, we could offload product outside the European Union cheaply and look to the Commission to make up the difference in price.  This is an expensive option and one that is unpopular outside the European Union because it is seen as dumping on the markets of others and causing problems in them.  I imagine the Commission would be slow to adopt this measure, although I can understand why many Irish co-operatives are keen to see export refunds in place in order that they could offload some of their product in storage.  <\/p><p>The third tool available to the Commission is intervention pricing.<\/p> <p>In other words, the Commission would buy product at a guaranteed minimum price level so as to put a floor under a falling price.  It would store that product and then sell it in six or eight months time when the price had improved.  We may well seek the use of that tool by the Commission, but it is too early to say so yet.  In the next couple of weeks, we must monitor carefully what happens to dairy prices.  Luckily, from the Irish perspective, most dairy farmers are drying off currently or have already dried off and we do not have anything like peak production of milk currently.  However, this will become a serious issue for the broader sector when spring milk starts to come through.  We also have product in storage that our co-ops must off-load and this is a concern.<\/p><p>One of the reasons for the difficulty is that the Russian market is closed.  However, the primary reason is that for two years in a row there have been bumper harvests globally which have resulted in cheap grain, cheap feed barley and cheap maize.  When we have cheap grain, it is only a matter of time before milk production increases dramatically, particularly in places like the United States and India.  There has also been a very good grass growing season in New Zealand.  We have seen higher increases in output than expected globally, but there has been a slight slowdown in the pace of increased consumption in China.  As a result, there is more milk being produced than is being consumed.  This will not be replicated every year, but we must learn to deal with this temporary problem.  There are multiple ways of responding to this.<\/p><p>I wish to correct the record on something I said the last time I was in this House.  I wish to correct a statement I made to the Seanad on 12 November when I contributed to a debate on matters relating to fisheries in regard to the importance of seeking to attract operators from other countries to land and process a greater proportion of the fish caught in Irish waters around Ireland.  The record shows I stated that 1.2 billion tonnes of fish were caught in these waters.  I do not remember saying this, but if I did, it was wrong.  This was an error and what I meant to say was that the fishing opportunities in Irish waters have an estimated annual landed value of &euro;1.2 billion - as opposed to a catch of 1.2 billion tonnes - and that this provides great potential for our coastal communities, particularly if we can attract more vessels to land and process fish in Ireland.  In other words, only a relatively small proportion of the fish being caught around our coastline are being landed in our fisheries' harbours and we need to change that.

I appreciate the correction he has made.<\/p><p>On the issue of sustainable agriculture, Fianna F&aacute;il believes sustainable agriculture must involve a fair price for farmers who produce food in an environmentally sound manner.  Farmers are the custodians of the land and must be recognised for their role.  The Government has washed its hands of the issue and has failed to live up to the commitment of the Lisbon treaty in ensuring that farmers get a fair standard of living from the land.  We call for an independent beef regulator to rebalance the power between the various actors in the market and for a special &euro;200 per head beef genomics payment in 2015 to boost incomes.  The Government's task is to create a strong, fair framework for the market to operate in so as not to leave farmers hanging in the wind at the mercy of big processors and large supermarkets.  The Minister should prioritise working with the new Agricultural Commissioner, Commissioner Hogan, at EU level to place renewed emphasis on achieving a fair return for farm produce.  There is a great opportunity for the Minister to do this.<\/p><p>In regard to the agrifood industry, the Minister has outlined the significant benefits this industry adds to the economy.  The Rubicon of reducing the CAP budget has been crossed and the CAP will, inevitably, be further reduced in future years, no matter who is in power.  This highlights the pressing need to emphasise a fair price for farmers in the future.<\/p><p>Looking at Pillar 1, single farm payments for Ireland have been reduced by &euro;42 million per annum, from &euro;1.255 billion to &euro;1.213 billion, a 3.3% cut.  However, if we factor in inflation at 7%, this is a 10% cut in real terms over the period.  I know the Minister has done, as the late Jackie Healy-Rae used to say, &quot;his level best&quot; within Europe to get the best deal, but we must face up to the fact that Pillar 2 funding for Ireland, &euro;2.2 billion, is a decrease of &euro;313 million, a 14% decrease in funding.  If we factor inflation into this, it is a 21% cut.  This is hard to accept.<\/p><p>I have listened to the Minister in regard to the difficulties in the dairy industry.  It is unreal to think that many farmers got out of milk because of the quota system imposed on them many years ago.  Most of the dairy farmers in the part of west Cork in which I live have long got out of milk production and dairy farmers are scarce in peninsular areas.  Now that the quota system is being abolished, there is huge fear and apprehension among farmers about what will happen.  It is a terrible turnaround for them to think that if Teagasc predictions are anywhere near right, they could lose 10 cent per litre of milk.  Most dairy farmers have spent large amounts of money and some of them have borrowed to develop their dairies and this vista will be difficult for them to live with.  <\/p><p>I made the point in the House before that I would hate to see Ireland develop along the same lines as New Zealand, where major factory type farmers operate, milking 1,500 or 2,000 cows.  If this happens here, we will reduce the number of active dairy farmers to approximately one quarter of the number we have currently.  This would not be good for family farms and is not something we would like to see here.<\/p><p>The annual Teagasc income report 2014 recorded grave disparities in farm incomes, with dry stock farmers falling seriously behind their counterparts.  Cattle rearing farms saw incomes decline by 22%, to &euro;9,469 due to higher production costs associated with severe fodder shortages in the previous year.  In particular, suckler cow farms are heavily reliant on the single farm payment to keep their heads above water.  The gradual reduction in the staged farm payments will cut the ground from under their feet if the Government does not step in to ensure a fair price for their produce in the marketplace. <\/p><p>Farmers operate small businesses in effect and are extremely vulnerable to the economies of scale and market power of larger actors in the industry.  Large supermarkets have used their buying strength to unilaterally reduce prices on a wide variety of produce by offering special deals etc.  These short-term measures inflict long-term damage on the industry by eliminating margins.  Supermarkets and processors need to live up to their responsibilities.  The Government has a key role in ensuring this.  Without a fair price to the primary producer, the entire food chain will collapse.<\/p><p>A number of factors, including labelling issues and processor manipulation, have created a sharp 12% reduction in beef prices, following hard on high prices for purchases last year.  This is driving farmers under pressure over the edge across the country.  Without going into too much detail on the beef crisis, there is a huge problem facing beef farmers.  The Minister set up round table discussions with the relevant industry interests, which is welcome, but he must ensure he keeps on top of this issue.  If the farmers producing milk, suckler cow farmers, or farmers producing calves and weanlings or farmers fattening cattle are not getting a fair price, there will be major implications down the line.<\/p><p>In the short term, a special &euro;200 per head beef genomics scheme should be introduced, particularly for farmers in the suckler cow sector.  This would cost approximately &euro;107 million and would provide a shot in the arm for the agriculture economy in 2015, when payment support from the European Union will slip to an unprecedented low and other schemes wind up.  I also have grave concerns about the operation of the new GLAS scheme and the maximum of &euro;5,000 that can be obtained.  Some time ago, the Minister assured me here that in so far as possible red tape would be reduced.  Some of the farmers I met in the Beara peninsula recently have grave concerns, because without GLAS, previously REPS, payments, they will find it hard to survive.<\/p><p>The Minister is faced with many challenges, whether in the beef or dairy sectors.<\/p> <p> We have a brilliant agrifood industry.  I wish the Minister well in this regard.  It is not easy to deal with all of these different issues, some of which are outside his control.  He has a battle on his hands and I wish him luck with it.  We should all wear the green jersey, fight for Ireland and fight for the farmers and try to get the best results for them.  Whatever some people in this capital city might think, farmers do go through tough times, whether it is with weather, prices for milk or beef, or other ongoing challenges.  I hope the Minister will do his utmost to ensure they get a fair return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000033#HH00200","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418225400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking the time to come to the House to discuss sustainable agriculture and the dairy price outlook.  First, however, I congratulate the Minister on the announcement today of a grant award of over &euro;20 million for agri-food and forestry research.  This will go towards 58 scientist posts and 53 postgraduate students in specialised training places.  This important investment in research will make a significant contribution to the sustainability and comprehensiveness of the Irish agrifood, forestry and aquaculture sectors.<\/p><p>With regard to sustainable agriculture, let us note that &quot;sustainable&quot; is defined as being able to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  It should be considered in everything we do in order to ensure overall growth of the economy and protection of the environment and high quality of life for all the citizens of our country.<\/p><p>Agriculture and forestry have major roles to play in achieving these goals.  Ireland has the potential to be a world leader in sustainable farming practices, sustainable forestry management, food production and research as we have a number of natural advantages.  According to research by the European Commission, Ireland is among the top five performing member states in the EU in terms of carbon footprint for the livestock sector.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has found that the temperate grassland production system, such as that in Ireland, is one of the most efficient in the world.<\/p><p>Ireland has already put in place many measures to improve our sustainable levels in agriculture.  A low carbon transition plan and a national climate change adaptation framework being prepared under the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2014 will drive the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient, environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  Programmes such as Origin Green are also available.  This is a Bord Bia voluntary sustainable programme aimed at demonstrating the commitment of the Irish food and drinks industry to produce in a sustainable manner while meeting increased international demand.  Schemes such as GLAS, the agri-environment options scheme, the organic farming action programme plan 2013-15 and the beef data and genomics scheme all promote sustainability in agriculture.  I agree with my colleague opposite that GLAS in particular is very important for farmers in the poorer parts of the country in order to sustain their income.<\/p><p>The Common Agricultural Policy has had a substantial involvement in the environmental sustainability of the European agrifood sector in recent years.  From 2015, the basic payment scheme will replace the single payment scheme.  Under the requirements of the basic payment scheme, farmers are subject to three greening measures - crop diversification, which is applicable to farmers holding more than 30 hectares of arable land; ecological focus areas, which are applicable to farmers with over 15 hectares of land; and the protection of permanent grassland.  It has been decided that this measure will be managed at a national level, thus there will be no implication for individual farmers unless national threshold levels are breached.  These greening measures will vastly improve the viability of sustainable agriculture in the future.  The level of emissions from agriculture has been steadily decreasing in recent years and I am sure the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue to work with State and industry parties to ensure greater future competencies in the sustainable Irish agriculture sector.<\/p><p>In regard to the dairy price cycle, we need to be ready for the abolition of quotas from early next year.  The ending of the milk quota regime represents a unique opportunity for the dairy industry to increase milk output and, as a result, the industry has set itself targets under Food Harvest 2020 of increasing milk production by 50% in the period to 2020.  However, there are approximately 18,000 dairy farmers across the country, so the price of milk is an extremely prevalent issue.  We cannot ignore the recent Teagasc report which predicts that average Irish milk prices in 2015 will fall to 27 cent per litre, a reduction of over 10 cent per litre on the average for 2014.  This follows several years of very good incomes on dairy farms.  It is likely to have a very serious impact on dairy farming incomes in 2015, with a reduction in excess of 50% possible on some farms.  These are very worrying statistics, on which we need to act.<\/p><p>We also see change occurring in the make-up of farms.  Several farmers are moving from beef to dairy and this will place even more pressure on the dairy sector.  We must acknowledge, however, there are a number of factors outside of everyone's control which are putting negative pressure on the global dairy price at the moment.  These include increased output of dairy production in countries such as the USA, New Zealand and Australia, and in the EU generally, due to favourable weather conditions this year, as the Minister mentioned in his statement, thus leaving more milk available on the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000034#JJ00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1418225400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.  I apologise as I have to leave to go to another meeting shortly.  In regard to the Minister's excellent presentation and his vision for Ireland as a future global leader in sustainable food production, I have a question for him on fluoridation.  As he knows, 98% of Europe has rejected fluoridation and Ireland is the only nation that is still fluoridating its water.  We had a slight exchange in the agriculture committee earlier in the year and I know it is a subject that interests the Minister and on which he is waiting for a report to come out.<\/p><p>Anything I am going to say is fact.  Fluoride is a highly poisonous substance.  In America, every box of toothpaste, by law, has to state that a pea-sized amount of toothpaste is potentially a poison, although I do not have the exact wording of that warning.  If somebody swallows more than a pea-sized amount, they need to contact a poison control centre - that is what is, by law, on every toothpaste box in America.<\/p><p>Critically, fluoride is added to tap water at potentially toxic levels.  A glass of Irish tap water contains the same amount of fluoride as a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.  Has an environmental study ever been commissioned by the Irish Government on the effect of artificially fluoridated water on our food and agriculture?  Have the National Food Centre, Teagasc or Bord Bia ever tested the level of fluorides in our foodstuffs or drinks?<\/p><p>I have followed the Minister from the beginning of my time in the House and I am a great admirer of his and all he has done.  I am also a huge admirer of Origin Green and of all that has been done in regard to Food Harvest 2020 and now the 2025 strategy.  However, I could not let today go and talk about the future of the Irish agri-food industry without mentioning this topic which is in black and white in front of us.  Why are we the only nation that does this?  Israel, which has had fluoride for decades, banned it this year and it is prohibited by law in the Netherlands, whereas it is the law to have it here.  I do not believe the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is ever brought into the bigger picture.  Water is a huge ingredient in our agriculture and food and drinks sectors.  This is something that needs to be addressed.  I would love to hear the Minister's opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000034#JJ00300","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1418226000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here and, as ever, for presenting his case with clarity.  There is much to be positive about here.  The Minister outlined examples such as the research that is ongoing, the Origin Green programme and the involvement of Teagasc with Glanbia.  All sorts of projects, schemes and research are ongoing, all of which are heading in the right direction and all of which are saying that sustainable agriculture is the way of the future.  Indeed, I look forward to a moment when we will be able to debate agriculture without putting the word \"sustainable\" in front of it, because it must be sustainable.  No other form of agriculture is possible, and this has always been the case.<\/p><p>The Minister said at the conclusion of his speech that he wants to do more because our natural advantages offer us that opportunity, and I could not agree more.  My concern arises from this.  Because of our natural advantages and the way agriculture has developed in Ireland - as part of our DNA and culture - it was never organised on a business model, and it certainly has not developed in that way.  If we look at sustainability, what is missing is the notion of keeping rural communities sustainable, because without the rural community, nothing else is sustained in the way one would want it to be.  One certainly will not be able to sustain the natural advantages in the way we do business, as we do now.  Senator O'Donovan alluded to the notion of factory farming or big industrial farming, as we see in many other countries, and I concur with his point.  I do not think that is a model that would continue to give us the advantages the Minister has spoken about.  My worry is that if we do not continue to sustain rural communities, the very things knocking at the door are those big industrial-type farms, which of themselves are a different beast and have different sustainability requirements.  I would be very interested in hearing the Minister's view, because we have seen what the free market does with prices to farmers in respect of milk, beef and so on.  We see what happens when the free market is all we have.  <\/p><p>Farmers are struggling.  I am not talking about the very big farmers.  The average farmer works very hard to make a decent living.  They are the custodians of our environment and they do have a huge responsibility.  We ask a lot of them in providing good, clean food and also being the guardians of the environment.  I am not sure whether we pay them terribly well for the latter, and sometimes for the former.  If we do not make it attractive for them to stay - if we do not say that our communities need to be sustained every time we stand up and have this conversation, and if we do not say that this is what we want and this is what we are aiming for - the whole notion of sustainability, with all the research, investment and schemes, will not be redundant but will be disconnected from that idea.  That is my fundamental worry.  I worry that we are heading away from rural communities and that kind of sustainability.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's remarks on that because, for me, that is the driving dilemma.  I have no doubt about the Minister's bona fides and his policies in respect of crops, water, beef genomics and so on.  I just worry about that bigger picture.  I am not convinced that we are yet in a position at which our rural communities are on a sustainable path, because they require support, infrastructure and investment.  I am not talking about a sentimental way of life - dancing at the crossroads.  That is not what I am about at all.  I support vibrant rural communities and hard-working farmers who can make a living and will continue to farm.  Senator O'Donovan said that there are people who are moving out of dairy farming in the peninsula.  People are moving out of farming in lots of places.  That is just my fear - that we are the last of the nations to move into industrial farming.  I am worried that this is where we are headed if we do not make that a central part of this debate.  Otherwise, all of this is not quite redundant, but it seems to me to be the add-on piece, and I would also like to see the central piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000035#KK00100","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1418226000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  Actually, I am not sure he is all that welcome, because I put some thoughts together before he came in and he must have read my speech - or at least, he said exactly what I had planned to say.  I planned to start off by talking about the fact that the world's population would increase from 6.7 billion people to 9 billion people by 2050 and asking how we are going to feed all those people.  I did not anticipate the figures the Minister gave, and I was very impressed by them because I planned to talk about the challenges and opportunities in the dairy market.  I did not know of the likely anticipated surplus stock in the dairy sector, particularly in China.<\/p><p>The fact that we have such an increase in the world's population means that we need to look at new ways to farm if we are to continue.  How are we going to feed those 9 billion people?  If we continue along the same path, emissions will continue to increase, we will waste water and we will continue to kill crucial animals and insects.  There are some very interesting examples from Europe.  The Netherlands is notable in that it is moving ahead with technology and improved farming techniques, which I am sure the Minister is aware of.  New animal sheds are being installed with underground conveyer belts which remove manure instantly.  As a result, the Netherlands has the second lowest level of animal carbon emissions in the EU.  Some of the greenhouses in the Netherlands have solar panels which produce energy for homes.  I think we can do a lot more in introducing technology such as this to Irish farms.  In addition, the Dutch example is interesting, as they are using this sort of expertise in technology and intensive farming and selling it abroad.  One Dutch university has close links with China's biggest company.  Ireland, with such renowned and massive dairy production, should be selling its expertise abroad in a similar way, and maybe we are.  I am involved with the Institute of Food and Health in UCD and I know it has a strong link with universities in China.  I have previously raised the example of Fonterra, the New Zealand dairy co-operative, which is establishing its own farms in China.  Most interestingly, it is developing dairy products specifically to cater to the tastes of the Chinese consumer.  The fragmentation of our dairy industry is hindering us and we have much more to do in terms of food innovation - not just selling Irish food products abroad, but developing country-specific products and catering for those specific markets.  <\/p><p>Many scientists will agree that we need more intensive farming.  That is not to say we need more crowding of animals into small spaces, but we need to increase productivity and look at areas that use fewer resources.  It has been found that white meat is much better than red meat in terms of damage to the environment.  It takes two kilograms of feed to produce one kilogram of chicken, while it takes five to 20 kilograms of feed to produce one kilogram of beef.  We must take this into account.  The figures are huge.<\/p><p>When we talk about sustainable agriculture, we also need to ask the difficult questions about genetically modified crops.  I think I am the only one who ever talks about genetically modified crops.  Everybody else seems to shiver when they hear about them.  It is a simple fact that organic farming will not be able to feed the world.  The proponents of genetically modified products argue that altering crops is nothing new, given that we have been altering crops genetically for 10,000 years.  In respect of the safety of crops, the European Commission has funded studies involving 500 independent research groups over 25 years.  The studies concluded that there is, as of today, &quot;no scientific evidence associating GMOs with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms.&quot;  Indeed, genetic modification can massively increase productivity - by more than 30% - and provide food security for people around the world who desperately need this.  Professor Pamela Ronald from the University of California at Davis, argues that some of the benefits of genetically modified food include massive reductions in the amount of insecticides in the environment, improved soil quality and reduced erosion, proven health benefits to the farmers growing these crops, and their families, as a result of reduced exposure to harsh chemicals, economic benefits to local communities, enhanced biodiversity of beneficial insects, a reduction in the number of pest outbreaks on farms with genetically modified crops and neighbouring farms with non-genetically modified crops, and increased profits for farmers.<\/p> <p>It is argued by Professor Ronald that \"there is now a clear scientific consensus that genetically engineered crops and ecological farming practices can co-exist and if we are serious about building a future sustainable agriculture they must.\"  I think we should be able to debate the issue of genetically modified crops and discuss whether crop productivity can be improved with science.  I am not sure who is right in regard to this issue but we should debate it.  We should not ban such a debate.  Will we debate the issue or take an anti-science stance which poses the danger that our agriculture industry could be left behind?  I mention this issue because it is clear there is an opportunity to develop this area and I think we are avoiding this debate.  The lack of debate about genetically modified organisms and moving to this area means that we are losing out in the agriculture biotech sector where we could create hundreds if not thousands of new jobs if we are open to supporting this sector by making some decisions.  It is strange that we are pro-science in most areas but not in the area of genetic modification.  Given the recent horsemeat scandal, the agricultural sector should move towards more traceability to instill more confidence in the consumer.  I am sure the Minister will tell us we are doing that already.  I believe it is possible to do even more.<\/p><p>Scientific progress and regulation in this area will be beneficial.

If one looks up the word \"sustainable\" in the thesaurus it comes up as green, continual and viable.  The most important word is \"viable\" as a word for sustainable.  That is the theme on which I wish to speak because the viability of farming in what is a new outlook in terms of the schemes includes the new CAP agreement.  We cannot reach a point where suddenly environmental issues mean that farms are no longer viable.  It is important that the Minister continues to support agriculture especially in Ireland where we have a unique situation of the family farm.  We are not into factory farms, such as in parts of the UK, the US and parts of Europe, and I do not think we should ever reach that point.  We all know how valuable is the family farm.  It keeps people in rural Ireland and it keeps people spending money there and in the local shop.  It keeps people supporting the local post office and the local village.  That is why it is important that any sustainable measures put in place must ensure the farm continues to be viable.<\/p><p>One of the most important points in terms of sustainable agriculture was the agreement reached in October with the help of the Minister when the Taoiseach succeeded in persuading his colleagues in the European Council to adopt sustainable intensification as EU policy on agriculture and climate change.  This is important because we have a grass-based system and our greenhouse gas emissions were going to cause us major problems.  The Minister has to work closely with the farm organisations and Teagasc to ensure decisions made in respect of the nitrates directive do not adversely affect the viability of farms.  Another positive development in this and the other House in recent years was the adoption of the EU groundwater directive which provided for septic tank registration.  It is important that all septic tanks are registered to ensure our groundwater is not affected.  For example, in my own County Kilkenny, Glanbia, one of the major co-operatives in the country, received a grant of &euro;13 million from Kilkenny County Council and the IDA due to the fact that it had a source of clean water.  The Belview water supply scheme in south Kilkenny will come into production next year for liquid milk.  <\/p><p>The word &quot;viable&quot; relates to moneys.  The Minister mentioned the downward pressure on milk prices this year and that we may be facing a bill of more than &euro;100 million.  I raised the issue at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in regard to the super levy.  This is an issue we have to look at.  I appreciate that the Minister is in negotiations with the EU and the Commission and, hopefully, we can get a phased payment on this.  This is important given the downward milk prices because cash flow will be a major problem for farmers.<\/p><p>In his contribution the Minister mentioned Pillar 1 and the new changes being introduced, including a compulsory green direct payment which will account for approximately 30% of a farmer's total.  The 30% greening requirements are important for the protection of the environment.  In order to qualify, approximately 10,000 applicants for the new basic payment scheme will have to make changes to comply with the new greening requirements.  It is important they are not tied up in red tape and that we do not have to come here for a debate when the Minister and Senators and Deputies have been lobbied because some &quot;i&quot; was not dotted.  We must ensure these people receive the maximum payments under the scheme.<\/p><p>The GLAS scheme is welcome because farming has been under pressure, especially the beef sector, sucklers and sheep, as 50,000 farmers-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000036#LL00500","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1418226600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>The Senator has 30 seconds in which to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000036#LL00600","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1418226600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>-----will be looked after.

I welcome the Minister to the House.  I will speak predominantly about beef.  Nobody doubts the Minister's commitment to the job at hand and I am sure he is doing all he can.  However, I wish to make a few suggestions about a number of things we should be doing.  As the biggest surplus producer of beef in the EU we should be leading the way rather than following a Europe generated consensus, albeit that we might be feeding into.  The Minister mentioned that the Russian market is closed.  We need to be much more proactive in the context of markets and leading the way.  Instead of France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Italy who have had their own bilaterals in terms of the supply of offal and live cattle, subject to quarantine and a very specific technical system which has been agreed between the Netherlands and Russia on traceability and access to their computers, they are subject to an inspection in the next couple of weeks and expect to be shipping by the end of December.  There is a rumour that France is already shipping but I cannot verify that.  Obviously a huge amount of produce is being smuggled in.  The Russian shelves are still packed with European product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000036#LL00900","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1418226600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>They are only talking about offal.

There are limited markets for offal.  My business pre politics was exporting beef to 46 countries around the world through two BSE crises so I know a little about it but not as much as the Minister with the advice he is getting.  I acknowledge that he is committed to the task at hand but I do not believe we are as focused or as successful as we could be.  Instead of following and waiting for a Europe wide consensus on that issue we should be first in the queue to do a bilateral deal with Russia.  Before Ukraine became an issue, Russia banned 70% visual lean or trimmings manufacturing beef to those who would not understand the lingo.  It banned the whole of Europe.<\/p> <p>Then those self same countries, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, all went off, did bilateral agreements and got derogations on the ban.  Ireland sat on its hands and said, \"No, we better ensure we do not upset our European colleagues\".  We were the goody two shoes and sat back.  Then this possibility was not open to us.  The Ukraine kicked in then.  The Ukraine aside, this is what is happening on offal.  We are not struggling for markets in strips or fillets, in the main.  There is no queue for offal.  The fifth quarter is very difficult to market.  It is a very difficult market to get into.  The Philippines is packed to the hilt.  That is the situation with Russia.  <\/p><p>We need to be more proactive on this.  Mr. Patrick Rogan, the former chief veterinary officer, was much more proactive than whoever is in the role at the moment in terms of, for example, trying to get out onto the market and getting deals done.  On the Department website, there is a market access document, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.  It does not make for great reading.  I forget which country or countries in particular this refers to but when one goes through the document one sees statements such as, &quot;Sent proposed veterinary health certification by email April 2012.  No reply.&quot;  This is not what I would consider proactive marketing.  That is an administrator administrating, ticking a box.  We need more than that.  I know it is not the Minister's personal responsibility to do this and the blame is not on him.  Like other speakers, I have great time for the Minister's approach to many things.  However, he needs more help than he is getting in the context of the market.  <\/p><p>Bord Bia does a very good job.  I have stood with it at stands many a time, at Enuga and elsewhere, and I know the Minister has been at those world trade shows himself, and he knows the difficulties that are there. <\/p><p>We need to be better at niche stuff.  In America, there is a brand called Never Ever.  It positions its products as having &quot;never ever&quot; been treated with hormones and so forth.  The Bord Bia equivalent in America encourages the use of hormones.  We do not.  As the American market opens up, we could beat Never Ever to death because we grass-finish cattle.  <\/p><p>I am nearly finished.

I was very glad to hear him refer to the hidden hunger of nutrient deficiency and the challenge of feeding so many people in the world today.  These are people who do not have enough to eat.  <\/p><p>With 170 million children under the age of five in the world today chronically malnourished, it is appropriate that I take this opportunity to mention to the Minister one of the organisations seeking to address this.  This organisation is being honoured in Leinster House tomorrow.  Mary's Meals provides, in a school setting, 920,000 meals to children in 13 countries across five continents daily.  The Ceann Comhairle will present Mary's Meals and its founder, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, with the inaugural human dignity award tomorrow.  The Minister will be very welcome at this event.  It is appropriate that we note this and that we commend the work of so many good people, in Ireland and further afield, who are working hard to address world hunger and, in particular, the nutritional deficiency that blights so many young lives.<\/p><p>In addition to the appropriate statements on sustainability, it is important that we reflect on the challenges facing Irish farming at home.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the hard work that he and his officials put into the new Common Agricultural Policy agreement.  However, I wish to briefly address some of the issues facing the family farm.  This is the UN International Year of Family Farming.  In the 1971 census, 25% of households in Ireland were headed-up by a farmer.  In 2011, the figure was roughly 6%.  That change reflects the massive decline in the number of farm households over that time period.  There has been a substantial increase in the non-farm population.  Nonetheless, farms and farm households remain central to our rural and national economies and, more broadly, our rural society.  <\/p><p>A recent Teagasc report deals with the variety of problems facing such farms into the future.  These include challenges from the globalisation of food supply chains, national and international policy developments, the end of the milk quota and climate change.  The policy and economic changes ushered in by the ending of milk quotas, difficulty in obtaining credit and the drive towards bigger farms may lead to the end of medium-sized family farms and smaller farms and to the rise of the large industrial-type farming we see in the UK.  This is something I do not wish to see happening.<\/p><p>The dairy sector, from which many of our family farms draw their main income, is by a number of measures our largest indigenous industry.  It has exports valued at &euro;3 billion or thereabouts if one takes into account the breakdown between animal, meat and dairy exports.  The impact of the departure of the quotas on Ireland's dairy sector and its agri-economy will be dramatic.  It is remarkable to notice the difference between dairy production in Ireland and in New Zealand where there is also a grass-based dairy system.  Ireland's dairy production in 2013 was about 5.4 billion litres.  This is roughly the same as it was in 1974.  By contrast, in New Zealand it grew massively.<\/p><p>The growth in milk production will create massive opportunities for some farmers and for large companies and multinationals.  This is to be welcomed and I congratulate the Minister on what he has been doing on foreign investment missions to the US, China, Japan and so on.  However, let us not lose sight of the family farm.  A large expansion is not going to be possible for everyone.  Investment in new land and milking equipment is difficult for smaller farmers, and where there is an ongoing volatility in the price of milk it is going to be even harder.  There is a real question surrounding profitability for smaller farms.  I am worried this may be leading to an expand or die scenario, where large landowners with financial clout will ramp up production.  I ask the Government to prioritise the continuing sustainability of small family farms. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000037#MM01500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1418227200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom aird an Aire a tharraingt ar an ag&oacute;id taobh amuigh den Teach agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtabharfadh an Rialtas aird ar sin.  I know the Minister is a cabinet Minister and it is hard to sit here without noticing the protest going on outside.  I hope the Cabinet takes on board what is being brought forward by the protesters today.<\/p><p>I think sustainability is something of which everybody is in favour, but how to achieve it is a vexed matter when the aims of land use are taken into account.  Meeting our agricultural targets and meeting our environmental responsibilities could result in some hard choices on land use.  Already we have come up against choices and, as 2020 draws nearer, we might have to take decisions which could have serious implications for our agricultural output and our greenhouse gas emissions and about how to offset these, for example by the use of forestry.  If we begin to use forestry in this way, do we damage our biodiversity?  If we preserve our biodiversity, will we limit ourselves in terms of being able to reduce harmful emissions?  Simultaneously, we must pay attention to water quality, protection of species and the maintenance of soil quality, and none of these things can be left on the long finger.  While we are maintaining agricultural production, reducing emissions and maintaining soil quality, we have to be watching the rest as well.<\/p><p>Food Harvest 2020 is beginning to become Food Harvest 2025, as the European Union is developing it.  We should be standing up for Irish farmers in that process, rather than finding in another few years that we are not going to be able to achieve its targets without compromising our agricultural output or biodiversity or some other key factor, just because the Government sat back and let Brussels decide rather than energetically involve Ireland in the formulation of Food Harvest 2025.  We have seen the EU use incentives in seeking to protect our environment with the help of farmers.  It is the farmer, as stakeholder, who is expected to be responsible for maintaining our farmland in its best condition, to be highly productive and also to maintain the environmental quality demanded by the EU, and expected by us too.<\/p><p>We have seen some schemes which have been very detrimental to the Irish farmer because commitments made were not fulfilled.  It would be remiss of me not to bring up the issue of the hill farmers who protested again in Castlebar last week.  They have serious issues on the GLAS agri-environment scheme and the collective agreement being put forward.  I find the Minister to be quite accommodating when it comes to debate.  I urge the Minister to sit down at the table with the hill farmers to try to find a conclusion and resolution to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000037#MM01600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1418227200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I met them last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000037#MM01700","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1418227200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I met them on Friday and they were not happy with the meeting they had with the Minister last week.

They are disillusioned and discouraged from participating in environmental schemes.  The common good is of course served by protecting the environment, and incentives must be designed to serve the common good and support farmers to remain active on their land.  <\/p><p>As has been said, next year we will see the end of milk quotas and predictions are that dairy farmers' incomes will drop by up to 10%.  We share those concerns.  While this is forecast under Food Harvest 2020, we also see plans to expand our dairy herd, which brings us into conflict with the aim of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  We need much clearer action from the Government to address this anomaly.  Our representations and participants in EU negotiations must strongly defend our strong agrifood dependence as an economy and emphasise the successes, albeit limited, achieved in reducing emissions, such as, for example, forestry, clean energy, general awareness of the environment and the need to reduce emissions in farming.  <\/p><p>Ireland's agriculture should be viewed as a valuable resource in maintaining food security for Europe and the Government must argue this point vehemently, rather than allowing greenhouse gas emissions to be the main focus of our position.  It must be possible to work against greenhouse gas emissions without compromising our capacity to be a valuable food producer.  As the world's demand for food increases dramatically, this is our trump card not only for feeding a growing world population, but also for maintaining a rural way of life here based on sustainability and the preservation of the rural traditions which we value as a nation.<\/p><p>The small farmers on the west coast are very important to our economy and to sustaining our communities.

We are in the middle of negotiating the shape and design of GLAS with the Commission.  That is what I said to the people I met last week.

They wanted me to change everything there and then, and announce it, but that was not possible because if I had done it I would have been totally dishonest with them.  I do not know what I can finally sign off on unless and until we get an agreement with the Commission on what we can do in GLAS in terms of flexibilities, towards commonage, in particular.<\/p><p>As late as today, we have a team of people going to Brussels to negotiate on GLAS with the Commission tomorrow.  People need to be patient.  I am on their side.  We are trying to get a flexible scheme that will work for everybody, such as a large dairy farmer in east Cork, a small commonage farmer in west Connemara or a farmer on an island.  I have shown a commitment to those communities which they have not seen before, in terms of top-up payments for islands.  <\/p><p>We are considering trying to allow farmers who have the capacity to grow and expand on the back of market expansion to do that and we are also trying to keep farmers in farming and on the land who might not have the same opportunities in the marketplace by supporting them with strong schemes and supports.  That is what a &euro;4 billion rural development programme is primarily about, namely, trying to achieve that balance as well as ensuring that we do everything sustainably.  <\/p><p>In terms of the new strategy for 2025, it has nothing to do with Europe.  We signed it.  I have asked John Moloney, the former CEO of Glanbia, to chair it.  He has another 27 or so people on the committee, all of whom are Irish stakeholders representing farmers, processors, food business interests, environmental NGOs and so on and who are designing an Irish strategy.  The CAP we have signed off on complements Food Harvest 2020 which, to be fair, was put in place by the previous Government, and on which we have built.  The idea that we are somehow being told what to do by the European Union in terms of 2025 is a total nonsense.  It has no input.  We have to be consistent with the standards that are required under CAP in terms of how we produce food, but we design what we do and how we do it on top of that.  <\/p><p>On areas which have been designated on the back of a hen harrier protection programme - some land has been sterilised on the back of that - I am examining the issue and we will try to develop a support structure which will be acceptable to farmers and landowners dealing with that.<\/p><p>I can assure Senator Mullen that I have no intention, on my watch, of allowing Ireland to move from being a predominately grass-fed family farm system to some kind of Wisconsin factory farm structure.  That will not happen under future Governments either.  Family farm structures are very strong in Ireland.  Land is not often sold outside of the family; on average a field is sold outside of a family once every 400 years in Ireland.  There is a very strong attachment to land ownership and family farm ownership in Ireland, and that will remain the case.  We are encouraging the maintenance of family farm ownership, but with a much more collaborative base for farming.  Neighbours would co-operate with each other.  Partnerships would be considered.  There could be purchasing and producer groups which would collectively represent family farms to make sure they get a better deal in the marketplace and so on.  <\/p><p>We can modernise farming in Ireland, get economies of scale into the system, within reason, and also maintain family farm ownership, which is hugely important in terms of rural society.  I am not sure who said sustainability is also about viability in terms of rural communities, but that is very important in places like west Cork, Galway, the midlands and many other areas, irrespective of whether land is very fertile.  I can assure the Deputy that family farm structures are the basis and heartbeat of rural Ireland as far as I am concerned, and we will maintain and support that.<\/p><p>On the expand or die statement, there will be plenty of dairy farmers who will decide that expansion is not for them.  Such farmers have 60, 70 or 80 milking cows and want to stick with that, which makes sense as a business model for them because of the land and labour available to them, the cost base under which they want to operate and the lack of capital investment they want to make.  That is fine, but the idea that globalisation means lower prices is not true.  We have been operating in a global market for dairy products for the past two years and have had two of the highest years ever recorded in terms of milk prices.  <\/p><p>What will be a feature in the future and what has been a feature for the past number of years is price volatility.  We have seen the upside of price volatility for the past two years and now we are starting to see the downside.  We cannot have it every which way.  We need to insulate, hedge and protect farmers from the peaks and, in particular, the troughs of price volatility.  There are ways we can do that, in terms of longer-term pricing contracts between farmers and their co-ops for a portion of their milk, which makes a lot of sense.  We could set up futures markets for dairy products for co-ops to hedge against price falls.  We have a series of market tools we can use at a European level to intervene when prices are falling rapidly and we need to put a floor on that.  <\/p><p>We can also ask for and insist on a more tailored and improved response from banks to deal with significant price volatility in the context of the repayment of loans and so on.  We are working on things to that effect.  We can do a lot to try to insulate farmers.  It just so happens that this is happening at the same time as we are about to abolish milk quotas.  People who draw parallels between the two happening at the same time misread and misunderstand the market.  <\/p><p>Milk prices have been falling for a number of months not because quotas are going next April, but because we had two bumper harvests internationally and a closure of the Russian market. <\/p> <p>As a result there is a great deal of extra milk in Europe.  We need to understand what is driving the oversupply if we are to arrive at solutions to solve the problem.  <br\/>I take on board some of Senator Marc MacSharry's comments.  I understand the point he makes about Russia, but there is a political judgment call to be made as to whether we should ignore the spirit of the sanctions imposed collectively by the European Union on Russia or to try to do deals.  In terms of activity to find new markets, beef from Ireland is likely to get into the US market in the coming weeks, if not days. Ours will be the first European beef producers to sell into the United States for 16 years.  Ours is likely to be only European beef in that market for the foreseeable future.  It so happens that for the first time ever beef prices in the United States are actually higher than those in the European Union.  Today, we have a team of scientists and veterinarians coming from China to inspect the beef industry, with a view to allowing Irish beef into the Chinese market, the first time European beef would be allowed into that market.  I hope this will happen in the first half of next year.  The two big target markets for us in the past two years have been the United States and China and we are really active in that regard.  Senator Marc MacSharry is knowledgeable when it comes to this area.  There is an offal issue also and I met the Russian ambassador three weeks ago to discuss it.  In seeking new markets generally, we are extremely active and will continue to be because it makes sense to spread risk.  I will take criticism in many areas, but it is unfair to accuse me of not being active in seeking new markets.<br\/>I take on board Senator Pat O'Neill's comments on GLAS.  We need to get it open as soon as we can, but we cannot do so until we get the RDP over the line, or we obtain an assurance from the Commission that we can open a scheme while the programme is still being formally approved.  We are working hard to do this, but it will be the new year at this stage before it happens.<br\/>I take on board many of Senator Feargal Quinn's comments.  He talks a great deal about the Netherlands which in my view is a world leader in linking commercial research, agriculture and food production, but so are we.  In the past three years my Department has sanctioned research programmes to a value of &euro;85 million on the basis of a competitive tendering process to find the best projects across all of the universities and institutes of technology, linking with Teagasc and other organisations.  If one looks at what Science Foundation Ireland is doing, it is putting tens of millions of euro into agriculture and marine projects which are being given greater priority than ever before.  If one looks at the number of courses available in the universities, institutes of technology and agricultural colleges and the quality of the students taking them, men and women, one will see a transformation in the application of science and innovation and new thinking to food production and nutrition and dealing with all of the challenges we face.  That will impact not only on Ireland but also on other parts of the world.  I agree, however, that the Netherlands is a real competitor in this space ad that we can learn a great deal from it.  Fonterra, a company in New Zealand, is hugely impressive in the volume of milk it exports, but in terms of sustainability, Ireland is ahead of New Zealand and I would argue the case with anybody.<br\/>Senator Susan O'Keeffe raised the question of rural communities remaining sustainable.  That is very much part of the broader rural development programme and its objectives.  <br\/>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien raised the issue of fluoridation, one about which I have spoken to her before.  We have made decisions on the fluoridation of public water supplies on the basis of advice from the Department of Health.  It dates back to the 1970s and started as an oral health initiative to prevent tooth decay.  Many families across Ireland have their own wells and it is not a requirement under law to have fluoride in water, but in the public provision of water - a topical issue - the decision has been made on health grounds to apply certain treatments to water to make sure it is safe to consume.  We should assess this issue and look for international experts to assess whether it is still appropriate for us to continue to do this.  I have said this to the Department of Health.  My understanding is that we will look at this issue and seek independent international experts to make recommendations which we will obviously consider carefully.<br\/>I thank Senator Michael Comiskey for his comments on the importance of the beef market and getting new schemes up and running soon.<br\/>Senator Denis O'Donovan called for the establishment of a beef regulator.  With the exception of the ICSA, farming organisations are not looking for this structure to be put in place.  Establishing a new regulator would cost money, money that would otherwise go to support farmers and we would be sending a signal that we had a problem with regulation in Ireland and I am not sure we do.  We have a very active competition authority which is now called the Competition Commission<b>.  <\/b>It has written to me twice in recent months.  There is a fractious and difficult relationship between farmers and processors and we are doing what we can to try to improve it through the beef forum, but what is much more important in my view is that we plan to set up professional producer organisations to represent farmers collectively.  These producer organisations would have the legal right to negotiate on behalf of farmers on price.  That would be much more focused and a much more successful way to improve farmers' negotiating capacity with the factories, rather than establishing another regulator.  I am not sure what needs to be regulated in terms of the information the regulation would legally be able to access.<br\/>We are trying to convince the Commission that the current beef genomics proposals are acceptable and represent value for money as a climate change measure in herd management.  That one can pick a figure and suggest it be &euro;200 per head on the basis of wanting to support the income of beef farmers, with respect is a little na&iuml;ve and opportunistic, given that it was announced, from a Fianna Fail perspective, in the week of the ploughing championships.  Nobody has taken it seriously since because people realise that when the suckler cow welfare scheme was started, the figure was &euro;40 a head, which we doubled to &euro;80 based on beef genomics, and a figure of &euro;100 per head has now been set for the first ten animals.  I would love to be able to have a figure of &euro;200 per head, but we could not do it through a beef genomics scheme; we would have to do it through a coupled payment or other such measures, which means that we would have to take money from another sector, which would not go down too well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000038#NN00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418228400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but I must ask the Minister to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000039#OO00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1418228400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I agree that Europe wide we need to look at the margins for primary producers in the prices offered by the supermarkets in order that they have reasonable margins on their produce.

It is always an important moment when we seek to discuss our culture, because our culture is all about ourselves at work, at play, in protest and at peace.  Since men and women have sought shelter, they have sought to make their mark, to be remembered, to express their views, thoughts, concerns, worries and joys.  Man first put marks on cave walls 40,000 years ago.  They have stood the test of time and are proof that before great stock exchanges or Googles, or even coins or the capacity to buy and sell, existed, there were marks on walls to express ourselves, to be the very basis of our cultural life.<br\/>In Ireland, we wear our culture rather on our sleeve.  We are emotional.  At times we are sentimental.  We love to play music, to sing - I know that is in the Minister's deep heart's core - to talk, and to tell stories.  It is part of who we are and these characteristics define us as Irish in the world.  Celebrating our culture in its many forms is a hugely responsible task because it is fundamental to ourselves.  Being the custodian of our cultural progress is also a great responsibility for any Minister, for any Government and for all of us.  Over the lifetime of this State, which has been short, we are lucky to have put in place such great cultural institutions as the National Library, the National Gallery, the National Museum, the National Archives, the National Concert Hall and the Abbey Theatre.  They have stood the test of time.  They show that we understood from the start that having great national institutions is important to us.<br\/>From there, much more has blossomed - art galleries across the country, musical societies, opera companies, dance, great writings, craft work, poetry and literature.  What an extraordinarily rich country this is when it comes to our capacity to express ourselves and who we are.  We have arts officers working in every county, many arts centres, lots of stages, local drama groups, choral groups and reading groups.  The artistic expression of our culture is alive and well the length and breadth of Ireland, in young and old and in Irish and new Irish communities alike.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, as president of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, can take his share of pride and we should salute him for the effort he has made over many years to bring alive in a new way our great tradition of Irish music.<br\/>I am very proud to be associated with next year's unique cultural celebration of all this and more, Yeats 2015.  I am honoured to be the chair of what will be a year-long national and international celebration of Ireland, of our contemporary cultural wealth and our great cultural heritage, through the prism of arguably one of Ireland's finest writers and poets, William Butler Yeats, whose 150th birthday we celebrate next year as part of the decade of commemoration.  I thank the Minister for being with us to launch Yeats 2015 last week, along with the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  I want to publicly thank her predecessor, the former Minister of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, for supporting the project when it was in its infancy and, like the Minister, seeing the benefit of celebrating Yeats and the crucial role he played in Irish history as well as Irish literature, and in the formation of Ireland's cultural identity at the turn of the 20th century, when so much was in flux and so much was at stake.  I also thank the steering group which has worked with me during the past 12 months to help deliver what promises to be an exciting and varied programme across the country and across the world.<br\/>The vision we set down is to celebrate and commemorate the life, work, influence and achievements of William Butler Yeats through an engaging, celebratory and cultural programme.  It will showcase Ireland as a dynamic, inspiring and creative place.  It is not simply about a commemoration, it is much more than that.  It is also about celebrating, and about being inspired by what inspired him.  It has been difficult at times, because our ambition far exceeded our pocket, but it has not stopped us, I hope, believing in the value of celebrating Yeats and our culture.<br\/>Next year should provide a genuine opportunity for the nation to pause and re-evaluate our own cultural milieu - our relationship with ourselves, so to speak.  It comes before another great year, 2016, when we commemorate and remember the 1916 Rising.  Although not stage-managed by Yeats himself, who was just lucky to have been born 150 years ago, next year's anniversary gives us an appropriate opportunity to pause, but to do it through our cultural means, rather than perhaps through a more political prism.  There will be a chance, I hope, to celebrate, to have fun, to see some great paintings, and hear good music and beautiful poetry, but it will be more than that.<br\/>At its heart, Yeats 2015 proposes to be inclusive.  For far too long, Yeats was placed on a great, high pedestal - hard to reach and often out of touch.  On Yeats's Day, which we launched in 2012, we have always made a point of including young children, older people, students excluded from school, sport and food.  Wherever we can find a way to include people, we have sought it.  We have aimed to show that this great writer, like all great writers, is not above us.  Yeats never set out to be above us.  He battled all the time to draw people into the debate about Irishness and our great cultural heritage, how to articulate a pride in that heritage and Irishness, and how it was rooted in our fables and our great mythology.<br\/>Next year also offers that opportunity, which is important as we embrace new communities into Ireland and recognise and acknowledge their cultural contribution.  Scholars and academics have pored over his every word and writings.  They have, perhaps, unintentionally created a situation where people who love just a small amount of his poetry may feel embarrassed to say they love &quot;The Lake Isle of Inishfree&quot; or &quot;The Cat and the Moon&quot;.  It is not about knowing all of his work.  It is about appreciating and loving what one does know and saying &quot;Next year, I'm going to enjoy the bit that I do know.&quot;  In that way, everybody - from young to old and from scholar to the child reading their first poem - can enjoy it.<br\/>There is also the opportunity to reconnect with the identity of the nation at a time when we have endured much and when there is much to look forward to.  The programme of events next year - poetry, music, dance, song, readings and performance, held underground, in schools, in halls, in libraries and on boats - is there for everyone to enjoy.  We call on everyone to get involved, whether they want to organise something themselves to celebrate or to come and share one of the celebrations we are organising, and to see it as a year for all of us to enjoy.<br\/>Our great young people are so open to their artistic and creative instincts.  They are the treasure of our future and they need to be nourished and nurtured.  I welcome the arts in education initiative operated between the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills under its director, Dr. Katie Sweeney.  There are genuine plans to change the landscape for arts in education through many routes: Music Generation, the mapping exercise, which will single out and show where the practice is both good and poor and needs to be improved, the launch of the arts rich schools programme, which will encourage all schools to build arts into their school day, and an online portal that is currently in development.<\/p> <p>In a way, these are the areas where the real changes will occur - with young children - and help to stop the arts from being the preserve, possibly, of the wealthy and the middle class, as has been the tradition.<\/p><p>Research carried out in the United Kingdom and elsewhere demonstrates the tangible benefits of expanding the arts.  Up to now the lack of evidence has been one of the great difficulties of investing.  The arts have always been the poor relation.  Indeed, the only way to change this is to invest at the core level and in schools.  The research showed that being involved in the arts can improve the cognitive abilities of children.  There are links between the arts and better health.  Students from low-income families who take part in arts activities are three times more likely to get a degree than students from low-income families who do not take part.  Drama and library activity improves attainment in literacy.  There are positive impacts for people with dementia and Parkinson's disease if they are involved in the arts.  Then, of course, there are economic benefits in attracting visitors and revitalising places through artistic and cultural activity.  The Arts Council in the United Kingdom has identified that this investment has the capacity, in a way, to create the right lens through which the transforming ghost of art that is everywhere, but is often invisible, at last shows up as an identifiable presence.<\/p><p>Before the Chair axes me with his hammer, I will make a final point.  I recognise that the Minister has negotiated some additional funding for our institutions and I know she is aware that the state of funding could be described as perilous.  Those involved in the institutions work hard.  A particular challenge facing the National Library of Ireland, among others, is the fact that it has been unable to recruit staff in recent times.  The library is keen to organise a national cultural repository to serve as a storage facility in the future in order that we can treasure the marks on the wall, as it were.  However, without funding it will be unable to do that, and much of what is now digitally available will be lost if we do not have a strategy in place.<\/p><p>I would be remiss of me to leave out the heritage sector, which oversees monuments, parks and wildlife and our national reserves.  These are part of the extended fabric of our culture.  I recognise that there is much to do and it is a great responsibility.  I thank the Minister again for supporting Yeats2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000040#PP00400","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418229600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to the House again, having already briefly spoken.  The motion on culture and the arts in Irish society put forward by my colleague Senator O'Keeffe is important.  I pay tribute to Senator O'Keeffe for her immense hard work and perseverance in getting Yeats2015 off the ground.  Those of us who know Senator O'Keeffe will be aware that it is no exaggeration to say that she lives, breathes and sleeps Yeats2015.  It is a tremendous testament to her doggedness, if I may use that term, to see it getting off the ground.  I commend the Government on supporting and building Yeats2015.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for her support for the initiative.  I attended the launch last week at the Dublin United Arts Club.  There is a considerable level of participation in this initiative by Departments, agencies and so on, as well as cultural and academic institutions and many individuals.  As Senator O'Keeffe said, they are keen to mark 150 years since the birth of the former Senator William Butler Yeats.  Those of us in the House remember him especially for that reason.  Yeats2015 will be a year-long festival involving many constituent elements throughout Ireland and internationally.  I commend Senator O'Keeffe on her great work on the festival.<\/p><p>Of course, the motion is about more than Yeats2015.  It is also about recognising the critical role of culture and the arts in Irish society.  I am pleased there is no amendment.  We can all gather and agree our support for the motion, because it is very much about a collegiate approach to the arts.<\/p><p>As Senator has said, we have a vivid cultural and artistic wealth.  I will comment a little more on culture and heritage because I know Senator O'Keeffe did not have time to do so.  I will also comment on the arts and arts funding.  I am pleased that we will have funding for the commemoration programme.  This will be put in place in the coming year and as we go into 2016.  Our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, will have a large role to play in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator O'Keeffe referred the initiative of arts in education and the Arts in Education Charter.  These are of major importance and I believe we will see a major return in terms of educating children in the arts.  In particular, we will benefit from the commitment of the national cultural institutions to the effect that students will visit those institutions at least once in their second level career.  Furthermore, the Arts Council will introduce the national Arts-Rich Schools scheme and so on.  These are all important initiatives at a time when we are seeing serious cuts in funding for the arts.  Of course, that is an ongoing problem.  The Arts Council grant-in-aid was reduced to &euro;56.9 million in 2014 despite the fact that an Indecon report from 2011 showed the considerable economic benefits provided by the arts sector, quite apart from the considerable cultural richness and social and community benefits that the arts and heritage provide.<\/p><p>I wish raise the matter of funding for the Heritage Council, which was reduced by 72% between 2008 and 2014.  Perhaps the Heritage Council is sometimes overlooked when we are debating arts, culture and heritage.  However, as the Minister is well aware, the Heritage Council carries out important work, particularly in small and rural communities throughout Ireland.  I know from colleagues who work in this area that the cuts have impacted on their professions, which include conservators, thatchers, ecologists, archaeologists, museum curators and other specialist professions in the area.  Yet the Heritage Council carries out important work, including high-quality advice to the Minister and as well as the development of many aspects of our heritage infrastructure, such as the Irish Landmark Trust, the county heritage officer network, Woodlands of Ireland and so on.  A great deal of work is undertaken by the Heritage Council, yet it has a rather modest budget and, I understand, only 14 staff.  I understand that in the short term a grant of &euro;750,000 for 2015 would support 150 community groups in the undertaking of heritage projects which would help to build community engagement, positive action and social capital at local level.  I wish to highlight the work of the heritage sector, which is sometimes seen as the poor relation of the arts.<\/p><p>The problems we see with resourcing are not confined to the Heritage Council.  In recent weeks the National Museum of Ireland has been in the news because of a shortage of money and suggested closures.  I have been working with the Minister and her office to try to ensure the full opening of the galleries in the Natural History Museum.  It is a very important institution, particularly for schoolchildren.  They are fond of what we all know as the dead zoo.  We need to ensure that funding is kept at an adequate level for all of our museums and galleries.<\/p><p>I have not had time to discuss the visual arts, but we are all mindful of the important work done by the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Hugh Lane Gallery and the other visual art galleries.  I thank the Minister for her support for Yeats2015 and I remind her to remember the Heritage Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000041#QQ00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1418229600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire anseo inniu.

I know that with her passion and vision it will be particularly successful.  That event of itself is an indication of what we have to celebrate in our midst, and people are always waiting for an opportunity to do so.  They are waiting for the associated leadership as well.<\/p><p>One thing that is particularly significant about artistic life and culture is that it is very much part of our community.  Let anyone go down to a local community where there is an art exhibition by a local artist.  He will see the venue packed.  If a choral and dramatic society puts on a local drama, there is always a full house.  This is an indication of the community relationship with culture and art.<\/p><p>Even in the most difficult and challenging of times, if we have iconic figures in the world of music, literature or art, there is no doubt they help us to get over those challenging times.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that they help us to get through these challenging times because, first and foremost, we realise there is a particular spirituality in art and culture.  It inspires and tells us that no matter what challenges we face, we can overcome them.<\/p><p>I am often surprised that when we go looking for elements that bring people together and lead to reconciliation, we miss out on culture.  I attended the Fleadh Cheoil in Derry which was attended by an immense number of people - 430,000.  I visited the Waterside to meet and make a presentation to loyalist bands.  I learned a very good lesson from them.  I was urged to listen very closely to the music being played because, in many cases, the only difference between it and Irish music was the name of the tune being played.  That is an indication of where one can go with culture.  <\/p><p>I was delighted to travel to Northern Ireland last week on the invitation of the loyalist bands.  I also visited the Ulster Scots centre where I realised how much we had in common.  I realised that if we could get away from megaphone diplomacy and start to highlight the elements which united rather than divided us, we would be amazed by how much there was.  That is true not just in political life but in all aspects of life.  That is why it is important at all times that the State is supportive of our culture and the arts.  Not only are they good in inspiring us individually, they also have given us status internationally.  We have been successful in many spheres but particularly in the spheres that last, namely, literature, music and the arts.  For a small nation, we genuinely seem to be punching above our weight.  We should not talk about cultural tourism in an economic sense only because there is more than economics involved; it is chiefly about interacting with others.  Often people of different nationalities come to visit Ireland and the one thing that makes us comfortable with each other is our culture.  One cannot argue that one culture has supremacy over another.  I have always found that people involved in the artistic world invariably have respect for every art form and culture.  In fact, they see other cultures as enriching their own.<\/p><p>I am looking forward to the commemoration of the 1916 Rising.  It is not necessary for us to highlight what it should entail.  I have always referred to the Rising as a poets' insurrection because at its heart were poets, teachers, writers and musicians.  This is replicated in many other countries which have sought or are seeking independence.  Many of those involved in the Rising were prolific writers and artists.  There are so many areas from which we can draw and that we can make central to the commemoration.  I have listened to people from other countries talk about what they learned from the 1916 Rising which I have always said represented right over might.  Those involved did not aim to dominate anybody else and Ireland never colonised another country.  That is why our art, culture, poetry and music should be central to the commemoration in 2016.  <\/p><p>We should not be over-cautious for fear of causing offence to people in Northern Ireland.  I have referred to my experiences with loyalist bands and the Ulster Scots Association and believe if it is understood, they should celebrate their traditions.  If we are generous in accepting this, I have no doubt that they will see our commemoration of the 1916 Rising in exactly the same way.  The Minister has a daunting task ahead of her because there are so many strands to culture and the arts and it will be a challenge to bring all of them together.  That said, it is interesting that a fabric has been developed.  The important point is that each strand should be able to identify itself within that fabric.  <\/p><p>I attended the Fleadh Cheoil in Sligo and, as is the case with all Fleadh Cheoil venues, the strength and richness of the styles of music tend to rise to the top.  That is exactly how it should be because in any art form or aspect of culture if uniformity dominates, the creative spirit of the individual is killed.  It is important to allow art to be free flowing and flexible because, above all else, we are talking about individual artistic expression.  The importance of this debate lies in the very fact that it is happening.  We discuss agriculture, sport and so many other areas, but there is always a danger that in a busy legislative House, the art and culture which have inspired us during the years will not receive the recognition they deserve.  That is not true in this instance because we have had many debates and discussions about the arts and culture.  It is probably the least divisive issue in the House and le c&uacute;namh D&eacute; that will continue to be the case in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000041#QQ00300","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418230200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  This is the second time in as many months that we have discussed this subject.  I welcome the motion tabled by Senator Susan O'Keeffe on behalf of the Labour Party and I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.<\/p><p>At &euro;74 million, the level of Government funding for the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2015 will be the same as in 2014.  Given that there are so many demands on the Exchequer, the fact that the Government has maintained this level of funding is welcomed by those involved in the arts community.  The Minister has just contributed &euro;178,000 to the music capital scheme which will allow young musicians and music groups to purchase new equipment.  I also note that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport recently announced a fund of &euro;2 million for festivals in 2015.  Included in this sum is &euro;1 million for the St. Patrick's Day Festival, which is very welcome.<\/p><p>It is obvious that the Government recognises the significance of having a vibrant arts and culture sector.  The arts play a very important role in communities and reach out to people from all walks of life, demonstrating a very strong sense of social inclusion.  Participation in the arts and sport is particularly important for children as such participation improves self-confidence, interpersonal communication skills and self-esteem.  Cultural events bring life to villages, towns and cities.  Festivals and cultural events attract tourists from all over the world and boost the national economy enormously.  Last year the Government supported approximately 120 festivals all over the country which employed almost 8,000 artists.  These arts festivals contribute to the national economy, as well as to local communities, with beneficial knock-on effects for local businesses.  The Galway Arts Festival, for example, contributed &euro;21 million to the local economy in 2013.  Cultural tourism, therefore, is a huge business.<\/p> <p>The latest development of the east coast tourist trail from the north-east Boyne Valley all the way down to Wexford and Waterford is a living history project animating the culture and heritage of our country. <\/p><p>We are renowned all over the world for our culture and our artistic achievements, both past and present.  Our famous writers and poets, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, Oscar Wilde, Brendan Behan - I do not know if the Minister saw the fascinating documentary about him on television the other night - Anne Enright, the late Maeve Binchy and John McGahern, to name a few, bring huge international respect and admiration to these shores.  Last year, 13 writers were nominated for the Man Booker prize.  Three of these were Irish - Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, Donal Ryan and my good friend in New York, Colum McCann.  Two Irish writers - Niall Williams and Joseph O'Neill - made the list this year.  That says something special about this wonderful country of ours.  Irish artists are known and admired all over the world and our musical heritage is legendary too.  From The Chieftains to my favourites, U2, Riverdance to the Abbey Theatre, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, young Saoirse Ronan - all were born, bred and produced right here on these shores.  This is something of which we should be very proud.  <\/p><p>The year 2016 will be an important year in Ireland, with the centenary commemorations of the 1916 Rising.  We have spoken about this in this House already.  This commemoration will provide us with a golden opportunity to attract huge, if not record, numbers of visitors from overseas, replicating the success of The Gathering.  Approximately 3.6 million tourists come to Ireland for a cultural experience.  This centenary celebration is an ideal platform to engage more with our diaspora and the over 60 million people throughout the world who proudly claim to be Irish or wish they were.  <\/p><p>I commend Senator O'Keeffe as chair of the Yeats2015 initiative.  We have spoken a number of times about this project.  She and her committee have worked tirelessly to bring this project, and her vision to honour W.B. Yeats, to fruition.  She deserves the support of Government, philanthropy and the corporate and community sectors.  Yeats2015 will be a great celebration of W.B.'s work and the inspiration he has given and continues to give to this day.  It is a unique opportunity to celebrate our former Senator and poet, one of the most influential figures of 20th century literature.  Let us not forget that it is 92 years ago this week that W.B. Yeats was nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann by the President of the Executive.  We celebrate that fact this week.  We should all work together and get everyone involved - our schools, communities and cultural institutions - to attract as many visitors from home and abroad to take part in Yeats2015. <\/p><p>I emphasise that on a global scale, the arts, culture and creative sectors play a major role in our economy and towards our international reputation.  This can never be underestimated.  Ireland must continue to make its presence felt through continued investment.  From a social perspective, we want to encourage, educate, develop and produce here at home the next generation of artists who will follow in the shoes of W.B. Yeats and others aforementioned.  I thank the Minister for her presence here today and wish her the best of luck. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000042#RR00200","speaker":"1165","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418230800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Labour Party Private Members' motion on Yeats2015, as well as the importance of arts and culture in society.  I was delighted to attend the official launch of Yeats2015 last week, in the United Arts Club, with the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Senator Susan O'Keeffe, chair of the national steering committee for Yeats2015, Professor Meg Harper from the University of Limerick and acclaimed artist Olwen Fou&eacute;r&eacute;.  There was a strong contingent from Sligo and Leitrim at this event.<br\/>Yeats2015 is a year-long celebration and commemoration to mark the life, work and achievements of W.B. Yeats on the 150th anniversary of his birth.  Yeats is unique, not only as Ireland's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, which was awarded on this date in 1923.  He was also a figure of the time in which he lived, which shaped this island as much as it shaped his writings.  He lived during the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence and was at the centre of the cultural wing of the emerging state.  He co-founded the Abbey Theatre which opened its doors in 1904, drove the Irish literary revival, also known as the <i>Celtic Twilight<\/i>after Yeats' collection of 1893, and served as a Senator for two terms.  It is also important that we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of this great man in the context of the decade of commemorations.  His poetry has inspired us all and has left a lasting impression with artists, musicians and academics across the world.<br\/>I would like to congratulate Senator O'Keeffe and the steering committee for driving this important initiative forward and I look forward to the exciting programme of events that are planned over the coming year.  I hope these celebrations will encourage members of the public to rediscover the work of Yeats and to reflect on a fascinating period in our history.  I am pleased that my Department provided funding of &euro;500,000 to this important initiative, as part of a wider allocation of &euro;22 million for a number of flagship commemorative projects.  Yeats2015 provides a wonderful opportunity to showcase Ireland as an inspiring and creative place, and to illustrate to the world how utterly proud we are of our literary heritage.<br\/>I was recently in Atlanta and New Orleans for the International Famine Commemoration and while I was there I had the pleasure of attending events honouring two other giants of Irish literature - Heaney and Beckett.  It would be hard to overstate the esteem in which these Irish literature greats are held in the United States and internationally.  Yeats himself was very much aware of the potency of Irish writing.  I was at Emory University which has some of Yeats's papers.  The university is very proud to have these writings and original first editions of some of Yeats's books.  It is not until one goes abroad that one realises how important these people are and how proud the Irish are to have this connection back home.<br\/>In reply to letters of congratulations on being awarded the Noble Prize, Yeats wrote, &quot;I consider that this honour has come to me less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature.&quot;  As Senator O'Keeffe has stated, we should be inspired by what inspired him.  <br\/>Tonight&rsquo;s motion provides an opportunity to recognise the contribution and impact Yeats&rsquo;s life and work has had on this island and beyond, and also to recognise the hugely important role the arts generally plays in our society.  Our culture and our identity are intrinsically linked.  To many people around the world, to think of Ireland is to think of Yeats, Beckett and Joyce.  Since my appointment, I have been making a big effort to get out in local communities to see the huge impact the arts is having in every town and village across the country.  I have a great appreciation of how the arts can reach out to people and how cultural expression can interpret and aid understanding.  <br\/>The arts greatly enriches people's lives &ndash; both young and old.  Artistic endeavour can provide a positive outlet and a great source of joy for both participants and observers.  The arts draw people together in towns and village across the country and bring communities to life.  My vision is to support the arts, at both national and local level, in a meaningful and lasting way.  Improving access to the arts, culture and our rich heritage preserves our identity, enriches our society and helps promote Ireland&rsquo;s image abroad.  It is also vital for our economy.  As I have said in this House before, countries which invest in the arts are progressive and successful places.  I believe investing in the arts is a prerequisite for a prosperous and happy society. <br\/>Since 2011, despite many challenges, over &euro;540 million has been invested in the arts, culture and film, with &euro;138 million being allocated during 2014.<\/p> <p>More than &euro;56 million of this was allocated to the Arts Council, which supported 143 festivals across all art forms, 470 arts organisations and 532 individual artists across the country.<br\/>Ireland's cultural and creative industries play a major role in defining a positive image for Ireland at home and abroad.  Their contribution to improving cultural tourism should not be underestimated.  Over 2.4 million tickets were sold for arts venues throughout the country in 2013.  There were more than 14,800 arts events in 2013 and more than 3.6 million visitors to the cultural institutions funded by my Department.<br\/>Like every State body, the national cultural institutions have had to endure significant reductions in financial allocations over the past few years as a result of the economic crisis.  The cultural institutions have worked tirelessly to minimise the impact of the cuts and maintain visitor numbers to the greatest possible extent.  Many, if not all, of the institutions have carried out staffing and operational reviews to examine how they can achieve optimal performance.  It is a testament to their efforts that over 3.6 million people visited cultural institutions in 2013, an increase of 4% over the previous year.  In the recent budget I was able to maintain funding for 2015 for the cultural institutions at the same level as 2014.  This brought an end to the cycle of unavoidable cuts that have taken place at all of our cultural institutions in recent years as the Government worked to rebalance the public finances.<br\/>Over the past number of months I have been engaged in discussions with the chairs and senior management of a number of our cultural institutions, including the National Museum of Ireland, about addressing ongoing funding challenges.  I was delighted to be announce last week that I had secured an agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to provide an additional &euro;2 million to the national cultural institutions as part of the Revised Estimates to be published later this month.  This funding will give more certainty to the institutions and will allow them to continue to deliver on their core objectives while attracting large numbers of people through their doors.<br\/>My priority is to protect services and access for the public at the cultural institutions.  I want to work constructively with the institutions in achieving this aim.  Our national cultural institutions are an essential component of our cultural fabric.  Through their collections, exhibitions and work with young people, they make a huge contribution to our society.  The additional funding demonstrates the Government's commitment to the national cultural institutions.  I hope that as the economy improves it will be possible to further reduce resource constraints on the institutions in the future.<br\/>Senator Bacik mentioned heritage.  She is not present, but I can confirm that I have a great interest in heritage.  I was a member of my local heritage group and also served on the County Monaghan Heritage Forum.  Heritage is so much a part of what we are.  I fully recognise the great work done by the Heritage Council, and it is worthy of our support.<br\/>The Government has prioritised a number of capital projects at our cultural institutions.  The historic Dargan and Milltown wings are being refurbished at the National Gallery of Ireland at a cost of &euro;32 million.  This two-year project will create almost 300 construction jobs and is expected to be completed by 2016.  This will bring the gallery back up to international standards and allow it to present world-class exhibits in a world-class setting.  A major &euro;4 million refurbishment was recently completed at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham premises of the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  The refurbishment has brought the institution up to international standards.  When I visited it in August, I was very impressed by the galleries.<br\/>Funding has been allocated for building development works at the National Archives<b><i><\/i><\/b>on Bishop Street.  The project will address the long-standing problems associated its storage conditions.  It is anticipated that construction will begin in 2015.  Similarly, funding has been approved for a significant renovation project at the National Concert Hall as part of the decade of centenaries celebrations.  This project involves the renovation of the Kevin Barry room, which is long overdue and will serve to substantially improve the facilities at this much-loved venue. <br\/>Earlier this year, additional funding of &euro;22 million for 2015 was secured for a number of flagship commemoration projects.  These include the GPO interpretative centre, Kilmainham Courthouse and Gaol, the Military Archives, Teach an Phiarsaigh in Ros Muc, the Tenement Museum, Richmond Barracks, and redevelopment works at the National Concert Hall.  Each of these projects will deepen our understanding of the history of that period and will provide a permanent tribute to those involved in the Rising.  They are also a key component of Ireland 2016, a national initiative led by my Department to mark the 100th anniversary of 1916 in an inclusive, appropriate and respectful way.  This programme will be underpinned by the &euro;4 million I secured in the recent budget, which will be used to roll out an integrated plan during 2015.  The allocation will support a wide range of activities and events by interested groups, including local community groups and the arts community.<br\/>Local communities are at the core of what I want to do, and I have already met all of the city and county managers and the local arts and heritage officers.  I want them to support and encourage local communities to get involved in Ireland 2016.  I want children and young people to be at the centre of how we celebrate 2016 and I will work with the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss what can be done to promote schools programmes.  A public consultation process is under way to encourage and facilitate ground-up initiatives, and I look forward to hearing the ideas and suggestions that emerges from this process.<br\/>I note the reference to an Arts in Education Charter in the motion tabled this evening.  The Arts in Education Charter is a joint initiative by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I have met the Minister for Education and Skills on a number of occasions to discuss this initiative in detail.  We are both very keen to progress implementation of the charter.  I firmly believe that immersing schoolchildren in the arts through a targeted strategy will produce huge benefits for future generations.  It gives young people a greater understanding and appreciation for the arts as they progress to adulthood.  An implementation group, chaired by Professor John Coolahan, meets regularly.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives, including increasing the number of artists in residence in colleges and developing a portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.  <br\/>Another important priority for me is to deliver Ireland's first national cultural policy.  Last June, an agreement was reached to draft a national cultural policy called Culture 2025.  It will set out the high-level aims and policies in the area of culture for the period up to 2025.  This is the first time in the history of the State that a Government has undertaken such an endeavour.  My department is finalising a draft discussion paper.  I will initiate a wide-scale consultation process early in the new year to ensure all can make their views known.<br\/>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned his visit to Northern Ireland for the Fleadh Cheoil and how music transcends all boundaries.  Of course I would claim that it was the Cavan Fleadh that widened the definition of traditional music.  Cavan, with the benefit of PEACE funding, was able to bring in traditional music from different traditions and communities.  That legacy lives on.  Last August or September I attended the launch in Cavan of a CD compiled by musicians from a traditional Irish background and from Protestant bands.  It does one's heart good to hear them all play music together, and at the launch the room was filled with fabulous music.  On that occasion I thought to myself, &quot;This is what music is about - bringing people together.&quot;<\/p> <p>I just wanted to mention that.<\/p><p>I very much look forward to the programme of events for Yeats2015.  As we look back on the 150 years since the birth of Yeats, we also have an opportunity to look forward.  I hope Yeats2015 will act as the perfect precursor to Ireland 2016, when we will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, while asking ourselves where we want to go in the next 100 years.  It is a great opportunity to look forward, evaluate and consider the future.  I am always encouraged by the great sense of enthusiasm, passion and appreciation in the Seanad for the arts and I am sure I will work with many Members in the coming year to commemorate and celebrate the life and works of one of Ireland's great literary figures.<\/p><p>It is an honour and a privilege for me to serve as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and I believe we are entering an exciting time for the arts.  As the economy improves, I will fight for increased resources for my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000043#SS00200","speaker":"973","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418232000,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

I am not disappointed that this is the second time we have debated them in two months; rather, I am delighted because the arts are often forgotten, given all of the other issues raised.  This is a very important area.  Many years ago W. B. Yeats sat in one of these seats and a moment ago I found myself wondering which one.  Given the ruaile buaile outside Leinster House earlier, I wondered what type of poetry he would write today.  What would he think of today's protests?  I was sent a random text earlier containing a quote by him and, apparently, he held journalists in significant disdain.  He said: &quot;I hate journalists.  There is nothing in them but tittering, jeering emptiness... The shallowest people on the ridge of the Earth.&quot;  It is obvious that even in those days Senators had interesting relationships with representatives of the Fourth Estate.<\/p><p>I welcome the Yeats2015 initiative and commend all involved for their work.  Yeats had a strong connection with County Galway in places such as Thoor Ballylee and through his connection with Lady Gregory of Coole Park.  I have spoken to local people who are concerned that insufficient time was given for funding applications and that Galway people were overlooked in the funding process.  I am not sure that is correct, but it is important that Galway-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000045#UU00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1418232000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>It is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000045#UU00300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1418232000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Is it not?  The Senator can clarify the matter when she sums up, but it was brought to my attention today.  Yeats had a huge connection with Galway where he wrote two collections of poetry, The Tower in 1928 and The Winding Stair in 1933.  <\/p><p>On the broader motion, the arts in education charter is to be welcomed, but, as mentioned, the document needs more work.  I always have problems with the notion that artists should work for free.  When artists were given grants in the past, numerous Governments, not just this Administration, seemed to think they should also give classes in a school as part of the gig to justify the grant.  They should be respected in their own right.  I, therefore, question the notion of asking them to work free of charge in schools, as alluded to in the arts in education charter.  The document should be redrafted annually and we should build on basic principles.<\/p><p>The Arts Act needs more work.  The Minister has said she has spoken to county managers about introducing things to local areas, but local authorities should place greater emphasis on development of the arts.  To do this they need more support and funding.  I know that in my area the small amount received is stretched far and that incredible work is done.  I understand arts funding in Galway County Council and Galway City Council has been cut every year for the past six years and that they have found it difficult to continue.  Better recognition of the work of local authorities is required such as the fact that they manage, support and run venues.  They need more funding to support local artists.<\/p><p>The festivals mentioned are extremely important to local communities because they attract people to an area and ensure it has a vibrant, expressive nature.  However, the arts have been commodified and annexed by tourism, to an extent, because it seems as though everything is measured by the number of hotel rooms filled as a result.  The celebration of arts at a local level is a celebration of creativity and bringing people together; therefore, the communal nature of art should be recognised in its own right, without excuses and justifications.  It is important that there be an economic impact, but we should not have to justify artistic activities in these terms.  More support should be given to festivals, nationally and locally.<\/p><p>The engagement of young people, especially those between 17 and 23 years of age, is very important because we often hear them complain about having nowhere to go.  The pub is usually the only option, even for those involved in music.  The music generation initiative was very good and sponsored by a number of vocational education committees, VECs.  Apparently, some of the projects that could have applied for funding through that initiative which sought to promote music do not have a funding organisation behind them and I call on the Minister to examine this issue.  Can support be given to music generation projects that are coming to an end?  They may fall by the wayside because they are not supported locally by a VEC.<\/p><p>Poets, artists and dreamers are central to the commemorations, but I am not sure whether a major art work has been commissioned for 2016.  It is important that the Government recognise this and consider commissioning an artwork such as a statue to commemorate past events.  I agree that arts policy must be developed in collaboration with other Departments.  The Department of Health does a lot of work with older people and those in certain residential settings and there could be scope for important collaboration in this regard.  Education and the arts go hand in hand and work can be done on this aspect.  From a social inclusion perspective, the Department of Justice and Equality could engage with the arts.  There are such collaborations and it is important that they continue.  Perhaps each Department might have a policy on how to engage with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the development of the arts.

The Minister is in office at an interesting time for the arts, given that Yeats2015 was launched last week and that we are on the cusp of a new year.<\/p><p>In many ways, the arts and culture equate to people's identity.  Self-actualisation begins when one can express oneself through and experience the arts.  Many needs must be taken care of before one can enjoy oneself at this level.  I will focus on Yeats2015 and Thoor Ballylee.  I am chairperson of the Yeats Thoor Ballylee Society which was founded recently.  It started its work in July or August 2013 and its goal is to reopen Yeats's ancestral home of Thoor Ballylee in south Galway in time for what would have been his 150th birthday on 13 June 2015.  This is an ambitious project as Thoor Ballylee was closed in 2009 owing to severe flooding that saw the bottom floor of that impressive building flooded above the height of the T&aacute; and N&iacute;l signs in the Chamber.<\/p> <p>We have now accepted we cannot necessarily prevent the flooding of Thoor Ballylee but our goal is to reopen it and move the artefacts, etc. to the second floor.  I do not know if the Minister has been to Thoor Ballylee but it is well worth going.  It is quite a big building.  It is a tower and was Yeats's living quarters.  One can see how inspirational it was.  The vantage point over south Galway is impressive and links to Lady Gregory's Coole Park and the nearby Kiltartan Gregory Museum.<br\/>I have written to the Department seeking a meeting with the Minister and my one request is to have it soon.  For us to achieve our goal of restoring, reopening and running cultural and educational programmes in Thoor Ballylee we are looking at &euro;1 million.  We need &euro;150,000 by next June to reopen it and it is our intent to have it.  We have just hired a fund raiser and she is putting together a vision statement and a master plan.  I am working closely with her, as are other members of the committee like Ronnie O'Gorman, and Sr. de Lourdes Fahy, who published and launched <i>Galway Poems of WB Yeats<\/i>last Friday in Gort, which includes 20 of his best known poems, including <i>The Winding Stair<\/i>and <i>At Galway Races<\/i>.  It is a lovely pocket sized version containing 20 of his poems.  Yeats said he felt he wrote much of his best poetry in Thoor Ballylee.<br\/>We are closely linked to Sligo and the story of Yeats in 2015.  Senator O'Keeffe visited us at one of our committee meetings in Gort.  It is very impressive to see the energy in the group.  The council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Galway Rural Development, the local community, and Ronnie O'Gorman and I are all involved.  We have written to President Higgins to ask him to launch the project in June.  We are focused on making this happen at a date suitable to the President because I am sure he will be busy with dates for Yeats in June.  We will leave that up to him.<br\/>We are also looking at launching a local, national and international fund raising programme to raise the money.  My request to the Minister is to arrange a meeting with a delegation from the group as soon as possible.  The father or grandfather of Sr. de Lourdes Fahy used to drive Yeats, others knew him and there are long family links to him in this area of south Galway.  I am hoping for people to have an open mind about having Thoor Ballylee as an important place in the Yeats story.  I express some surprise that it was not built into some projects that have been funded and were announced last week, given that it is such a seminal building in the story of Yeats's life.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister with regard to date for the meeting.  January would be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000045#UU00500","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418232600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators and the Minister for a healthy conversation.  It is always good to have culture and the arts discussed in the House, which has a long tradition of being interested in and caring about this sector.  There is much work to be done, particularly with Thoor Ballylee as Senator Healy Eames has pointed out.  It would be terrific if we can manage to get it open and is one of the major challenges that faces the Minister in terms of how to restore and retain the monuments that are part of our heritage in Ireland.  Thoor Ballylee is a gorgeous place and I want to set at rest the mind of Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that we took advice about advertising for the cause of giving funding.  We contacted every arts officer in the country to make sure people knew about it and we had close to 150 applications for funding.  They were not based on bed nights but purely on the cultural benefit and capacity of any of the projects to match the criteria laid down, none of which had anything to do with bed nights although the economic impact of any activity must be borne in mind.  However, this was not part of the Yeats fund.  Galway has been represented on the steering group, particularly in respect of Thoor Ballylee and Senator Healy Eames in funding.  We are trying to create a Dublin Galway Sligo triangle, although geographers may argue about the shape.  When people come to Dublin, I do not want them to think that it is a long way to Galway or Sligo.  I want them to think that Yeats was part of all these places.  He belongs to all of us but he particularly had an interest in those three places, lived there and much of his work was influenced by his associations there.  We must take responsibility to encourage visitors out of Dublin and make it worthwhile.  This is what we would like to see as a legacy.  We must hold hands with each other and collaborate as three counties that have a particular interest and can encourage others.<br\/>With regard to the wild Atlantic way, we are looking for layering, a point about which we have spoken to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe.  The cultural pieces of the wild Atlantic way is one element of legacy work.  <br\/>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh did not read this quote: <blockquote>A statesman is an easy man, <br \/>He tells his lies by rote; <br \/>A journalist makes up his lies <br \/>And takes you by the throat;<\/blockquote>Members can take their pick as to which one he least liked.<br\/>I thank President Higgins, who is the patron of Yeats 2015.  He is on a state visit to China and has taken WB Yeats on the tour.  He will be talking about Yeats and the cultural links between China and Ireland tomorrow.  It is an opportunity to show that we have links and that we can use our cultural links across the world.  It is one of the pieces that is very important.  I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and our great ambassadors.  Each and every one of them has shown personal interest and desire to be involved way above the normal duty of wanting to do the job.  This is about wanting to take hold of the project and engage with local communities.  I commend them on that and I also commend the Western Development Commission, which is the lead authority on this.  Incredible work has been done in organising this and keeping us on the right track.  It is a good collaboration for an organisation that is not one of the agencies under the Minister's umbrella.  It is part of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and shows that, when needed, the Government can do the right thing rather than thinking that it ought to belong somewhere else.  I wanted to make sure the Western Development Commission was the lead authority because it has an interest in the creative life of the west.  Much of what Yeats did, what he was interested in and what he was inspired by was in the west.  We should not be afraid to say that.<br\/>Senator Eamonn Coghlan had some gracious words.  I do not know if he is organising the 5,000 m Yeats race and I have not heard him mention it.  I must speak to him about it.  Next weekend, the Arts Council will announce a laureate for Irish fiction.  What a great moment it will be, with 34 Irish writers, from William Trevor, who has been winning prizes for the past 60 years, to Eimear McBride, who was a prizewinner in the past 12 months and won the Yeats Cup for poetry when she lived in Sligo.  She will be one of our guests of honour on Yeats day.  Another member acknowledged that Deputy Humphreys is the Minister at a great and interesting time.  We have seen some of the expenditure and investment that will take place and there is a great legacy to be taken from it as we begin to appreciate much more the correct and right role of the arts and our culture.  I would hope that in ten or 20 years time Senators standing here will not be saying that the arts are a poor relation but that they are a vibrant part of our lives.  All of us look forward to assisting and feeding into the Minister's 2025 plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000046#VV00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418232600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.\r\n\r\nSitting suspended at 6.25 p.m. and resumed at 7 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Standards of Care in Residential Care Homes: Statements","time":1418233200,"counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000047#XX00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1418233200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the opportunity to speak on this issue.

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff.  The mistreatment highlighted in the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme is very disturbing and needs to be fully investigated.  In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to place a number of staff off-duty while the allegations are being investigated.  I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents.<\/p><p>I also welcome and support the HSE's initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations, chaired by Mr. Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility led by Dr. Kevin McCoy.  I have been fully briefed by the HSE since it became aware of these allegations and I have asked it to ensure that all appropriate resources are put in place to ensure that the safety and care of residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta is maintained at the highest possible standard.  I have also asked the HSE to brief me on the outcome of these investigations as soon as possible.<\/p><p>I have been assured that the HSE's priority is to protect the very valuable services that people residing in &Aacute;ras Attracta receive as a critical support to them and their families.  I am aware that the HSE has contacted families of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta offering to meet with them.  I would encourage families and concerned members of the public to contact the HSE's information line at 1850 241 850 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Saturday.  The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance.  In this respect, I understand that the director general of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.<\/p><p>The HSE is also considering initiating its own undercover investigations into operations in HSE facilities to supplement the programme of inspections already in place and as part of a suite of measures it is developing to protect vulnerable people.  In addition to these initiatives, the HSE's new national policy and protocols for safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse, which I launched on 5 December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals.  This new policy, which came into force on Friday last, with immediate effect, places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a designated officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse.  Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people.  In each community health care organisation, a safeguarding and protection team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed.  This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres for people with a disability and is very welcome.<\/p><p>I also welcome the public appeal made by the chief executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA.  He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA's significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities.  I am very conscious that the events we witnessed in the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme yesterday happened in the home of these vulnerable individuals.   It is incumbent on us to do everything possible to remind the management and staff of our services of that fact and of the need to maintain high standards of ethical behaviour and apply the training and principles of person centred care in everything they do.<\/p><p>I doubt there is an individual in the country who was not disturbed by what we saw last night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000047#XX00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1418233200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>We were all shocked to the core by what we saw on television last night.  Most of us do not watch much television, but last night's programme was what one might call \"reserved viewing\".  Nothing prepared me for what I saw last night.  I know a little about this sector as my wife is a nurse and works in a residential care home and is well used to dealing with individuals with disabilities or challenging behaviour.  Not all of those in &Aacute;ras Attracta have challenging behaviour.  From my little knowledge of the issue, the challenging behaviour displayed seemed to result from the way the residents were treated and the failure to communicate with them by staff.  The lack of communication is often the reason for challenging behaviour. I was shocked to my core, as was everybody in the country who watched the programme.<\/p><p>I never saw such a reaction to a TV programme - on Twitter, on Facebook, talking to people, meeting people, etc.  What we saw was appalling, shocking and completely contrary to human decency.  I was tweeting during the programme and in one of my tweets I said I felt a bricklayer would handle his bricks more carefully than these special women were handled by some of the staff.  Their treatment was outrageous.  The Minister mentioned that this happened in their home.  This key point was forgotten, namely, that this happened in these people's home.  They should be treated as if they are at home and people are well paid to do their job of care.  We acknowledge staff have suffered cuts, but theirs is not a bad job.  Many people are trying to get into nursing and care services and it does not take a huge amount of professional training to know what not to do in this situation.<\/p><p>I have a number of concerns.  Last night after the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme I watched the discussion, during which the Minister of State said she could not give any assurances that this is not happening elsewhere.  She must be able to give these assurances.  We need assurances that this is not happening elsewhere.  We also need immediate action from her.  There must be immediate implementation of the current HSE proposals to ensure the system is operating as it should.  One of the big concerns is the pre-announced inspections being undertaken by HIQA.  These tend to wind the staff up and put them in a panic about HIQA turning up for the period of time it is there.  Everything, of course, will be all right on the day.  If visits were unannounced and if HIQA could show up unannounced at any time, people would be aware of that and work on that basis.  The way the system operates currently is that the announced inspections do not benefit residents or service users at all but just put stress on staff.  This needs to change completely.  We need a change of mindset so that we know what is happening.<\/p><p>The undercover actions and secret cameras were essential to what was uncovered and shown on TV last night.  Thank God for the people who did that difficult job.  I pay tribute to the RTE researchers involved.<\/p> <p>There are issues of privacy involved here.  I know that RTE had to seek the permission of all the families involved and I am sure it was a big ordeal for them.  The Minister of State needs to be able to give people assurances.  She needs to do everything in her power, as does the HSE, to make sure that this type of behaviour is not happening in other care homes.  Clearly a disgusting culture developed in that place that allowed such behaviour to happen and that allowed people to be treated as less than human.  It was truly awful.  <\/p><p>I have some other concerns too.  Whistleblower legislation was passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas recently which provides that guidelines will be drawn up for staff in the public sector on the implementation of the law in terms of blowing the whistle, so to speak.  What has happened in that regard in the HSE?  Has the executive issued guidelines to staff?  Have the voluntary bodies that run similar care homes issued guidelines to their staff?  If people want to blow the whistle on bad practices today, what should they do?  Who should they ring?  What is the procedure?   While somebody like Mr. Ryan who sent a dossier to the Committee of Public Accounts would, as a senior civil servant, be well-versed in the provisions of legislation, the average nurse or care assistant is too busy to read the Protected Disclosures Act.  They need to have a simple way of blowing the whistle.  I suggest that a hot line be set up immediately so that nurses, care staff or anyone else with an interest can blow the whistle on bad practices.   Such people need to be able to ring up and give information, whether to the Department or to the HSE.  That information could be critical, dignity saving or even life saving.  I would also like the Minister of State to come back in due course and give us an update on the Garda investigation into the activities at Swinford.  If an assault were to take place outside the House today, those involved would be arrested immediately and rightly so.  The same should apply here and I would urge the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to adopt a similar proactive approach in the case of &Aacute;ras Attracta.  I wish the garda&iacute; the very best with their investigations.<\/p><p>These events have also sullied the name of a great Irish women who is not very well known; St. Attracta who ran a hostel for vulnerable people 1,500 years ago.  Her memory has been sullied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000047#XX00300","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418233800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for making time today to deal with this issue.  The television programme aired last night was frightening.  People are shocked that in this day and age this way of managing patients was allowed to continue.  It is interesting that HIQA carried out an inspection of the facility on 25 and 26 February and again on 26 and 27 May this year.  Several issues were identified by HIQA and the indications were that not everything was running as it should be.  This shows clearly that where concerns are raised, making sure that the checks and balances are operating properly is essential.  It is clear that the management and care of the patients was not being carried out in proper manner.  It is also very clear that there were no checks and balances to ensure that proper procedures were being followed.  That is a significant issue.  Surely the medical staff working at this facility must have been aware of concerns.  When patients attend GPs in the context of family difficulties, doctors can often identify issues of concern, particularly with children.  What was the position at the facility with regard to medical care?  Was the medical well-being of patients being reviewed on a regular basis?  If not, why not?<\/p><p>This raises another issue which I have been highlighting repeatedly over the past six months and which came to the fore again last week at the meeting of the Committee on Health and Children which addressed the ambulance service.  At that meeting, senior management confirmed that they did not have the skills to carry out the work they were employed to do.  They spoke about inadequate job descriptions.  About six months ago I raised my concerns about the fact that more than 1,100 staff in the HSE have been appointed to more senior roles without being interviewed.  The HIQA report on the ambulance service also raised the issue of staff not having the requisite skills to do their jobs.  Given that 1,100 people were appointed without interview, is there now a question mark over whether they have the competence to carry out their roles?  Does this also apply to this area?  It is fine to put people into jobs but it is important to ensure that they have all of the necessary skills to carry out the job they are employed to do.  Certainly in this case, the staff obviously did not have the skills to manage these patients, which resulted in major failings in their care.  If they were trained, was that training adequate?  If they were not trained, how were they appointed to their jobs?  These questions must be answered.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000048#YY00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1418233800,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

Her family, however, can speak and have spoken at length to me.  She cannot talk and is totally dependent on her carers.  She is doubly incontinent and her seizures are life threatening.  Her blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and she needs to be near a hospital.  However, the bungalow, which is in Nurney, is 45 minutes away from Naas General Hospital, the closest source of oxygen.  She is not under nursing care but is looked after by carers.  She lived with her family until 14 months ago.  Her family is great - her Mammy, Daddy and three fantastic siblings have all helped to care for her.  She is now 17, a year away from being an adult in the eyes of the State.  She is a beautiful lady but only weighs 65 kilograms.  Her family reached the stage where they needed respite and the HSE took Cliona to assess her and placed her in a private nursing facility.  She never had a single injury while being cared for by her family but has had four injuries in the past 14 months.  She broke her toe and while she had trouble walking before that, she can barely walk at all now.  She strained ligaments in her ankle.  She fell the other day and injured her neck.  She fell against a radiator in the corridor outside her room which is unsafe.  She split her lip and was taken to Naas General Hospital but was deemed not to need plastic surgery.  She is disfigured for life.  I am not, by the way, making any allegations here.  I will leave that to the Minister of State's imagination.<\/p><p>Imagine being Cliona's mother.  She is very beautiful - I have a picture of her here.  Her mother was promised that a male would never be in charge of Cliona.  She needs her nappy changed in the middle of the night and care throughout the night.  We have found out that three times a male carer was left in charge of this young lady.  How does the Minister of State feel about that?  Her mother is terrified and appalled.  Her mum and dad visit her regularly although her placement is a 120 km round-trip from her home.  The only quality of life for this young lady is seeing her family, whom she adores.  She recognises them, loves them and they are the only thing she has.  She left her little cuddly toy behind in the car one day and her parents drove 15 minutes back to the lovely bungalow where she lives, her room done up by her mum.  The carers had the kitchen door shut and were drinking tea while their little girl was unsupervised.  Need I say any more?  <\/p> <p>This evening I spoke to her sister, who is a doctor, and she said she had serious concerns about Cliona's welfare and safety.  The HSE officer responsible for the Leinster region - I will not give her name - is, I believe, engaging in a form of abuse against the family.  It is not just the child about whom we are talking but five adults in Templeogue who are broken people.  The child had to be moved from Crumlin because she was becoming an adult and on 9 July the consultant at St James's Hospital said that, in his opinion, her current living circumstances needed to be reviewed from a safety perspective, as she was living with a very serious medical condition in a social model of care without nursing care.  He stated she needed nursing care and needed to be moved.  It is only by raising the issue here that I have forced the HSE to attend a meeting with the consultant next week.<\/p><p>I could go on, but this cases mirrors what we saw on television last night and I am just one person dealing with one local in my area.  I need the Minister to intervene personally and do something for this family before Christmas, preferably tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000048#YY00500","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418234400,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to discuss this issue.  I proposed an amendment to the Order of Business this morning.  Last night I deliberated long and hard as I knew there would be repercussions and I did not do it lightly.  I felt something had to be done and I was very disappointed - I still am  - that not one other person in the Chamber seconded the amendment.  We can all talk about how we tweeted about it and raised it on Facebook last night; we can all talk the talk, but we really need to do something about it.  Yes, we are all shocked; everybody is shocked by what he or she saw, but we need to move to do something about it.<\/p><p>Last week it took a death close to Leinster House to have something done about homelessness.  There was a death in &Aacute;ras Attracta in 2012.  I ask the Minister to, please, ensure there is not another one before something is done.  Looking at the programme last night - we do not need to go back over it again - the hitting and the physical, psychological and mental cruelty were shocking.  A manager walked in and sat on somebody and the reaction of the girl in question was to go back over to him.  This shows the loving vulnerability of the patients, which is replicated throughout the country.  <\/p><p>It was said to me this morning that I was emotional.  Yes, I am personally involved and have somebody involved, but I am also deeply concerned about all of the others throughout the country.  I have been inundated with calls from people who are upset and who, like me, have family members in care units, but I have also received calls from people who have no knowledge of what is going on.  It is welcome that there are investigations, but I ask the Minister what is their timeline.  We can talk the talk, but there is a need for urgent action.  I dread to think of what things will be like for anybody who will be in respite or residential care tonight. <\/p><p>I have no qualms about the staff who look after my son.  The vast majority who work in this area are absolutely beyond reproach, as we all know.  It only takes two or three rotten apples to totally decimate the service, but it is not working.  It is frightening that HIQA gave &Aacute;ras Attracta a clean bill of health in May and here we are a couple of months later.  I assure the Minister that this is replicated all over the place.  <\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke asked how the people concerned were working there.  I would like to talk about a service in which last year it was decided to cut all meals.  When I asked what would happen to the kitchen staff, I was told they would be okay, that they were all going to have a carer's role.  That was grand, if they wanted to perform that role, but they might have been taking on a role to which they were not suited.  I am absolutely sure that whoever is there is making it work, but perhaps there are people in these roles who were deployed from other areas and do not want to be there.  Last night we saw people who obviously should not have been in these roles.  In my book, they should have been arrested today and have criminal charges brought against them.  I say this publicly.  What is being done?  Why are they still on a salary?  I know everybody needs to look at it fairly, but based on the television programme, something really needs to be done.  <\/p><p>We need to have complete confidence that the most vulnerable are totally safe when in residential care.  We talk about the new standards and so on, but, as I said this morning, the only way forward is to have a independent review.  We do not need people associated with the HSE involved in this review, no matter how good or half impartial they are.  We need those compiling the report to be completely independent of the HSE in order that parents can have complete confidence.  I ask that this work continue on Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day and throughout the Christmas period.  We will be finishing up next Thursday, which is one of the reasons I brought up the matter this morning.  This issue is going to be kicked to touch and people will say, &quot;Oh yeah, we will have a debate on it.&quot;  As I said, I cannot go home thinking we had an opportunity to do something but did not take it.  In my naivety I came here this morning thinking people would be so horrified that the whole place would be seeking action.  Unfortunately, it is not.<\/p><p>It is greatly upsetting that only 2% of the services investigated are fully compliant.  We are talking about whistleblowers and people reporting wrongdoings.  On the programme last night we heard two people discuss a former employee who had reported abuses and their reaction was that it was brilliant that they had got rid of her.  I was speaking to somebody today involved in a similar case who had worked in a service and reported bad practice with her colleagues and who had been bullied out of the place.  We cannot let this go on.  We can talk about standards, but we really need to put them in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1418234400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I am supposed to call the Minister of State at 7.25 p.m.  The Acting Leader has indicated he might extend the time allotted for statements.

Our job in opposition is to hold the Government to account and make sure failings are articulated.  Part of my contribution will involve that aspect, but before I go on, it is important to say there is no excuse whatsoever for what we saw on television last night.  The behaviour of some of the staff at the care facility was absolutely unacceptable and there can be no justification or excuse given by anybody for what happened.  The question we have to ask ourselves is why must the voiceless in care depend on whistleblowers or unannounced HIQA inspections or RTE's \"Prime Time\" programme to expose what we have known for some time - that some of those who work in care homes and other facilities engage in wholly unacceptable behaviour?  Not so long ago we had a very similar programme about a creche, a point which needs to be taken on board.<\/p><p>I understand the frustration expressed by Senator Mary Moran.  A half hour debate is not enough, but whether we debate the issue for half an hour, an hour or two or five hours is not the issue.  The issue - Senator Mary Moran touched on this - is what are we going to do.  What actions are going to be taken from all of these debates?  What new methods, training programmes and management oversight arrangements are going to be put in place to deal with these issues?  One thing is absolutely certain: the job for those involved in caring for people with intellectual disabilities, older people or children is extremely demanding and difficult.  I could not do it for love or money; I just would not be able to do it.  It is very difficult and people need to be trained to do it.  A certain type of person is needed, somebody who has empathy and compassion and can show love.<\/p> <p>A certain type of person is required to do that job, somebody who has empathy, compassion and love.  That is the reality.  However, they also require training.  This is very simple in some respects.  We can over-complicate it but ultimately we need the right people with the right temperament in the right jobs.  There must be proper training, management structures and proper oversight mechanisms.<\/p><p>I read the Minister's speech and I apologise for my absence for part of it.  What steps will the Government and the HSE take on this?  Steps must be taken to ensure that the highest standards are understood, in the first instance, and implemented by those we trust to look after these defenceless people.  That is at the heart of it.  These people are incapable of voicing or giving expression to the treatment they are subjected to, and the uncertainty causes great fear for families, parents and siblings.  My grandfather was in a nursing home for years and received very good treatment.  However, I am sure all public representatives have been approached by people from time to time to complain about how their older loved ones were not properly cared for.  These are real problems and they are happening not just in this care setting but everywhere.  However, that is not to taint everybody, because the vast majority of people who provide the care are providing the best possible care.  They are wonderful people who do a wonderful job.  Nevertheless, those who are not must be rooted out, and that can only happen if the proper resources, management structures, oversight and follow-through are in place.  We can have inspections but the follow-through is important as well.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to have this brief debate and I look forward to the Government taking action on this issue, which is what we seek.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000049#ZZ00600","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418235000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>The one question that concerns all of us as parents is what will happen to our children and how they will be looked after when we are dead.

It is not a matter of training somebody to tell them that one does not sit on top of a patient, drag them around the floor or force feed them.  That is not about training, that is about how one treats another human being.  I have been involved with the domestic violence issue and the type of treatment I saw last night strikes me as much the same.  We tend to blame the HSE or its accountability, but the animals who performed in that manner in the programme last night - I can term them as nothing else - unfortunately have the protection of things such as the Haddington Road and Croke Park agreements.  The only thing those people should get today is a P45.  They should be out the door and down the road.<\/p><p>It is not acceptable practice.  They are people with responsibility who are being paid to do the job.  Their treatment of the clients was absolutely appalling.  Those are the only words that can be used.  The Garda might well conduct an investigation as the clients were assaulted, but I believe it is a P45 situation.  One gets rid of such people, makes an example of them and starts again.  What are the solutions?  Must we have cameras monitoring places such as this with some type of oversight whereby they would be monitored appropriately by somebody in that setting?  Unfortunately, we might have to do that.  Not everybody could monitor that, but I believe that is the required solution from the HSE's perspective.  There should be an appropriate monitoring body to monitor these facilities.  That is the only thing that will satisfy parents so they will know their children are safe.  Their children can range in age up to the mid-70s.<\/p><p>I have been speaking at length about the domestic violence issue since the 1960s, but unfortunately not a great deal has changed in mental health institutions since the 1960s.  However, all of these actions are carried out by human beings on other human beings.  As I said, I listened to the general secretary of the psychiatric nurses union yesterday and his biggest issue was that there was a lack of clinical governance in this case.  It transpired that he had worked there himself.  As I listened I wondered if this fellow was for real.  What clinical governance?  Will somebody tell the person that they should not do that?  The person should know they should not do that anyway; they should not have to be trained not to do it.  It was the greatest cop-out I have ever heard, instead of criticising some of the union's members and those who were not its members for that behaviour.  There were five or six people working in this place at any given time other than at night, which would be normal.  There were plenty of staff but the problem was their behaviour.<\/p><p>The only way to deal with this is to have them gone very quickly and teach them a lesson.  We can start from there.  I will give the Minister whatever support I can.  There are parents throughout the country shaking in their shoes today after seeing that performance last night, because one can be sure it is not just happening in one unit, unfortunately.  The employees in these facilities need to know that if they are caught, they will be treated appropriately with every measure of the law and lose their jobs.  That is final.  There is no excuse for these people coming back into any other part of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000050#AAA00200","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"speech","time":1418235000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

I share all the anger that has been expressed.<\/p><p>I heard it being described as a level of care.  It is not care at all, but a level of abuse.  The word &quot;care&quot; does not enter into it.  I listened carefully to my colleagues who have first-hand experience from a service user's point of view and the level of concern, annoyance, anger and frustration in their voices must be taken on board by everybody.  We cannot quantify what the difficulty is in our services but we have to think that the overwhelming majority of people working in them are decent, hard-working people.  That point cannot be forgotten.<\/p><p>We must approach this in a cool way, despite the level of anger we justifiably feel.  I was a little concerned to hear in the early comments from Pat Healy, Tony O'Brien and the Minister on the programme, and the Minister also mentioned it in her statement here, about initiating undercover investigations.  There probably is a role for undercover investigations, but not as a first response.  I caution against going down this road.  As a health care professional one works as part of a team.  The nurses, doctors, care assistants, art therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapist and many other therapists are professionals and must work together as a team.  If there is a feeling among the team that one person is there solely to find fault with everybody else, it will undermine the work of the team.  That will be the unintended consequence of what we are trying to prevent.  I caution against this as a first response.<\/p><p>I recommend that we set up a proper peer advocacy network.  I have said this in the House several times.  It should be underpinned by statute, be fully funded and provide 24-hour accessibility.  This is what we must do.  It is a difficult thing to do.  It will be a hard job and expensive, but having watched the programme last night I doubt that any money would be poorly spent in this regard.  Peer advocacy is the way to go.<\/p><p>Senator Mulcahy rightly spoke about governance.  He might have been a little unfair to Des Kavanagh.  I listened to the same interview but I did not have his interpretation of what was said.  However, I accept the point he is making, which is that without character and temperament one cannot train people to be anything.  This is first thing an interview is for, and I was shocked when somebody said earlier that many of the jobs in the HSE are filled without any interview.  That is absolutely scandalous.  If people do not have the required temperament and character, they have no place working in the caring professions.<\/p><p>This is a very difficult time for the Minister.  People are struggling with the issue and demanding immediate answers.  Unfortunately, it will take some time to put in place the proper structures to ensure that the most vulnerable people across the entire range of services are fully and properly protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000050#AAA00300","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1418235000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's visit to the House at such short notice.

We cannot train people to care and to love.  It is a natural instinct.  If people do not have those basic, fundamental qualities they should not be in the caring profession.  We must not put those type of people in charge of our sick, our elderly and our children.  That is not the job for them.  I do not know the reason such people take up these jobs if they do not have that natural caring instinct.  I know because I was in the caring profession, and I loved it.  There is a vulnerability and an innocence about the people.  Some of them suffering from Alzheimer's disease do not know their own children when they walk in the door.  All one wants to do is hold them and hug them, and one has empathy for them because of that.  To see a grown adult crying because his mother does not recognise him is heartbreaking.  If someone does not have that basic, fundamental quality of compassion, these institutions are not place for them.<\/p><p>The Minister might update the House on the progress of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill and the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.<\/p><p>We must learn from this, and we must do something about it.  We must also be cautious about installing cameras in such care homes.  We have to respect the residents' rights and their privacy.  Where would such cameras be installed?

We must preserve their dignity at all costs but must it always take someone from the media with a camera to go into these institutions and highlight what is happening?<\/p><p>Senator O'Brien has highlighted a complaint but I got a letter today, as I am sure did all Senators, from the Ombudsman telling us that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000051#BBB00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1418235600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Already been there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000051#BBB00400","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1418235600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>-----he will investigate any complaints.

I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House at short notice.  It is critical that all the people at home tonight who are wondering if their loved ones are safe in their particular facilities know that the fact the Minister of State is here tonight is a start in restoring confidence in the service.  We must do everything possible to allay any fears people may have about their loved ones who are in the care of others because what we saw last night was shocking beyond belief.  What is really worrying is that nothing appears to have been learned from Leas Cross and all the other facilities in which there were problems over the years.  We must carry out the investigation quickly, and appropriate action must be taken against anybody found to have misbehaved or ill-treated any person.<\/p><p>I said on the Order of Business this morning that there were two problems, first, bad management of the facility and, second, the recruitment process.  What sort of interview process recruited those people who were incapable of delivering the type of care and service required by those vulnerable people?  We need to examine our selection processes if they fail us as badly as they have in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  As Senator Colm Burke has been highlighting here, it is frightening that people are being appointed to positions within the Health Service Executive without having the necessary skills or going through the selection process we expect.  That issue must be dealt with.<\/p><p>The run-up to Christmas is a worrying time for everybody but the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Department must ensure that an audit is done as quickly as possible of all the facilities in the State on an ongoing basis to ensure that the level of care we should be providing is being provided.<\/p><p>I join with all colleagues in condemning what we saw on the programme last night and I hope this is the last time we will have to discuss this issue in the House of Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000051#BBB00700","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1418235600,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I thank my cousin and esteemed colleague for sharing time with me.  The Minister of State is welcome.  It is difficult to imagine how one can take something positive out of the dire and disturbing set of revelations that has emerged.  During a brief period of my life I taught social care on a social care programme in the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and one of the buzz phrases that came up time and again was the notion of a reflective practitioner - somebody working in the area of social care being reflective on the job and how he or she does the job.  The other concept I remember was that of avoiding models of care that were oppressive.  What we have seen are sad examples of practitioners of social care who are not reflective, and have not been reflective, and social care that has been oppressive.<\/p><p>All of us are far beyond the stage where we believe there are only good people and bad people or that institutions are made up of only good people or bad people.  We are beyond the stage of thinking that everything was great in the past - we know it was not - and that everything is rosy now; we know it is not.  What we can say, however, is that we must first ensure that the law applies where people have committed an offence, whether it is withholding knowledge or whatever.  What has come forward in this documentary constitutes evidence, and that evidence has to be used in the appropriate way by the civil authorities in the context of criminal investigations.<\/p><p>Second, we have to recognise that care plan norms only go so far.  We need people who have a sense of ethics.  There was a time when we would talk about basic Christianity.  We can use a wide phrase but the idea of loving and caring in a special way for the most vulnerable has to be recovered, and one cannot just learn that in a college course or through a box-ticking exercise.  We must get back to the concept of ethical treatment of other people.<\/p><p>I will leave the Minister with a positive comment, and I thank her for her indulgence.  In the same place in Swinford something very positive is happening.  A new treatment for autism, the rapid prompting mechanism, RPM, is being practised and explored by families and it has been a liberating experience for children with autism who are now enabled to communicate their feelings.  A child describing how he felt before using RPM said he was terrified but now that he can express himself he now describes himself as liberated because he can communicate his ideas and feelings.  Not everybody we are talking about has autism but I suggest this is a very positive development that I have already raised in this House with the Department of Education and Skills.  We could have the Department explore what can be done to assist children with autism who might benefit from the rapid prompt mechanism system of treating autism.  It is very exciting for the parents and families involved, and for the teachers involved.  How ironic and instructive that it should be going on in Swinford among other places.  I ask that that issue would get attention in these days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000051#BBB00800","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1418235600,"counter":416,"content":"<p>In terms of those who stood and watched, what the Senator spoke about used to be called sins of omission.  That is part and parcel of the new document on protecting vulnerable adults.  There is a reference in that document to omission and being witness to something that is wrong.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Mullins, I believe we have learned something.  I have learned something from this entire process.  We were a country that denied everything.  Once it happened in an institution we denied it.  It did not happen, and we continued to deny it until it was undeniable.<\/p> <p>I do not intend to do that.  It has happened.  Hand on heart, I cannot tell Senator Byrne that it is not happening in other centres.  I would love to be able to confirm that for parents, siblings and families who are seriously worried about their loved ones.  I cannot, however.  It would be false and unwise for me to do that.  The only comfort I can give is that we will do our very best to ensure what we saw last night is unacceptable.  I take Senator Gilroy&rsquo;s point that not everyone working in this area does what we saw last night.  With the level of interest today, a clear and strong signal needs to be sent to those working in the area that the type of behaviour we saw on last night&rsquo;s programme is not just unacceptable but will not be tolerated.<br\/>When Senator Moloney made her contribution, I smiled because I recalled she worked closely with a particular trade union.  Recently, a social worker in the Baby P case in the UK won a substantial award in court because due process was not followed in her dismissal arising from the case.  We certainly do not want to give anyone involved in this case an excuse.  There are three ongoing investigations.  As a result of one of these investigations, we will determine what the disciplinary measures will need to be.  Whatever the recommendations are, they will be followed.  As we speak, the Garda is already examining 190 hours of video material it is received from the programme's makers.  We have requested the material ourselves but I am not certain we will get it.  Mr. Christy Lynch has personally written to the programme&rsquo;s producer seeking the material too.<br\/>The HSE, Health Service Executive, has set up a special helpline, similar to the one for reporting cases of elder abuse.  Working in close proximity with people can make it difficult for nurses and care workers to challenge their colleagues in certain circumstances.  However, when they go home, they can pick up the telephone or drop a line to report abuse.  Not acting is no longer an excuse and certainly not acceptable.<br\/>For 20 years I have been listening to those who deal with people with intellectual disabilities on the need for an independent inspection regime of care homes.  We introduced that regime which is now over a year old.  HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority, would never have picked up this type of behaviour.  If we are sensible and have any experience of the world, everyone knows the minute someone highlights such behaviour, be it a family member, care staff or HIQA, the behaviour will change.  We do need an additional suite of measures.<br\/>People working for too long in the same setting can lead to familiarity.  As we know, familiarity sometimes brings contempt.  We need to ensure more of a flow in staff.<br\/>HIQA made 59 recommendations for &Aacute;ras Attracta which were all implemented.  Up to 400 additional hours of training were put into this centre.  I agree with Senator Mulcahy on this business of properly trained staff.  We are talking about five qualified nurses and care assistants with qualifications up to FETAC level 5.  That is not substandard training.  Perhaps people make the wrong choices when it comes to whatever section in which they want to work in the health services.  It is still no excuse.  If one feels one is in a job that one does not like, especially when dealing with vulnerable people, then there are other areas of the health service that could do with one&rsquo;s help.<br\/>While I cannot say, hand on heart, this behaviour is not happening elsewhere, the clear signal needs to be sent to the wider system that it is not acceptable.  I hope people will take account of the new whistleblower legislation.  Maybe we have not been forward enough in this regard and need to have a publicity campaign to reassure people that if they come forward with information on such behaviour, even anonymously, then it will be acted upon.<br\/>This is such a serious issue that the more we speak about it and the more it gets out to the wider system, the more protection will emerge.  I am not certain we will ever be able to say that every single care unit of the 900 in the country is entirely safe, however.  All we can do is our very best that it does not happen.  What is interesting is that type of behaviour was not going on in the other bungalows in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  I think it was familiarity and the through-flow of staff is important.  In mental health, we have been trying to get those working in acute units to work in the community for a time and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  This ensures a free flow and turnover of staff to allow them to understand when someone is admitted and discharged.<br\/>I received several calls today from families who entrusted a family member who they love very dearly into what they thought was a good care setting.  They informed me they will visit more often now and do so unannounced.  A locked door is no excuse.  There should be no locked doors.  Some units may require a locked door for residents who may wander or harm themselves but these are very few.  As for challenging behaviour from the ladies on last night&rsquo;s programme, I would be challenging myself if I were treated like they were.  I did not see any behaviour that could not be dealt with properly.  As we speak, there is already a team of three experts in this area dealing with that type of behaviour in &Aacute;ras Attracta and giving the new staff the necessary type of training for them to properly deal with those with challenging behaviour.<br\/>I knew of this for the past two weeks.  It is not as if when it was reported that nothing happened.  It happened instantly.  The Garda was informed and has an investigation under way.<\/p> <p>HIQA was informed and the HSE has a service improvement team in place as well.  We are working hard on it.  As Senator Gilroy rightly said, it is not a time for knee-jerk reactions.  I agree with Senator Gilroy completely in that regard.  Certainly, we need to do more than we have been doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000051#BBB00900","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418236800,"counter":419,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000053#DDD00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1418236800,"counter":420,"content":"<p>At 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000053#DDD00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1418236800,"counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000053#DDD00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","time":1418236800,"counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000053#DDD00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1418236800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000053#DDD00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1418236800,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being in the House this evening.

Bush would call a bathroom break.  The Minister knows what this motion is about.  Serious concerns have been raised in the media and by others about the award of contracts for the provision of information technology services to the group of hospitals in the HSE north-west region recently.  The group has been rebranded Saolta.<br\/>It has been reported that a contract to provide information technology for patient care management, among other things, was awarded to Northgate Public Services, a British company.  The value of the contract has not been disclosed by the HSE.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>has reported that a senior member of management with Saolta was previously a consultant with that company.  The contract is presumably valuable given that it covers the major hospitals in the north western and western region.  It is also clear from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>report in question that Northgate was the only company invited to bid for the contract.<br\/>The Minister is well aware that we have had a problem previously in respect of this hospital group and tendering for contracts, specifically in the context of a report on maternity services.  In that case only one party was invited to bid and the successful party had a connection with the then chairperson of the west north-west hospital group.  The consultancy was called D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership.  It was awarded the contract and the then chairman, Mr. Noel Daly, later resigned his post as chairman of the west north-west hospital group.<br\/>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy James Reilly, told the House on 28 May that a review by the HSE found the procurement of services from the D &amp;amp; F Health Partnership consultancy was not in accordance with internal regulations.<br\/>The question is what has happened in respect of the Northgate contract.  Several questions need to be answered.  What was the value of the contract for information technology services awarded to Northgate?  In light of whatever the value was, did the tendering processes follow correct procedure?  I understand there was an earlier contract with Northgate which was then extended.  Were tendering processes followed correctly at all times?<br\/>Were the Department of Health and the then Minister aware of the possible tendering anomalies to which I am referring in the context of Northgate when the other issue about the maternity services was raised in the Seanad?  If so, why was no advertence made to potential anomalies with the Northgate contract when the Minister dealt with the previous issue in this House?  This is important, particularly considering the Minister gave an assurance that there would be no further breaches in respect of procurement matters.  If the Minister knew at the time that there had already been a significant breach, his not adverting to that fact raises a serious issue.  If any such breach happened subsequently, what does that say about the attitude of this particular hospital group to the question of appropriate tendering and procurement requirements?  Any conflict of interest or commercial connection in respect of any member of senior management of those hospitals raises serious issues.<br\/>It is being reported that the current chief executive of Saolta, Mr. Bill Maher, is the party who has or had some commercial arrangement through consultancy with Northgate.  He is due to finish his term as chief executive of the west north-west hospital group at the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000053#DDD02200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1418236800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Please refrain from naming people on the record of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000053#DDD02300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1418236800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I understand.

My colleague, Senator Averil Power, and I have met members of Educate Together in my area, in which there are Educate Together schools in Balbriggan, Skerries, Swords, Malahide, Holywell, Thornleigh, Rush and Lusk.  It is good that parents have a choice in how they want their children to be taught.  However, there is a major issue, one which relates to all patron bodies, namely, the initial costs of establishment of schools.  To give an example, in Britain Educate Together opened a primary school in Bristol, for which a total of &pound;230,000 sterling was paid to the Educate Together Academy Trust.  One can strip away some of the things for which we would pay, but it is still over &pound;100,000 sterling more than a school here would receive.  If Educate Together establishes a school in temporary accommodation here, as it has done in Malahide, it will receive a one-off payment of &euro;10,000 and that is it.  That is not sustainable.  <\/p><p>In September this year there were 74 primary schools in the Educate Together sector which believes, based on its research, that we will need 300 such schools.  It is not scaremongering in stating this or stating we will need to close down any school or anything like it.  What it is stating is that this issue is inhibiting its ability to set up schools, particularly secondary schools.  To be very fair to it, it is not being selfish about this and it has mentioned that this is an issue that affects all patron bodies.  This issue needs to be addressed specifically for Educate Together, for which I have a lot of regard.  I am glad to say my own party was very involved in providing for parental choice when my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was the then Minister for Education and Science.  We need to do something about the provision of funding for the establishment of schools, given that there are ongoing issues in this regard.

I am in the House on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who was unable to attend.  <\/p><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to outline to the House the funding arrangements for the Educate Together organisation, an issue which is well recognised.  I visited one of its excellent schools in the Senator's area recently and know that the organisation is doing great work.  Naturally, all of us involved in education would like to see greater resources and, as the position improves, it is our aim to try to match resources with demand as best we can.<\/p><p>I inform the Senator that the Minister met a delegation from Educate Together yesterday and funding for the management body was a priority on its agenda.  Despite continuing financial challenges, the Government has remained committed to protecting front-line education services as far as possible.  This priority commitment was most recently demonstrated in budget 2015 when the Minister's priority was to provide funding to maintain class sizes and ensure the education system could recruit more teachers.  As a result, almost 1,400 additional teachers will be taken on in primary and post-primary schools next year.  The budget also provides for an increase of 365 in the existing cap on the numbers of special needs assistant posts.  Funding provision has been made to provide the additional school places needed to meet the increased demand and progress the reform agenda in education.  Our main priority for additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system.<\/p><p>As a matter of policy, the Department does not fund patrons or patron bodies.  It does, however, provide annual grants for the recognised management bodies at primary and post-primary level to assist them in providing management support for the schools in their sectors.  Management bodies such as the CPSMA, Educate Together, the Church of Ireland Board of Education at primary level or second level, the JMB-AMCSS, the IVEA and the ACCS provide important support services for schools in employment, legal, financial and other matters.  The individual management bodies' remit reflects the particular patronage of the schools which they serve.<\/p><p>In 2013 the core funding for the management bodies at primary level amounted to some &euro;760,000, of which the Educate Together management body received &euro;133,000.  This level of funding has regard to the number of schools served by Educate Together and the level of funding provided for other management bodies at primary level.  Educate Together is the national body for 69 primary schools, although the Senator referred to a figure of 75, which perhaps refers to schools it intends to take over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000054#EEE00900","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1418237400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Some are at second level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000054#EEE01000","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1418237400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Some 57 are schools for which Educate Together is the patron, with the remaining 12 being affiliated to it.

At post-primary level, Educate Together is or will be involved in a total of eight schools between now and 2016.  For five of these schools, it is sole patron; it is a co-patron for two of them and in a partnership model in one of them.<\/p><p>In addition to core funding, Educate Together received &euro;80,000 in 2013 and a further &euro;64,000 for opening and taking over patronage of divested schools.

When will the Government ensure that all primary schools are connected to high-speed broadband?  When will the Government ensure that all schools, both primary and post-primary, have access to the equipment they need, curriculum relevant content and training for teachers?<br\/>I welcome the fact that high-speed broadband has been rolled out to our second level schools which are now getting speeds of up to 100 MB, which is the speed they need to integrate ICT properly in the classroom, use video content and upload and download things from the cloud.  Unfortunately, we have a huge digital divide between primary and second level.  While second level schools have high-speed broadband, the Department's own figures for primary schools show that they have an average speed of up to 5 MB per second, which is incredibly slow.  Some schools have considerably slower speeds than that.<br\/>There was an article in this month's INTO magazine <i>In Touch<\/i>, in which a principal was quoted as saying he has 0.74 MB and that the connection was faster when he had dial-up.  Such slow speeds create huge problems for teachers.  It means that when they are putting together videos and planning presentations to their classes, they are not sure if they will be able to show those properly.  <i>In Touch<\/i>cites scenarios where teachers get classes to sit down to watch a three or four minute video clip, but while the first minute plays, they are then sitting around watching a timer on screen trying to load the rest of it.  They could be watching that for three or four minutes before the video kicks back in.  Teachers are also concerned about having to bring things in on USB sticks as they are not sure they will be able to get access to broadband when they need it.  It could be down.  It is all extremely frustrating.  Principals have also said they are supposed to make online returns to the Department and some are having to do that at home.  They are having to make their OLSC entries at home to ensure that their staff are paid on time.  There is a major difficulty there in terms of broadband speed for primary schools.<br\/>I understand that work is under way in the Department on a new digital strategy for schools.  The reason I tabled this matter was to draw the Department's attention to the huge deficit at primary level and to ensure it is addressed as part of the new strategy.  I hope the Minister of State can provide me with an update on the Department's thinking in that regard, the speeds it is expected will be provided to primary schools and when they can expect to have proper connectivity.  There is also a need to ensure that schools have access to curriculum appropriate content.  While there is a great deal available on the Internet, much of it is American or from other countries.  We need to provide teachers with access to age-appropriate screen content which is tied into our own curriculum.  That is a huge issue.<br\/>Equipment is also an issue.  Some schools have fantastic suites of equipment, perhaps on foot of partnerships with local businesses and IT companies or sponsorship or through fund-raising from parents in the absence of sufficient State funding.  There are significant gaps among schools in terms of the type of equipment they have and the gaps need to be closed.  Training is also required to ensure that all teachers receive adequate training, not just those who might opt in to in-service or out-of-hours training.  The people who are most likely to do that are probably already ICT savvy or at least interested in using it.  We must ensure that all existing teachers in the system are brought up to speed and know how to integrate ICT into teaching, learning, assessment and all the other strands of our education system.  We must also ensure that at the pre-service level we equip new teachers with the highest level of ICT competency.<br\/>There are various issues involved.  Many teachers across primary and second level have embraced ICT far beyond the limits of the State under-investment and there is a need to step up.  I was in a second level school in Kildare the other day where the principal raised with me the issue that because of the suppression of A posts within schools, the only way he could get an ICT co-ordinator was to expect someone to do it out of the goodness of his or her heart.  If we want people to co-ordinate ICT within schools, we must consider having specific ICT posts.  I ask the Minister of State to update me on that wide range of issues, the status of the digital schools strategy and whether it will address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000055#FFF00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1418238000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I convey the apologies of my senior Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who could not make it here.  We appreciate that quality Internet connectivity is essential for good teaching and learning using ICT.  While great progress has been made at post-primary level where every school will shortly have a high-speed connection, I am aware that improvement at primary level is slower and is dependent on market and technological developments.  As the Senator points out, it can be very frustrating when a teacher is trying to teach a class and keep the pupils with him or her.  Young people now expect the service to be top notch.  I even see in my own house that when Sky goes, a child of three years of age will ask where the Sky man is.  Likewise when it comes to broadband, young people expect a high level of service, which they deserve.  Certainly, it is something we must aim at, not just in educational facilities but across the board.<br\/>Broadband is a very important issue in all our communities.  Be it a rural or urban area, the availability of broadband is key.  The first thing a teenager asks when one wants to bring him or her somewhere is about the speed of the connection there.  That is where it is at and as a country, we must recognise it.  We must have more conversations on the issue to provide for the years ahead.  Many of the science and research facilities I deal with tell me that we are only at perhaps a tenth of where we will be in terms of information moving through the system.  Apart from dealing with today's situation and looking ahead for a couple of years, we must think of the capacity we will need in the long term.  This area is going to increase a great deal.<br\/>Under the schools broadband access programme, my Department provides for the supply of Internet connectivity for all recognised primary schools.  A new framework involving more providers was put in place in 2012 which ensures improved solutions are available to schools on an ongoing basis.  The professional development service for teachers leads the provision of continuing professional development, CPD, advice and information for teachers on the use of ICT in teaching and learning.  The service is also involved in the annual delivery of approximately 12,000 ICT CPD places for teachers on Department-funded courses.  <i>Scoilnet.ie<\/i>is the national education portal and is actively used by primary and post-primary teachers.  In 2013, 1.66 million visits to the portal were recorded.  This supports what Senator Power said and shows that teachers are genuinely interested and want to get up to speed.  We have to facilitate them as best we can.  I am amazed at the number of events I attend at weekends where teachers turn up in their free time with a willingness to get more involved in advances across ICT, maths, science and engineering.  They are very interested in the core STEM subjects and must be commended for putting that effort in.  We have to match that effort with resources and try to make the commitment to them.<br\/>This is all evidence of teacher interest in quality and up-to-date digital content that is relevant to the school curriculum.  A great deal of good work is being done in the education centres to keep teachers on top of this.  It will be very hard to stay ahead of some of the students when it comes to ICT developments.  The Department's website has evolved to include the provision of free access to a wide variety of education content including, for example, Ordnance Survey Ireland mapping resources and the internationally recognised Encyclopaedia Britannica.  The site further provides for the sharing of teacher-produced resources.  Students have access to these resources also.  Other support services and the national network of education centres also provide support for the use of ICT in teaching and learning in particular areas of interest and need.<br\/>The forthcoming digital strategy for schools, about which the Senator asked in her opening statement, will outline the future direction of policy in this area and address how ICT will support teaching, learning and assessment in our schools into the future.<\/p> <p>Having the right infrastructure in terms of equipment, Internet connectivity, teacher training and availability of access to relevant digital content will be key to achieving effective use of digital technology in the classroom.  Improved connectivity for primary schools will be a priority.  In this regard, my Department will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with a view to providing enhanced broadband services as quickly as possible.  <\/p><p>As part of the implementation of the new strategy there will be an annual plan with clear objectives and a funding commitment in line with the national budgetary strategy.  The strategy will build on the strong desire of teachers to meet the learning needs of primary students.  <\/p><p>We have to be ambitious concerning the digital strategy.  It is certainly something that I will be pushing with the Department, as will the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  We know all about the tight budgetary constraints and it will take us time to achieve what other countries have.  Our strategy needs to set out where we have to go and where we should be.  We should not be limited by current budgets; we should plan the strategy for what the ideal is and try to plan for it.  There will be budgetary constraints and timing might not be as quick as we want, but we have to find new ways of doing that.<\/p><p>There is a greater role for industry to get involved in the business strategy for schools and I am engaging with industry to that end.  Some schools are lucky enough to be located beside the right companies and will benefit greatly from that.  We must find a way that will spread that effect right across the country, however, so that every school - no matter the address - has access to the same kind of material, services and talent to drive this agenda.  <\/p><p>The business agenda and the accompanying strategy is a major part of education, so we have to get it right.

It is bizarre that an e-book costs more than the paper book, even though the latter has to be printed, distributed and sold in shops, while an e-book can be purchased online.  I have raised this point previously with the Minister at the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, but the general response is that European law covers it and we did not get an exemption for e-books.  Obviously, e-books had not been conceived when the EU legislation was enacted, but it does not appear the Government is doing anything to change that.  If we are unhappy with the EU legislation we should be pushing for an updated directive.  I ask the Minister of State to raise that matter with the Minister.  It is a big issue because it is prohibitively expensive for students to use tablets with e-books, rather than carrying around heavy schoolbags.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000056#GGG00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1418238600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Power and it is something we have to make progress on.

We know what the cause is so we have to work on it.  Hopefully we will see some changes in that regard.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for raising these issues and will discuss them with the Minister because they are very important.  My own responsibilities cover enterprise as well as education, but we have to get this strategy right.  We must push these subjects, including technology, engineering and mathematics.  The online supports for all those courses are essential also, so access to broadband and online services both for teachers and pupils is essential.<\/p><p>Our business strategy focuses on the use of such information.  It is so easy to gather data now, but we must teach pupils how to use it individually and through team work.  We have to increase access to equipment but we must also teach students how to handle such knowledge.  <\/p><p>Students must have respect for each other when using IT facilities, including Facebook and other social media.  That is the biggest issue in all the schools I have visited and I am sure it is the same for Senators.  Pupils say that their biggest concern is what goes on via social media.

I have previously raised this ongoing issue both locally and nationally in the Seanad but to no avail.  I cannot overemphasise how precarious the current situation is both for residents and motorists in the area.  If the situation continues unchanged, it will only be a matter of time before more serious accidents occur.<\/p><p>In the past, there have been fatalities in this particular area.  There are nine housing estates in the Ballydavid area with approximately 1,000 residents in total, including children.  Incredibly, despite it being one of the larger populated areas in Athenry, residents from Ballydavid have no continuous footpath into the town centre.  This begs serious questions about the original developments, as well as the planning for these estates and developers' contributions.  Those contributions should be spent for the betterment of such areas. <\/p><p>The problem is compounded by the fact that residents are forced to use two roads, one of which is highly dangerous.  There is also a wide railway bridge with a notorious bend, while the other one is a back road with another railway bridge.  It is incredibly dangerous for road users.  By any standards, they are less than ideal for pedestrians.  The fact that so many people have no option but to use them daily to get to schools, churches or the middle of town, raises more serious road safety issues.<\/p><p>A comprehensive road safety plan is urgently needed for the residents of Ballydavid.  Such infrastructure requires investment which is vital for the Athenry community.  Residents should be able to walk safely to and from the centre of Athenry without risking their lives, all for the want of something as basic as a footpath.  <\/p><p>I hate having to raise such issues in the Seanad but I am frustrated.  I have contacted Galway County Council and have met with council officials on this matter.  I have also raised it in the Seanad, yet the situation has remained unchanged for the last two years.  I therefore implore the Minister to make funds available to rectify this situation and put something as basic as a footpath in the area so that pedestrians can walk safely to and from the town.  Motorists would then not have to swerve to avoid pedestrians in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000056#GGG00600","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1418238600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins for raising this matter.  I am pleased to take this debate in the Seanad this evening and to take the opportunity again to respond to the Senator's request.  I wish to re-emphasise the position regarding the funding of regional and local roads.<\/p><p>I understand the Senator's motion refers to a non-continuous footpath and, separately, to a railway bridge, both of which are located in the vicinity of Ballydavid, Athenry, Co. Galway.  I will begin first of all by addressing the issue of regional and local road funding.<\/p><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, including footpaths, is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.<\/p><p>The role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works, including footpaths, to be funded is also a matter for the local authority and its elected members.<\/p><p>On 23 January this year, my Department announced the &euro;331.9 million investment programme for regional and local roads.  From this, Galway County Council was allocated &euro;18.3 million.  These grants are mainly focused on the maintenance of the existing road network and it is open to Galway County Council to undertake work on footpaths from its discretionary grant allocation.  Short lengths of safety-critical footpaths can also be submitted for consideration under the low-cost safety programme.<\/p><p>All available funding for 2014 has now been allocated and no further funding is available.  I expect to announce the details of the 2015 road grants in January next year.<\/p><p>As regards the Irish Rail bridge at Ballydavid, Athenry, this is an operational matter for Irish Rail.  Irish Rail has provided the following update to my officials regarding the bridge which is designated as OBG156 and spans the Dublin - Galway railway line at Ballydavid.<\/p><p>larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann renewed this bridge in 2013 with a provision for the later addition of a pedestrian deck.  Currently, the pedestrian deck is in storage awaiting the installation of the approach footpaths by Galway County Council.  As soon as the footpaths are nearing completion, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will place the pedestrian deck on the integrated supports on OBG156.  The pedestrian deck was not included in the installation work in 2013, as it was felt that it presented a potential hazard to children inclined to attempt to cross the track using what would have been an unfinished pedestrian way.<\/p> <p>As outlined above, the prioritisation of work on regional and local roads, including the approaching footpaths at this location, is a matter for Galway County Council.<\/p><p>This is communicating to me, as the Senator may already be aware, that the pedestrian deck, which might make a contribution to dealing with some of the difficulty the Senator has outlined, has been constructed and is in storage at the moment.  The challenge in this matter is how funding can be found and how existing funding can be prioritised to allow construction of footpaths at this location to allow the delivery of the pedestrian span in a continuous manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000056#GGG00700","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418239200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I accept that roads fall within the remit of Galway County Council or county councils in general, but where there are road safety issues and there have been fatalities on the road in question and in the area in question, it is not acceptable that the situation continues.  I will contact the director of roads for Galway County Council to ask that he apply for funding when the new funding comes on stream for 2015 and I urge the Minister to seriously prioritise funding for this area to try to rectify the issue.<\/p><p>I am flummoxed and flabbergasted by the remark in the response that the pedestrian deck and the attempts to install it would be a potential hazard to children.  It is a hazard to children on a daily basis as things stand as they make their way to school with no footpath.  Parents are having to dodge cars and motorists are having to dodge pedestrians.  There have been fatalities at this point in the past.  How many more do we need before something is done?  I ask that Deputy Donohoe, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, along with representatives from Irish Rail and Galway County Council, come together and liaise to try to sort out this matter for the 1,000 people living in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000057#HHH00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1418239200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her response.  My challenge in dealing with issues like this is that as Minister my role, as the Senator well knows, is to determine the funding that is available and allocate that to local authorities.  With the knowledge they have of their localities, which is not available to me, they would spend that money in the best way possible for their areas and be able to respond to local needs and decide which projects should go ahead and which should not in a way that I cannot.<\/p><p>However, I was struck, when I received the Senator's motion after it was selected and we were preparing to respond to it, by the fact that money has already been spent to construct a pedestrian span that is now lying in storage and this money was spent by a semi-State body for which I have direct responsibility.  It is a striking situation that taxpayers' money has already been spent on a deck to make that part of it safe and that cannot be installed because the funding is not available to cover off either side of it.  That sounds like a very unusual and specific difficulty.<\/p><p>While as Minister I must respect how Galway County Council spends its funding, given that a deck has been built by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which also has very scarce resources, I will contact the county council and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and its chief executive, to see if anything can be done to move this forward.  When I get into the allocation of funding, I will always allocate the total funding in the expectation that the Senator and the other local representatives will have the best idea of how it can be spent.  It is an unusual position to be in the Seanad and to find out that work has been done on part of a bridge that has been in storage since 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121000057#HHH00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418239200,"counter":476,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 December 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
