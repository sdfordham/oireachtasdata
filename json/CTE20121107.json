We hope that we will be able to answer any questions that arise and give members an insight into the perspective of parents of children with special needs in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Special Needs Parents Association is a peer support network for parents of children with special needs.  We do not define our membership by the age or diagnosis of the children and are very much cross-disability in that respect.  We cover the areas of health, education, welfare and peer to peer support.  Our objective today is to provide members with a parental insight into the factors that both inhibit and support the successful inclusion of children with special educational needs in Ireland.  The submission before members is based on our perspectives on both policy and practice on the ground.  While we have focused on eight areas in particular, they are not exclusive of each other.  Indeed, some of the issues are very closely interrelated.  <\/p><p>  I will go through the main eight points briefly.  One of the areas that we focused on in our submission is the resource model.  The current special educational resource model is based on the actual diagnosis of children.  Therefore, all allocations are categorised on that basis, with particular reference to resource support hours, which is an educational support given by teachers in a school.  The allocation of hours is solely based on the diagnosis of the child.  We would like to propose that the resource allocations in education follow a more needs-based model which is currently being adopted in the area of disability service provision under the progressing disability services national plan.<\/p><p>  On the issue of the assessment of needs, we feel that there needs to be greater co-operation and integration at local level between the HSE assessment of needs officers and the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, particularly for preschool children.  We also feel that the allocation of services for special educational needs and special health needs should follow a singular pathway of assessment.  We would like to see one broad-ranging assessment done for all children, resulting in welfare entitlements, service support entitlements and educational supports being assessed together.  Currently, children undergo several assessments, which places a burden on parents in terms of getting reports and filling out applications for various different supports across health, welfare and education.<\/p><p>  The Special Needs Parents Association strongly recommends the introduction of a classroom assistant to bridge the gap between teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, in terms of their respective roles.  We are of the view that a classroom assistant is the missing piece of the jigsaw with regard to the provision of an integrated educational service, particularly in those mainstream schools where the demands on teachers are higher and where there are a large proportion of pupils with special needs.  The so-called \"withdrawal\" teaching method, which refers to children being taken out of class to have their resource hours provided, does not allow for totally inclusive education.  We would like to see a move towards resource hours being provided within the mainstream class, thereby benefiting the teacher in the classroom, who would have direct support from the resource teacher and would be able to learn from the resource teacher's particular experience and speciality.<\/p><p>  Our association believes that there must be a greater focus on managing the transition phases from early intervention into preschool, from preschool into primary school, from primary onto post primary school and from post primary onto third level education.  One way of improving transitions would be to create better linkages between the different schools in the form of local school partnerships.  <\/p><p>  Shared access to SNAs is a contentious issue for some parents.  As an association, we are concerned that there might be an impression among our public representatives that shared access to SNAs is working on the ground because the parental experience is otherwise.  Shared access does not work in many classroom settings and individual schools and has given rise to unacceptable risks for children.  Health and safety issues have arisen on many occasions due to shared access to SNAs.  This has also led to a reduction in inclusive opportunities in other areas, such as physical education and sport, for children with special needs.  <\/p><p>  Full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has not been carried out on the grounds of the costs involved; this has been well documented.  However, we believe that two aspects of the Act which are imperative could be implemented without the need for significant additional expenditure.  One measure is the mandatory application of individual education plans, known as IEPs.  This is currently international best practice.  We would like to see a linking of the allocation of educational resources to IEPs so that outcomes could be measurable.  Currently we have no system for measuring inputs in special education.  The second measure we would like to see implemented is the establishment of an independent appeals process which is separate from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  We would also like to see an extension of the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to include the operations of the NCSE.  We understand that this is currently being considered by Government.<\/p><p>  Parents of children with special needs are not oblivious to the current economic climate within which the Government is operating.  However, it is important that Deputies and Senators recognise that parents of children with special needs must interface with several Departments and State bodies, such as the HSE and the NCSE, and can feel under duress when their child's needs are not being met due to a lack of resources.  Both the State and parents have a vested interest in maximising future outcomes for children with special needs because one day they will be adults.  As parents, we want them to become adults who can contribute to the State rather than be dependent on it, where possible.  Short-sighted budgetary decisions to meet the current demands of external parties can have a detrimental effect on children's future outcomes and place additional financial burdens on the State in the longer term.  Maximising investment in children with disabilities serves not only to benefit the children themselves but also the future prospects of their families.  We would like to be net contributors to the State.  Parental perspectives can be greatly influenced by the overall package of supports that they and their children receive in order to maximise the child's potential and alleviate the additional stresses and difficulties that can be experienced by families.  It is often indicated by parents that their child's disability is far easier to cope with than the system itself.  The system does not work for us and any measures that would make it work for us, rather than for itself, must be pursued in earnest by this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352294700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Dempsey.

It has undergone a radical change.  There are now more than 9,000 SNAs in the country; that figure has come from a low base several years ago.  Undoubtedly, issues remain, and I thank the Special Needs Parents Association for taking the opportunity to highlight them to us.<\/p><p>  Are children who have a need for a SNA being assessed and having their needs met in terms of the delivery of SNA hours?  What is the recent experience of the association in this regard?  Has it observed a squeezing in respect of the allocation of special needs assistants to children who would rightly be regarded as requiring these services in recent years?  In my engagements with the National Council for Special Education it has maintained that the numbers meet the need, but the response of those affected is different.  What exactly is the association's experience from engaging with parents?  Has it noticed a change in recent times?

When we met representatives of the NCSE recently, its representatives were adamant that there were more than enough resources in place to meet demand.  However, when we speak to parents and groups they maintain that has not been their experience.  There are differing opinions about whether enough resources have been allocated or whether the issue relates to the criteria used.  Will the association expand on this and especially on the criteria for diagnosis as opposed to arising need?<\/p><p>  The other issue referred to by the association in its submission was the school transport scheme and the difficulties facing parents with special needs children.  They provided some examples, but are there any numbers to support this and show how it is affecting people?  I was rather surprised when I read the submission, especially the reference to the circular.  It is astonishing that the criteria used to determine eligibility for the school transport scheme do not take into account special educational needs, and this is having a significant impact.  If one does not take into account these particular circumstances then one is limiting the options available to families and parents.  Will the association elaborate on this point?<\/p><p>  Will the representatives expand on the transition from primary to post-primary education?  Having spoken to parents I feel this is a particular area where there is considerable scope for improvement, especially when we know certain students will be graduating to post-primary.  It is almost like starting again when a student graduates to post-primary and there appears to be no consideration of this in terms of preparing a student in fifth or sixth class for the transition to post-primary school.  I would appreciate if the association gave us some of its experiences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700004#F00400","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1352294700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will not repeat the questions that were raised already.  I read the documents sent in by the association.  Many of the suggestions make practical sense, including the idea of pulling the various Departments together, especially those responsible for welfare service supports and education, to determine how we drive the issues, rather than dealing with different groups all the time.  This issue has been raised with me often by parents who are highly stressed from trying to deal with the various documents, applications and so on.  A proposal is needed.  What response has the association received from the Departments?  Has it been positive?  Have the Departments worked with the association?  All Deputies should push this issue.<\/p><p>  The NCSE used the word \"quantum\" to describe the level of support, suggesting a fixed amount.  The association would prefer to use the word \"continuum\".  Will they develop this point?

The best thing about the Special Needs Parents Association is that in political discussions it always comes to the table with proposals and common sense and this makes our work a good deal easier.  I am keen to hear its views on several issues.  The representatives spoke about SNAs and the need for classroom assistants.  Is the association satisfied with the criteria in place for SNAs?  I am always astonished when one shows parents the criteria and job description for a SNA.  They are informed that the SNA's responsibilities include cleaning up the classroom and doing photocopying for the teacher.  This takes many parents and children with special needs by surprise because they presume the special needs assistant is there to look after the child.<\/p><p>  There is a recurring debacle every couple of years with regard to school leavers with intellectual disabilities and their transition from school to a placement, whether in a day care centre or in further training or education.  What are the views of the association on what can be done to improve that system?<\/p><p>  A policy review for the domiciliary care allowance is currently talking place, which is welcome.  Did the association make a submission?  If so, can the representatives give us an idea of what was in it?  At the moment a child must sign off the domiciliary care allowance at the age of 16 years and apply for disability allowance.  While the disability allowance is a higher payment financially, there are significant difficulties in terms of children with special needs having to sign a form declaring that they are disabled.  Does the association have a view on that?<\/p><p>  In the document submitted, the association referred to a degree of improvement in that the NCSE is beginning to seek the views of parents.  This appears to be a radical step forward.  Will the association outline its relationship with the NCSE and how the council is interacting with parents?<\/p><p>  We know there are many good SENOs throughout the country.  However, as public representatives we notice a geographical difference.

There has been a cap of 10,575 SNAs for the past two years.  When this cap was first implemented, the NCSE kept back approximately 475 whole-time SNA posts with a view to allocating them later in the year for emergency applications, new applications, assessments and late applications.  During the first year, the NCSE, the schools and everyone else had to adapt to a restricted initial application of SNAs.  This year there was a recognition that the retention of so many posts was an over-cautious policy.  Up to last June, more than 200 whole-time SNA posts had not been allocated.  This year the NCSE allocated those posts from the outset so that they were in place in September.  We have received fewer complaints from parents about specific SNA allocations this year.  Complaints seem to concentrate on the shared access.  Some parents still have difficulties with the reductions in their individual schools.  While the Government has not imposed a cut on SNA numbers over the past two years, when SNA hours are reduced at a local level, parents view this as a cut.  Whether it is a policy decision or not, a cut is a cut as far as parents are concerned.  The rebuttal position is that the SNA cap is in place and there are an adequate number of SNAs to meet the demand.<\/p><p>  Perspectives vary on SNA support in schools.  In the main, parents and children are managing with their level of SNA support.  However, the shared access policy for managing support seems to have been pushed forward.  This has raised a number of health and safety issues.  Special needs assistants have raised the issue of shared access at their annual delegate conference.  They have explained it is difficult to run around between two or three different classes in order to look after five children on different floors of a school.  It is not working from a logistical point of view in some areas.<\/p><p>  The allocation of SNAs depends on the perspective of those who organise the SNAs.  The special needs assistance organisers, SENO, are the gatekeepers for the allocations to schools.  For example, there are discrepancies in decisions.  It can be the case that a full-time SNA could be allocated to a school to care for one child while another child might have shared access with another two children.  Parents ask why a child in Limerick has an full-time SNA attending to his or her needs while another child is struggling.  They ask why a parent is called in to the school to help look after the care needs of his or her child because the SNA cannot cover the care needs of the three or four children who need help.  We do not want the SNA cap to be breached or lowered until the system is allowed to settle down.  The new system of allocations has only been in operation for the past 12 months.<\/p><p>  The core criteria for the SNA is an issue in particular for children with autism and developmental disabilities.  Care needs are the criteria for the allocation of an SNA.  These tend to be the physical, hands-on care needs of a child.  Some children, by the nature of their disability, cannot access the curriculum and therefore their educational needs are barred by their disability.  Their disability does not qualify them for an SNA because they may not have specific care needs such as toileting or assistance with feeding and they may not be a severe flight risk.  However, they need someone to guide them in the class while the class teacher is addressing 30 or more pupils.  The teacher-pupil ratio has increased over recent  years as has the demands on teachers' time.  Some parents believe that their children are languishing in the classroom.  <\/p><p>  We have proposed the use of classroom assistants.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned classroom assistants when he addressed the SNA annual delegate conference.  We do not propose them as a resource on top of the current 10,500 SNAs.  Many SNAs have, at their own cost, trained themselves to higher levels - to level No. 9.  They have developed higher skills than some of the SNAs who possess only the basic levels of educational qualifications.  Currently SNAs are not required to have completed the SNA course to become an SNA.  Some SNAs may not have even a basic level of skills as there is no mandatory requirement that an SNA should have a first aid certificate or a manual handling certificate.  It is up to the school whether it wants to provide funding for an SNA to attend these courses.<\/p><p>  We would not regard classroom assistants as being quasi-educationalists.  I acknowledge that the teaching unions would not be in favour of having unqualified persons acting in a teaching capacity.  However, the role of the assistant would be to facilitate the teacher in addressing the needs which are not strictly care needs.  This would free up SNAs - those with lower levels of qualifications - to allow them address the physical care needs of children.  There might be an overall reduction in the number of people who have the job title of SNA but some of those people could, with further training, graduate to the role of classroom assistant.  This would have a more general job description and role in terms of facilitating and helping the whole class.  Much of the SNA job description includes tidying up the classroom and looking after small groups of children.  Many of the duties of SNAs have nothing to do with the care needs of the child.  In some respects, parents are concerned that SNAs are being used as a whole-school resource while the needs of their children are not being addressed.  If a child's needs are being addressed, a parent will not have an issue with what the SNA does outside that time.  There are cases where the SNA may be photocopying in the office while the child needs to go to the toilet or needs assistance with getting books out of a school bag.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700005#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352295900,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will address the issue of transport, but before doing so I wish to add to what Ms Dempsey said.  In recent years there has been a move away from individualised supports towards a whole-school resource approach.  We would challenge this and certainly would not accept it.  We are concerned that legislators might assume that the whole-school resource approach is working fine, but that is not the case.  We do not concede the point on individualised supports, particularly as there are some children who will always require such supports.  On a practical level, parents have informed us of the inconsistency in how schools apply various policies on the allocation of SNAs or resource hours.  In addition, school principals take different approaches to how they manage resources.  Again, there is no consistency in this regard.<\/p><p>  We made a point on the links and interconnectivity between many of these issues.  In that context, I return to the matter of the training provided for educators in respect of special needs education.  We must ask whether these individuals are receiving the best training and support in how they manage resources.  Deputies Simon Harris, Charlie McConalogue and Jonathan O'Brien referred to our experience of the management of resources.  Perhaps this is more than just an issue of the number of SNAs.  It may also be about the professionalism of educators within the school community and the training with which they are provided in order to allow them to manage the resources and meet demand in a much more confident and productive manner.  I do not wish to be overly critical in this regard.  However, this point must be taken into account.<\/p><p>  The issue relating to classroom assistants goes to the heart of integration.  The withdrawal method - the most popular of the methods in use - does not work, particularly in crowded classrooms in mainstream secondary schools.  I am not referring to special schools.  What happens in the mainstream sphere is that a resource teacher will take a number of children out of class in order to give them more focused assistance with their learning.  We are concerned about the level of in-class support for these children when they return to the classroom.  We have been discussing this matter with the National Council for Special Education and the special education section of the Department of Education and Skills and they have acknowledged our concerns.  We recognise that they are coming towards the idea of trying various techniques, including team teaching whereby resource teachers are brought into the classroom to work with the main teacher.  This is a welcome development and we would like to see further movement in this direction.  Another technique in this regard is to bring in classroom assistants and allow them to reinforce the learning resource teachers are imparting to children.  Both of these are definitely options which should be considered.  We recognise that the Department is aware of them and moving towards examining the position on them.  It may introduce pilot projects at a number of locations.  This is a move we would welcome.<\/p><p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has referred to what appears to be a very interesting situation where the school transport system works very well in certain circumstances but that there is a limit when it comes to recognising what is required by those with special needs.  The argument in this regard is that the service provide is resource driven and does not meet the requirements of those with special needs.  We met representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and put these issues to them.  The first point to make on the school transport system is that there is another principle involved, that of parental choice.  The difficulty with the existing system is that it flies in the face of reality.  In that context, one's local school may not be the best resourced or most appropriate school to which to send one's child.  That point is not conceded in any of the documentation or circulars on the school transport system.  Only one criterion is used in this regard - children must attend their local school.<\/p><p>  Senator Marie Moloney referred to children who had been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and their escorts.  While school transport may be provided, parents face another struggle when it comes to escorts.  We have found that children with this disorder and those with ADHD and ADD have the greatest need for escorts.  There have been cases where SENOs with responsibility for making recommendations to the school transport section of the Department would not accept additional passengers.  Neither would they accept that a report obtained by a parent on his or her child was sufficient to suggest an escort was required.  We are aware of cases where children were taken out of school while issues of this nature were being resolved.  The last thing one wants is an education system which allows, encourages or facilitates the withdrawal of children from school because their health and safety are not being provided for.  The parents of the children to whom I refer will not allow them to avail of school transport if escorts are not provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700006#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1352295900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>There are 15 minutes remaining in this slot.

They were using a teaching assistant model.  That teaching assistant was full-time and assigned to a specific number of teachers.  We should examine, as was said, the care and learning needs of the child.  I used to supervise teacher education and I saw many SNAs in classrooms and the child was looking around or holding their hand.  I do not believe that model is adequate.  If there is a human being in the classroom with a teacher, that person should be upskilled enough to work to provide for all of the needs of the special needs child in the classroom.   We could be blindfolded here in saying the SNA model, as it is framed, is the correct, full and wholesome one to meet all needs.

I agree with the association's recommendation for the introduction of classroom assistants to bridge the gap between teachers and SNAs.  More focus on managing the transition phase between early intervention services is required.  Some of the systems in primary, post-primary and third level education are not up to scratch and in certain cases they are not even in place.<\/p><p>  When we came into government there was a retention of 475 SNA posts, but I am delighted there was a full allocation of SNA posts this year.  That system of retention of posts was a disaster from day one.

Parents are directly involved in the steering group, and work is ongoing.<\/p><p>  It is important to discuss briefly this core assessment.  We are aware there are cross-departmental groups in operation across education, health and welfare, but we would particularly make a call for this group to examine one core pathway not only for disability services and assessments under the assessment of needs but for everything to ensure we do not have to go from pillar to post to get all the resources our children need.  That is a model we would like to be explored by the cross-departmental group, be it the existing one or a new one set up for that purpose.<\/p><p>  There is not a specific budget for the needs of school leavers.  What we have is a random response year on year.  We have budget constraints.  We cannot meet the needs of all the school leavers who in general would have anywhere from mild to severe learning and physical disabilities.  Even by September there were still approximately 100 of the 700 school leavers who had no placement.  These are generally people who have older parents who have their own needs to be met.  It is not acceptable that every year we face this problem from May onwards and that there is not a fixed budget to address the school leavers issue.<\/p><p>  In terms of the relationship with the NCSE, we have had several meetings with it in recent years.  We go to it with questions, it answers our questions, we make proposals and we discuss them.  We appreciate that it encourages our input in that respect.<\/p><p>  Regarding special educational needs officers, their quality will differ depending on the person and their background.  SENOs come from various backgrounds and there are no specific qualifications.  That is an area that must be examined because the evidence is that it may affect decisions across different areas.<\/p><p>  On the equipment issue, we have cited a case from the Ombudsman in regard to a child.  I know that family personally and the ins and outs of that case.  Equipment supplied through the Department in terms of educational support equipment, such as laptops, computers and that type of specialist equipment, is diagnosis-based.  If someone does not meet the criteria in terms of diagnosis, he or she does not get the equipment.  The Ombudsman was clear in her determination that this must be examined.  That brings us back to using a needs-based system rather than a diagnosis-based system.<\/p><p>  There is an issue in rural Ireland because resources are stretched, services and schools are further apart, there are fewer special units and special schools and, therefore, distances travelled by children will be longer.  In some areas there could be a family which has one child with special needs and two other children in national school.  That presents a logistical problem for the parent who is not granted special transport and who may have two children who only have to travel five minutes to their local school and another child who has a 60 km trip to their school.  We are using a specific case in this instance rather than making up figures.  That is something we raised in the meeting with the special education unit and the transport section of the Department.<\/p><p>  On the independent appeals process, we have an independent appeals process for social welfare entitlements.  We have an appeals process in the HSE but we do not have an appeals process for special education.  The reason we have sought an independent appeals board consistently over the past two years is because when the first tranche of SNA reductions, which were severe, came in over two years ago as a result of the value for money review ongoing since 2009.  Principals, who were essentially the gatekeepers for a parent trying to appeal for further assistance for their child, were afraid to draw attention to their remaining resources and therefore did not want to be reviewed.  In some cases, they did not ask the senior SENO to re-examine the case because they did not want them back in their school for fear of losing further resources.  That was the period from 2009 to 2010 when there were major reductions in the number of SNAs.  While there might have been merit in some cases, the schools operated for years on the basis that they had a certain number of support staff and they were taken away in the one move.  There were fears about that.  People have adapted to the current level of SNAs but, as we have identified in our submission, there are instances where shared access is not practical.<\/p><p>  Parents should have the right to appeal a decision, especially regarding shared access for their children, because from school to school it is principals who are now deciding, on the basis of a whole-school resource allocation, who gets what.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700007#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352297100,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dempsey and Mr. Kelly.

I am grateful for the opportunity to present on this issue which is close to our hearts.  Social Justice Ireland has always been of the view that the budget process does not allow for much of the work that requires to be done, in particular in advance of the budget.<\/p><p>  We wish to say four things on pre-budget audits.  The first is that they are welcome.  Second, we want to look at what happens currently without pre-budget audits.  We want to examine what a pre-budget audit would be like.  Finally, we want to look at what it would achieve for budget 2013.  We have five minutes so we will just hit a few points on each issue.<\/p><p>  First, pre-budget audits would be welcome and would bring real reform.  We know the Government is committed to reform of the budgetary process.  We are not convinced that it has gone nearly far enough.  Some of the things that have been done are welcome but the introduction of pre-budget audits would be a most welcome initiative.  It would hopefully result in the elimination of kite flying and the destabilisation that comes with such a practice because all sorts of ideas get flown as kites and have the impact of making people worried even though there might not be much substance to them, whereas, if there was a pre-budget audit such an exercise would be unnecessary.  A pre-budget audit process would also ensure that parliamentarians would be fully informed before they vote on the budget.  Much of the problem currently is that the budget is presented and most Members in either Chamber have had very little time to see it or discuss it in advance and they are voting on particular parts of it within a matter of hours.<\/p><p>  In terms of what happens currently without pre-budget audits, one consequence of budget 2012 is that the income of the poorest 40% of households fell by a factor of 2% to 2.5% while the richest households fell by only 0.7%.  The budget was skewed towards benefitting the better off rather than those who are poorest.  The bottom 40% took the major hit.  A pre-budget audit would have shown that was the situation that would emerge and if it were sufficiently clear in advance I hope it would have produced a different outcome in that the Government would have made adjustments.<\/p><p>  In the absence of pre-budget audits over the past 25 years - let us look at the period between 1986 and 2011 - social welfare rates dramatically fell behind pay and other increases across all sectors, yet because there was a substantial increase in welfare in budgets in the years from 2005 to 2007 and people tend to look only at the most recent years there is a misunderstanding that welfare recipients have benefited enormously compared to others.  However, when one looks at the process over a quarter of a century one sees that is not true.  A pre-budget audit would show that to be the case.<\/p><p>  A third issue arises in that context which we feel is important, namely, without a pre-budget audit the selective use of data leads to inaccurate analysis which in turn leads to inappropriate policy proposals and decisions.  That is not confined to the Oireachtas.  A recent troika document selectively used data in five areas we identified and discussed with them.  They did not challenge anything we presented to them in recent meetings.  We have shown, for example, that they selectively used the data on poverty, how unemployment rates have fallen over time and data on the increase in welfare rates in the past decade, which is the one to which I just referred.  They have selectively chosen data on replacement ratios and they have also selectively used data on the distribution of hits in the budgets during the recession.  Those are just five examples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700008#K00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352297700,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I call the spokesperson for TASC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700009#L00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352297700,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our ideas about the budget and a pre-budget audit.  TASC is an independent, progressive think tank which promotes equality, democracy and sustainability through evidence-based policy analysis and recommendations.  In our recent budget analysis and in previous budgets we discussed the issue of an economic audit and an equality audit as being important components of the budget, and therefore I welcome the proposal for a more comprehensive system of pre-budget auditing and echo many of the comments made earlier by Dr. Healy.<\/p><p>  The reason TASC has a budget proposal is because we are concerned about the issue of economic inequality in this country.  During the boom times Ireland had a persistent level of economic inequality and a gap in society in terms of income and wealth.  With a series of austerity budgets, there is a risk of that gap widening.<\/p><p>  We know that when we go into auditing, it is not just about income or wealth in cash terms.  Many cuts to public services have a disproportionate effect on people on lower incomes or those who are vulnerable and, as a result, we would expect an auditing process to take account of the cash equivalent value of public services.  People suddenly have to pay a fee for a service they did not have to pay previously or they see the reduction in services they now have to pay for out of their own pockets.  That is a doubling of the effect on low income households.  We are very conscious that it is not just about measuring income disparities but about the wider economic inequality which must be measured in terms of the value of services to people.<\/p><p>  In that context we put forward our proposals.  A nine page document was circulated to the committee.  That is based on a large 50 page document which is available on our website, and in turn that is based on wider economic literature and a great deal of work TASC has been doing in recent years.<\/p><p>  Our concern with economic equality is now being echoed across the economics literature.  We have seen reports from the OECD and even the IMF which refer to the importance of equality within economic systems, that equality was a factor leading up to the economic crisis, and the need to factor in issues of equality, income and wealth when seeking to rebuild economies in the current context.<\/p><p>  In terms of our analysis as we lead up to the budget, our focus has been on the need to examine the tax system.  The remit of the committee is education and social protection, but we cannot talk about our welfare system or whether we have a welfare state unless we examine the overall balance of tax and spending.<\/p><p>  In that context, as members will have seen in the proposals circulated, TASC favours a 4:1 ratio in terms of tax versus spending cuts.  I echo what Dr. Healy said in that the troika has made it very clear that there are options in terms of how we choose to go about repairing the deficit.  There is no doubt we must close the deficit, but we have options.<\/p><p>  In our proposals, in terms of the economic audit, we have drawn on the literature on what taxation is least damaging to job growth, and in terms of our equality audit, we have focused on the measures that are more likely to have the effect of reducing income and wealth inequality.  For example, we have looked at taxes such as capital acquisitions tax, or inheritance tax, as it is known, which do the least damage to the economy and to jobs because we are taxing wealth.  Likewise, taxes on higher pay are less likely to damage job growth than taxes on lower pay.<\/p><p>  In particular, in recent years we have been developing our own equality proofed property tax model.  A property tax could be an important form of funding for local government but we argue against waivers because we must have the most robust tax system possible bringing in the maximum income.  A fairer system would be to have deferred payment on an ability to pay basis which would protect not only low income home owners but also those on higher incomes who may have very high mortgage or child care costs and would be permitted to defer payment over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700009#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nat O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352298300,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

As always, the reports we get from Social Justice Ireland and TASC are detailed on where choices can be made.  Do the witnesses not feel that the debt burden we are carrying in this country is unsustainable?  In order to pay back the debt, we will be in a similar situation to the current one year-on-year and it will not be resolved.  That is a key question we must examine.<\/p><p>  At this point, following five years of austerity budgets and with &euro;24 billion being taken out of the economy, we must be more robust in speaking out in particular about areas of vulnerability.  The point has been made that, to a certain degree, we in this country have been protected because of the strong social welfare system and that the true impact of austerity has not been felt.  I fear the budget for this year and the next two years will have such an impact if the Government does not focus on those who have wealth.  We must come out more strongly.  I do not know the position of the witnesses on whether funding must be ring-fenced, in particular for those who are vulnerable.  Prices are not coming down.  The cost of gas has increased, which will have a knock-on effect on the cost of groceries.  It has been a disastrous year for agriculture in this country, in Britain, Europe and parts of America.  We must face the fact that we cannot hit certain sectors anymore.  I agree with what has been said about job creation and where we get the money from.  The United Left Alliance is not drawing up an alternative budget but a statement on where the money can be targeted from the wealth of assets that exist.  We would also promote an increase in tax on earnings of more than &euro;100,000.  We could get anything from &euro;1.8 billion to &euro;3 billion from more progressive taxation on the wealthy.  It will be an important call to ring-fence funding in order to protect the most vulnerable.  Otherwise, they will be impacted by cuts to secondary social welfare elements.<\/p><p>  It is proposed to take out &euro;540 million from the social welfare budget this year.  Where will that come from?  It would be destructive to take anything from welfare payments to people who are at home because they lost their jobs but who want to be in work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700010#M00700","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1352298300,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Butler wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700010#M00800","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1352298300,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Social Justice Ireland and TASC for their presentations.

The witnesses have spoken about a year-round process and budget audit.  One can see the negativity coming from the media.  They would have a field day.  Governments would suffer if this system was introduced.  It would be difficult to introduce a year-round process.  It is bad enough to have a three-month pre-budget period but if that were extended to 12 months, the people would burn down Leinster House.<\/p><p>  I accept what was said by the witnesses about the complexity of the social protection system and that due to the different classes of stamps, people do not know their entitlements.  The system is poorly regulated.  I come from a self-employed background.  Many businesses have closed down and are seeking social protection and help but they do not know what stamp they are paying.  Even working people who pay PRSI do not know what stamp they are paying.  The social protection system in this country must be examined and better information must be provided to everyone.

I do not mean a financial divide but that people are being set against each other.  There is animosity between workers and unemployed people and it is sad to see that develop because some of the people who are unemployed now were working last year or the year before.  In bad times people turn on each other, and that is very sad to see.  Some workers believe unemployed people get everything while they get nothing.  We must discourage that mindset but I do not know how we can do that.  A person should not be better off unemployed than working but do we cut social welfare payments or increase wages?  Increasing wages will be a matter for the employers but in the current economic climate I cannot see them doing that.  I would never advocate cutting social welfare payments.  I would fight tooth and nail to keep the current rates and have done with the Minister but in some cases double payments were given, and that drove working people mad.  If people who are working see someone on a social welfare benefit or on a community employment scheme getting a double payment, which amounted to half a week's work, they were aggravated about that.

This committee had a long session on that issue and we have given suggestions on it, for example, if we bring the self-employed into the system they should be allowed to pay the same rate as a PAYE worker.  That would generate more funds into the system and give them their benefits when times are hard for them or when they are ill.<\/p><p>  Another idea I suggested on which I would like the witnesses' feedback is that in many instances people are signing for credited contributions with no income from it; they are doing it to protect their pension.  A small charge of, say, &euro;1 per week, is a cheap pension policy for somebody signing for credits for pension purposes.  We could speak about carers and so on and spend the day talking about each sector individually but I would like the witnesses' feedback on some of those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700011#N00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1352298900,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I want to add one brief point to my contribution.

On Senator Moloney's point, we must get out the message that everybody in our society is making their contribution.  I understand that in other countries, including the Nordic countries, people on the equivalent of our social welfare make some contribution along the lines of what Senator Moloney stated.  People must give something to get something back, but that should be done across our society in a redistributive way.  In recent years an entire section of people who may have been long-term unemployed would have got social welfare, and there would be resentment about that.  I accept that may be unjustified but the idea of everybody contributing to our recovery should be examined.<\/p><p>  Regarding the pre-budget audit, the Oireachtas has implemented an all-year process.  We are in the first part of that.  We had a substantial number of pre-budget meetings with the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection in which we went through a great deal of information.  On the point about kite flying, there was a great deal of kite flying last year but much of what is in the public domain now is not kite flying.  It is information that has come out from Oireachtas meetings and reports that have been put into the public domain, as well as information gleaned from parliamentary questions asked by TDs.  We must be careful not to label everything as kite flying because the only people who can kite fly are Ministers.  The idea is that they put out the information to gauge public reaction but that is not what a backbench or an Opposition TD does when he or she makes a suggestion.<\/p><p>  I have another concern about what Dr. Healy proposed.  There is a group of people which meets with people who are poor and those who are struggling on a daily basis.  They are TDs.  People come to our clinics.  That is the reason I resent the idea that there is something wrong with what is called clientelism because it is voters contacting their TDs about their concerns and the way decisions affect them in their lives.  There is an issue about representative democracy.  We could not have a process such as the partnership process which tried to replace directly elected representatives.  I flag that concern but that is not to say that I am not favourably disposed to the idea Dr. Healy proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700011#N00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352298900,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank all the members who made interesting points in that context.

We focused on that rather than on our pre-budget submission which members have already but there are connections between the two of them.  For example, on Deputy Collins's point about ring-fencing, we do not believe there should be any reductions in welfare or in child benefit.  We have argued that that should not be the case but we have shown the reason we make that case.  Not only have we shown how the Government can reach its borrowing requirement reduction of &euro;3.5 billion as required by the troika while protecting the vulnerable and those who are poor but we presented fully costed proposals across the system.  Central to that is the change in the ratio between expenditure cuts and increases in taxation.

It is important that we not get carried away with the misinterpretation of many of the data.  Misinterpretation is not confined to Members of either House, for example, but has been evident in troika publications.  The fact is that the income of three out of four individuals receiving an income through the social welfare process would be 40% greater if they were employed.  This is taken from the ESRI's budget prospectus publication for 2013, which was released a matter of weeks ago.  This is the most up-to-date datum.  I referred to replacement ratios.  The troika has written rubbish - uninformed claptrap - about replacement ratios and has circulated it as factual analysis.  It has been very selective with the data it has used and consequently produced inaccurate analysis and an inappropriate policy position.  When we met representatives of the troika, we presented it with a document &ndash; it is publicly available and on our website &ndash; in which we outlined its mistakes.  It did not dispute our contention at the time and has not done so since.  We have offered to meet the troika's technical teams if they believe our analysis of what the troika has done is in any way questionable.<\/p><p>  Let me deal with two points raised by the Chairman, one of which has to do with long-term unemployment and resentment.  In this regard, we are again in serious danger of communicating nonsense.  There has been much commentary at the highest level of public broadcasting indicating that 100,000 people would not take up a job when there were jobs available before the crash.  This is rubbish and not in accordance with the facts.  In 2007, the last year before the recession and crash, the unemployment rate was approximately 4%.  One must examine long-term unemployment, however, because there are many people unemployed who have just come out of school or college, who have just been let go or who are in transition from one job to another.  In 2007, the long-term unemployment rate was 1.3%.  Some 28,000 people were unemployed for more than one year.  Today, this number has risen to 182,000.  Nobody will convince me that the 164,000 who make up the balance are layabouts or useless people who have basically decided they will opt for a lifestyle choice of living on the dole.

I am strongly of the view that nothing should replace the role of Parliament, that is, the role of elected Deputies and Senators, Oireachtas committees and so on, which is the reason, for example, I would like to see that in this context.  This also was the reason that for all the years during which we were in social partnership, I made a proposal, which was written about and published endlessly by our organisation, that we would welcome an opportunity in which an Oireachtas committee, either pre-existing or set up for the purpose, would engage on a quarterly basis with all those involved in social partnership to go through any updates and so on.  We strongly expressed the view all the time that there was not a single item in a national agreement that did not have Government support.  Any proposal that did not have Government support, no matter who was making it, did not wind up in an agreement.  As part of the community and voluntary pillar, we never had the major role in social partnership but we did play an active and strong role there in trying to represent vulnerable and poor people, as well as many other groups who needed support in the process.  However, I always have accepted completely the primacy of the elected Parliament and parliamentarians.  Throughout the 15 or so years in which we were there, we argued repeatedly for a greater engagement by the Oireachtas.  In that context, we constantly suggested an Oireachtas committee in order that both Opposition and Government people would be involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700013#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1352300100,"counter":69,"content":"<p>That is good to know because this issue was raised in here as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700013#P00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352300100,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The Chair's point is taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700013#P00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352300100,"counter":71,"content":"<p>If it is all right with members, I will speak briefly before inviting my colleagues to talk about a couple of technical points.  As for protecting people with low incomes who are vulnerable, perhaps I did not make it clear enough in my presentation but we provide numbers and cost estimates for all our proposals, which indicate one can meet the target the Government has set this year without being obliged to cut social protection for those with low incomes or who are vulnerable.  We absolutely would state one could ring-fence and protect secondary benefits, as well as primary benefits.  On where we would get money for jobs, our proposal of &euro;4.5 billion involves looking at the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which essentially is a national wealth fund.  Again, the economic evidence suggests that now is the time when one will get much more value for money in investing that money in the economy, not simply for a short-term stimulus and job creation but by targeting it in areas of strategic infrastructure, such as broadband, in which one will get a return in long-term economic development for both the private sector and the State, as well as longer-term jobs.  That is where we would look for this money.  Moreover, many other proposals about money, such as the private pension funds and so on, have been articulated.<\/p><p>  In respect of the two-party Government and the programme for Government, we are considering our own strategic plan in conjunction with my board of directors, many of whom have worked in the private sector for all their lives and in some cases were chief executive officers of major corporations.  Their view is that in the private sector, a strategic plan of three years probably is long enough.  The programme for Government is for five years and there is no doubt that if the Government wished to conduct a review halfway through to ascertain how it was getting on, it could review, rewrite and change the programme for Government.  As it is a living document, I would not think it is very much tied to that.  Indeed, the fact of having a two-party Government is a strength in a way, as it can try to build a broader consensus.  If pre-budget audits and analysis are to be carried out, it will require cross-party support for the kind of data that must be presented and for that kind of analysis to be opened up to scrutiny and not politicised.<\/p><p>  On the question of the divide between workers and the unemployed, I echo many of the points made by Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy.  In my previous work in the Homeless Agency, we once carried out a survey of everyone who was homeless at a particular time in which we asked people about their desire to go into work.  Nearly half of those in emergency accommodation were keen to get work and more than half of those who were sleeping rough at the time stated they would like to get work.  While their preparedness for work and how realistic that was are open to question, there is a desire in people to have and to be in work.  This pertains to all the social benefits and personal dignity that go with having a job and having a role in society.  This desire is very strong and I would dispute any claim that there are tens of thousands of people who are unwilling to work.  I believe there is a lot of stereotyping and a lot of very nasty commentary which is not based on evidence or on working with people.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Tom McDonnell, will talk about the debt and the three years of budgets to come, after which my colleague, Ms Aoife N&iacute; Lochlainn, will talk about the issue of how equality auditing would be done in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700013#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nat O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352300100,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Deputy Joan Collins asked about debt and debt sustainability.  As members are aware, Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio was previously forecast to peak at approximately 120% in 2013.  That was contingent upon growth levels that perhaps were slightly unrealistic and optimistic, as indeed they have been for the past four years, because of modelling problems and optimism bias.  However, the point is that if growth is lower than anticipated, as is likely, and as IMF multipliers that measure the impact of austerity and stimulus on growth and employment come to pass in the future, as is likely, then growth and employment will be lower and the debt-to-GDP ratio will not stabilise at 120%.  In itself, however, even a ratio of 120% is a problematic number because if one considers Ireland's debt-to-GNP ratio, it will peak at approximately 150%, and the weight of evidence from economic history suggests that beyond 90%, such debt begins to weigh permanently on growth and employment.  Consequently, in an economy with a higher ratio of debt than that, certainly at ratios of 120% or 150%, the burden becomes increasingly heavy and one wastes more and more of one's income each year on debt interest repayments.  In a couple of years' time, for example, the interest repayments would exceed the entire education budget and both short-term and long-term growth become lower.  The productivity potential of one's economy becomes lower and one moves towards a negative cycle, which becomes increasingly worse and one moves towards a situation akin to that which obtains in Japan.  While one might argue that Japan has maintained its high levels of debt for a long time, the Japanese economy essentially has stagnated for two decades.  Is that what we want for Ireland and is that the way we are going?<\/p><p>  In addition, a country such as Ireland is more susceptible than are countries such as Japan or the United States.  One reason is that we are dollarised, albeit with euro, in that we do not control our currency.  This means we can run out of money and debt sustainability actually kicks in at a much lower point than it would for countries such as Japan, which have maintained a higher level of debt than 150%.  One can see that the other countries in Europe which are engaging in the same process as Ireland, that is, Greece, Portugal and Spain, are in freefall at present.  Moreover, weighing us down even further are the household and corporate debt, as well as the damage in the banking sector.  All these things will weigh on consumption and an investment for the foreseeable future, as we wind out of this balance sheet recession.  One could be talking about years of stagnant employment and growth unless there are major changes of policy, ultimately at a European level.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, however, as Ireland itself has a deficit requiring &euro;8.6 billion in adjustments over the next three years - the deficit itself of course is closer to &euro;13 billion or &euro;14 billion - the question is what Ireland can do.  Ireland can choose particular austerity measures, for example, that minimise the damage to growth, to vulnerable people at the very bottom and to employment.  Moreover, there are areas for which one can aim.  For example, when one is considering taxation measures, the worst thing one can do is to tax low income workers.  They spend all their money in the economy, it has negative implications for the labour market and so on.  On the other hand, the least damaging areas are those such as intergenerational wealth transfers, such as capital acquisitions tax in Ireland, or passive income, such as rental income.  That is the kind of smart fiscal consolidation in which one can engage.  Even though we are constrained, we still have choices.<\/p><p>  One of the worst things one can do is to cut the capital budget disproportionately.  The troika and, I imagine, virtually every economist in the world would heavily criticise any government that would cut its capital budget disproportionately, on which budget long-term growth and growth for people who are in long-term unemployment at present is contingent.  This is particularly the case in the construction sector, because the jobs from the boom time period are never coming back at the same level they reached previously.  Consequently, the worst thing one can do at this moment is to cut the capital budget.  The Government has been criticised in this regard by the troika.  We would also criticise this, as exacerbating the crisis and making it worse than it otherwise needs to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012110700013#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352300700,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I will be very quick.  In answer to the question about equality auditing and whether it happens elsewhere, yes it does.  It happens in Scotland and is done through the Government and Parliament.  They utilise the expertise of statutory groups and people who are expert in specific areas of inequality to put together a statement which is then responded to by the Government.  This is all done in the open.  The whole idea behind it is to increase transparency and debate.  If one is looking to take the heat out of budget discussions and is seeking a more calm and rational debate, this is one of the better ways of doing it.

What has been disappointing in terms of the banks' reaction to the mortgage arrears crisis is that in terms of their ability to cope, from an operational perspective, with the challenge of dealing with borrowers one on one and understand the borrower's financial situation and what is appropriate, the banks seem to have been slow about gearing up to be able to deal with that.  It is not a case, unfortunately, of them being in a position now where they can roll out broadly based solutions to everybody, because they have been taking some time to build the operational capacity to do that.  Significant progress has been made on that front in recent months, and the pilot projects undertaken by the Central Bank and others in terms of the MARS project has helped to get a better appreciation of what needs to be done in the process.

An important element that must be introduced on a more system-wide basis is the provision of equity to repair balance sheets that are broken.

Our understanding was that the banks were more than adequately recapitalised in terms of various rounds of recapitalisation.  There appears to be a divergence between the two main banks.  Bank of Ireland maintains that its &euro;3.5 billion is all new lending while AIB says approximately 17% of the &euro;3.5 billion - &euro;600 million - is new lending.  I appreciate what Mr. Moran said about preparing balance sheets but what is happening on the ground in a practical sense is that a typical SME has an overdraft facility of &euro;10,000.  SMEs are down to the wire and under constant pressure.  In many cases they are probably over-trading.  When the overdrafts come up for review they are effectively reclassified as a term loan and the overdraft facility is withdrawn.  There appears to be a difference between the two main banks.  Bank of Ireland states it is lending the full &euro;3.5 billion as new lending.  There must be some element of risk.  The credit guarantee scheme now being introduced should remedy that but perhaps the issue should be taken up with AIB in particular because in order to reduce unemployment we must get the SME sector to flourish again.  One cannot do that without credit.  AIB came before the committee first and then Bank of Ireland came before us.

Therefore, those discussions are in some greater respects almost on a bilateral basis in terms of the solutions available from the European Central Bank.  On what is referred to as the viable banks and the capitalisation by the State of those banks, we have a parallel process which is about seeking recapitalisation of those banks or, in effect, an exchange of the existing shares we have in them for an investment by the ESM in those banks directly.

I advocate pressing the ECB to give Ireland a break by funding the banks more directly with more funds at the cost set by the European Central Bank.

In the view of most people, taxation imposed on the wealthiest is perceived as something which will not have a negative impact on the domestic economy but that, on the contrary, it will drive the domestic economy.

Perhaps it is a Government decision rather than a Department decision, but if it is possible perhaps Mr. Moran would consider releasing the no-policy-change document, which describes what would happen if we continued on without change for next year.

If it is going to work, it will require a massive change in the position of the banks.  Mr. Richie Boucher appeared before the committee last week and his performance was outrageous.  I lived and worked in the UK for a number of years and, in my view, if the chief executive of a UK bank had treated a House of Commons select committee in the way he treated this committee, there would be widespread calls for his or her resignation.  He refused to answer my question as to whether Bank of Ireland had engaged in any debt surrender on unsustainable mortgages, even though he answered the question before.  He also refused to say whether Bank of Ireland would even consider the possibility of debt surrender as part of personal insolvency legislation.  Mr. Masding, the chief executive of Permanent TSB, essentially said the same.  We know AIB has done very little in that regard.  We have seen a consistent and robust position from the banks which states that they will surrender nothing unless absolutely forced to do so.  The personal insolvency legislation does not force them to do anything, which definitely makes the negotiation more interesting.

We have now moved the oversight of NAMA and our involvement in what is effectively the protection of the State's interest with respect to the assets that NAMA holds into the shareholder management unit, SMU.  It is part of an exercise to consolidate, because I do not see a difference in terms of the economic interests that the State owns, whether it owns them through a shareholding in the banks or indeed through exposure to the ultimate recovery of NAMA assets.  It now follows a process.  I am not sure of the exact number of people in the SMU but it is probably approximately 20.

I also thank the committee for agreeing to meet at 10 a.m. rather than 9.30 a.m. as I had another meeting in which to participate.<\/p><p>  The 2012 Estimate provided for a net sum of &euro;207.9 million.  Net outturn this year is expected to be approximately &euro;238 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;30 million.  I must emphasise this Supplementary Estimate for the Army pensions Vote will be met by an appropriate saving on the defence Vote.  It is, therefore, a technical Supplementary Estimate with no extra demand on the Exchequer over what was initially voted for the Department of Defence for 2012.<\/p><p>  Following the move by the Government to the new performance budgeting format, expenditure under the Vote is now provided under a single programme entitled provision for defence forces pensions benefits.  The Army pensions Vote makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces.  The original Estimate provided a net sum of &euro;207.9 million to cover a total of over 11,600 pensioners in all categories, the majority of whom are Defence Forces pensioners.<\/p><p>  The number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to increase during the past year.  There are almost 12,000 pensioners of all categories paid by the Department of Defence.  This includes 10,047 retired members of the Permanent Defence Force, 1,666 spouses and children of deceased members and 212 spouses of deceased Old IRA veterans.  Subhead A2 is the main subhead of the Army pensions Vote.  It covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Defence Forces and their dependants.  It accounts for over 95% of all military pensions expenditure and is primarily demand-led as well as non-discretionary.  The original provision of &euro;204 million for this subhead will be inadequate to meet all requirements.  The gross shortfall on this subhead is estimated at &euro;29.9 million.  A shortfall of &euro;500,000 is also expected in appropriations-in-aid.  The overall supplementary requirement will be offset by expected savings of &euro;400,000 in subheads A1, A3 and A4 to A6, inclusive.  When these are taken into account, the net shortfall is &euro;30 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700002#A00400","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352282400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The Minister has stated the additional cost of pensions will be met from the savings accruing the fall-off in the threshold of 9,500.

I may be corrected by my officials if I am wrong, but my recollection is that we advertised for in the region of 600 personnel.  There were in the region of 10,000 applications which, once received, had to be assessed.  Following this, there was a process whereby individuals initially selected had to go through an interview and health checks.  A range of processes had to take place and we were not in a position to starting brining in people until September.

Pension payments are relatively predictable and fixed and this forms part of the discussions with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In the current financial climate and with limited resources it is important to stay within our resources.  In a sense, members of the Permanent Defence Force in 2012 whom we may have envisaged continuing in the force and for whom salary provision was made went into the pension stream and there was an <i>interregnum<\/i> in bringing people in.

They retired and then became entitled to their pensions as opposed to Army salaries and, effectively, we determined what recruitment was required and how it should be distributed between the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  For example, it is not a question of simply recruiting ordinary personnel but of identifying who should be recruited by way of cadets.  The work that was done after February allowed us to advertise in June.  We knew exactly where we were heading and could start bringing people into the Defence Forces in September after the preliminary work was done.  That created an envelope of money that had not been spent on salaries.  It was utilised for pensions and it meant that we stayed firmly within budget, which was important.

There are also several similar provisions on the Statute Book in so far as provision is made for the State to co-operate and exchange information with other states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700006#E03300","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<blockquote><br \/>In page 8, subsection (1), line 25, after &#8220;supplemented,&#8221; to insert &#8220;or deleted,&#8221;.<\/blockquote>This is merely a technical amendment intended to strengthen the wording of the related paragraph.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700006#E03700","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I am refusing to accept the amendment as it is not necessary.

This relates to offences which Europol is competent to prevent and combat.  Criminal offences are already defined in section 1, which refers to the offences &quot;for which Europol has competence&quot;.  It is, therefore, not necessary to refer to Europol's competence in section 12(1).<\/p><p>  I cannot accept amendment No. 18, which was tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  This amendment would require the Minister to list &quot;by way of guidelines&quot; the crimes for which Europol has competence.  Under section 1, a criminal offence is defined as &quot;an offence for which Europol has competence in accordance with Article 4 of the Council Decision&quot;.  As I stated in the context of an earlier amendment, crimes which fall within Europol's remit are organised crimes, terrorism and other forms of serious crimes affecting two or more member states.  The other forms of serious crimes are listed in the annex to the Council decision.  Europol also has competence in respect of related criminal offences as listed in Article 4.3  Given that the Council decision is scheduled to the Bill, that it lists the offences which come within the competence of Europol and that a reference to such offences is contained in section 1, I do not see what value would be added by requiring the further publication of information already contained in the Bill.  I am of the view that any person who wants to know the nature of the offences involved will consult the legislation.  When one reads the Bill, it is quite easy to discover what are the relevant offences.  I accept that in view of the amount of legislation coming forward, it is often difficult for Deputies to read every Bill in detail.  That which the Deputy is seeking to do is actually dealt with in the Bill.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 19 to 22, inclusive, introduce drafting corrections to section 12.  Three of these corrections are minor in nature but that contained in amendment No. 21 is more significant.  The latter relates to section 12(3).  Amendment No. 19 clarifies that compliance, with restrictions, on the use of data is subject to the power to waive such restrictions under section 12(3).  Amendment No. 20 corrects an oversight in section 12(2).  It proposes that in addition to the reference to &quot;a communicating third state&quot;, a reference to a third body, such as Europol or the European Anti-Fraud Office, should also have been included.  This amendment makes the necessary correction.  Amendment No. 22 makes a similar correction in section 12(4).<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 21 relates to section 12(3), which itself relates to the waiving of restrictions on the use of data imposed by other states or bodies.  The subsection permits the waiving of such restrictions in circumstances where a court, a legislative body or another body is acting in a supervisory role in respect of the competent authorities.  However, such waiving of restrictions requires the prior consultation of the communicating state or body.  By introducing this provision, we are bringing the Bill more into line with Article 19.2 of the Council decision.  Where the Council's decision can be used to interpret provisions of the Bill, it was considered that the existing section 12(3) went beyond what was required and that the waiving of any restriction should be limited to circumstances relating to the supervision of the designated competent authority.  If someone makes a complaint to a court, to the Data Protection Commissioner or to a governing authority within the State in respect of data, such data cannot be used or accessed where it has been provided by another state unless the agreement of said state is obtained in the first instance.  This is a technical amendment which brings the legislation into line with the Council's decision.  The existing provision contained in the Bill stands outside the framework and is too loose in nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F00800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 19:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (2), line 20, to delete &quot;Any restrictions&quot; and substitute &quot;Subject to subsection (3)*, any restrictions&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F01100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 20:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (2), line 21, to delete &quot;or a communicating third State&quot; and substitute the following:<br \/>&quot;, a communicating third state or a communicating third body&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F01300","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, lines 23 to 25, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>  &quot;(3) Where a court in the State, a legislative body or another body established by statute proposes, when supervising a designated competent authority to waive in accordance with law a restriction placed on information received from a communicating Member State, a communicating third state or a communicating third body, the relevant designated competent authority shall--<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) consult the communicating state or body concerned as respects the interests and views of that state or body in the matter, and<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) take all reasonable steps to convey those interests and views to the court, legislative body or supervising authority concerned.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F01500","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (4), line 27, after &quot;State&quot; to insert the following:<br \/>&quot;, a communicating third state or a communicating third body&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F01700","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 23 to 29, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F02100","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 31 and 32, to delete &quot;Data Protection Commissioner&quot; and substitute &quot;head of the national unit&quot;.<\/blockquote>  Amendments Nos. 23, 24, 25, 25<i>a<\/i> and 27 seek to streamline the manner in which individuals seek access to personal data processed by Europol.

The latter would then liaise with Europol in respect of the request.<\/p><p>  There are a number of reasons for amending the section in order that requests for access to personal data will be submitted directly to the national unit.  First, designating the Data Protection Commissioner under subsection (1) simply creates an extra layer in the application process.  Having consulted the latter's office, I am in a position to state that it is inappropriate for the commissioner to be designated for this purpose because the commissioner has a separate legal obligation under the Data Protection Act.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, for the Data Protection Commissioner to be involved in handling a request for data in the first instance.  Whereas the data protection officer to be appointed under the Bill will oversee compliance by the national unit, there would be no redress available if the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner were not to forward a request to that unit.  For these reasons, we are proposing the amendments to section 13.  Essentially, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is of the view that there is no need for people to make requests to it in the first instance and that people should submit their requests to the national unit.  If the latter does not comply, the Data Protection Commissioner will have a role to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F02200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (2), lines 33 and 34, to delete &quot;Data Protection Commissioner&quot; and substitute &quot;head of the national unit&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F02400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, lines 38 to 40, to delete subsection (3).<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F02600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25<i>a<\/i>:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (4), lines 41 and 42, to delete &quot;<i>subsection (3)<\/i>&quot; and substitute &quot;<i>subsection (2)<\/i>&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F02800","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 26:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (4), line 45, to delete &quot;30 days&quot; and substitute &quot;14 days&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F03000","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, subsection (5), lines 46 and 47, to delete &quot;designated competent authorities&quot; and substitute &quot;national unit&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F03200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 28:<blockquote><br \/>In page 10, subsection (7), line 12, to delete &quot;authorities&quot; and substitute &quot;authority concerned&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F03400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 29:<blockquote><br \/>In page 10, subsection (8), to delete line 15 and substitute the following:<br \/>&quot;to a person by a legal or factual error in data processed by Europol,&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F03600","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F04100","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1352284800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 30:<blockquote><br \/>In page 10, subsection (1), line 31, after &quot;of&quot; to insert the following:<br \/>&quot;any of the following persons in the performance of their functions as&quot;.<\/blockquote>These are minor drafting amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700007#F04200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352285400,"counter":429,"content":"<p>l move amendment No. 31:<blockquote><br \/>In page 10, subsection (1), line 43, to delete &#8220;facts or&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012110700008#G00300","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1352285400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 32:<blockquote><br \/><b><\/b>In page 11, subsection (1), line 13, to delete &#8220;passing&#8221; and substitute &#8220;commencement&#8221;. <\/blockquote>This is a minor amendment to clarify that the confirmation provided in section 17 applies from the commencement of the Act and not from the passing of the Act.

A summary note on the petition concerned and also the research carried out has been circulated to members.  In order to qualify for the third level option on the back to education allowance, in addition to a number of other qualifying conditions, a person must have been in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum of 234 days.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>  I will read a background to the subject of this discussion to give the context for it.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga undertook two investigations arising from complaints made to his office in regard to the procedures adopted by the Department of Social Protection to award bonus marks for proficiency in Irish and in English in internal promotions competitions.  An coimisin&eacute;ir made certain recommendations to the Department arising from these investigations.  The Department subsequently confirmed to an coimisin&eacute;ir that it did not intend to implement the recommendations made in either of the two investigations.  An coimisin&eacute;ir accordingly made a report of the matter to the Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to section 26(5) of the Official Languages Act 2003.  <\/p><p>   The committee met An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga on 2 May 2012 and considered the report further on 18 July 2012.  Arising from that meeting, correspondence issued to the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In its reply the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggested that the committee might also wish to consider inviting representatives of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, the body that regulates public service recruitment, and the Public Appointments Service, the main recruitment body for the Civil Service, on the basis that both bodies would be in a position to provide valuable input into the matters under consideration.  Representatives of each of the four bodies are available to make a statement to the committee.  The text of statements supplied by each body are included in this document and a paragraph number is provided for ease of reference.<\/p><p>   In the report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga identified in the interpretation of the Department of Finance circulars, and especially at what point during a competition for promotion should credit be given for proficiency in Irish as a central issue.  That is the report I mentioned earlier.<\/p><p>  The findings of the An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga  were as follows: a statutory requirement for Government Departments, including the Department of Social Protection, to award bonus marks for language competency in internal competitions, as set out in circulars 43\/75 and circular 30\/90; it would be <i>ultra vires<\/i> for the Department of Social Projection to amend, on its own initiative, by means of an office notice the provision of circulars which secure rights for individuals when those circulars have been issued by a specific Minister by virtue of and pursuant to powers confirmed by section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act; the relevant circulars do not permit the restriction of bonus marks only to those who secure a place on the final panel; and that subsection 1(d) of circular 43\/75 clearly directs that &quot; A knowledge of Irish will, however, be one of the factors which will be assessed in selecting staff for promotion&quot;.  Where bonus marks are not awarded to a suitably qualified person, that person's rights are contravened.<\/p><p>  The recommendations of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga were that the Department revise the results of these two promotional competitions to ensure that bonus marks, proficiency in both Irish and English were properly awarded to the complainants and also that the complainants should receive any benefit which might arise from the revised marking.  An coimisin&eacute;ir also recommended that the Department ensure that the provisions of the relevant circulars were fully employed in future in all its promotion competitions and that the Department inform the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Public Appointment Service and the Public Service Appointments Commission of the findings and recommendations of the investigations.<\/p><p>  I note I am being summoned as a vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.  There are a number of witnesses before us.  I propose to suspend proceedings until after the vote.  I apologise to the witnesses and ask for their indulgence.  We will begin with the witnesses' statements when we reconvene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012110700005#F00300","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352307300,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don choiste as ucht cuireadh a thabhairt don Roinn Coimirce S&oacute;isiala&iacute; aitheasc a thabhairt don choiste.

We thank the committee for the opportunity to clarify the policy position on the awarding of bonus marks for proficiency in the Irish language and will focus our comments on chapter 3 of both investigations.<\/p><p>  In conformity with instructions from the secretariat and on foot of discussions with the committee clerk, we will  not be commenting on those aspects of the investigations that cover issues currently under appeal to the Supreme Court.  <\/p><p>  It is useful to set out the responsibilities of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the issues raised by An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for the regulation of the Civil Service under section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956.  This includes specific responsibility for recruitment and promotion.  The section is as follows:<blockquote>17(1) The Minister shall be responsible for the following matters:(<i>a<\/i>) the regulation and control of the Civil Service, <br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the classification, re-classification, numbers and remuneration of civil servants,<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) the fixing of <blockquote>(i) the terms and conditions of service of civil servants, and  <br \/>(ii) the conditions governing the promotion of civil servants.<\/blockquote>(2) The Minister may, for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, make such arrangements as he thinks fit and may cancel or vary those arrangements.<\/blockquote>  Under section 17(1), the Minister is responsible for, <i>inter alia, <\/i>the fixing of the conditions governing the promotion of civil servants.  Crucially, under section 17(2), the Minister may, for the purpose of subsection (1), make such arrangements as he thinks fit and may cancel or vary those arrangements. <\/p><p>  In relation to Irish language proficiency in the Civil Service, the Minister has, notably, exercised those powers under section 17(1)(<i>c<\/i>)(ii) on three occasions since 1975, by way of circulars and circular letters.  The Government decided in 1974 that, <i>inter alia<\/i>, knowledge of Irish would no longer be obligatory for entry to Civil Service positions and would not be obligatory for eligibility for promotion.  In November 1975, the then Department of the Public Service issued circular 43\/75, setting out changes consequential on that decision.  The circular provided that in promotion competitions credit would be available at a rate of 10%, subject to candidates having satisfied Irish qualification requirements.  Circular 43\/75, Irish Requirements in the Civil Service, provides that proficiency in Irish and English will be given equal credit in recruitment and establishment competitions and candidates can present in Irish or English or both.  Those shown to be proficient in both languages were to get credit for this in determining the order of merit.  In respect of promotion competitions, knowledge of Irish was to be one of the factors assessed in selecting staff for promotion. <\/p><p>  In 1990, the Department of Finance issued circular 30\/90, Credit for Proficiency in Both Irish and English in Confined Promotional Competitions.  This varied the conditions applying to the language proficiency scheme.  The circular provided that candidates would get a reduced credit for Irish at promotion competitions and that in order to get the credit they would have to re-sit the Irish qualification test from time to time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012110700012#O01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Coleman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352310900,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Beidh go leor cairde agam sa d&aacute; Roinn seo nuair a bh&eacute;as muid cr&iacute;ochnaithe, ar aon n&oacute;s.<\/p><p>  T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith bu&iacute;och do In&iacute;on U&iacute; Coleman as na freagra&iacute; a thug s&iacute;.

To start with the latter ones, circular 43\/75, which is the original circular, is clear in regard to recruitment and establishment competitions.  It defines that the Irish will apply in determining the order of merit.  Recruitment competitions are open recruitment competitions that are advertised.  Establishment competitions relate to people who have been brought into the Civil Service who may have been appointed in an unestablished capacity who then had an opportunity to convert to an established capacity.  That explains those two terms.<\/p><p>  The issue regarding internal promotional competitions is that the circular was not prescriptive in terms of the order of merit.  Those words were not included in the circular but, as I said earlier, the practice for the past 37 years has been that this is the way Irish proficiency marks have been applied, at the final order of merit stage.  This was the policy of the Department.  We were satisfied that it was the correct way to apply the policy.  At the end of the day there is an onus on us in terms of resourcing and recruitment policy to ensure we get the best people into the Civil Service and that they are fully competent to carry out the duties.  As my colleagues in the CPSA and in the PAS have outlined in their submissions to the committee, we are required to ensure that we get the best people in, and in recruitment processes that we define the skills and competencies for particular posts when we are recruiting.  If Irish is specified as a core competency for a particular job, then it would be assessed as part of the recruitment or promotion process.  It would be one of the competences that would be adjudicated on in the selection process at the interview stage or the earlier stages.<\/p><p>  I am trying to remember the Acting Chairman's other questions.  The High Court case - the de B&uacute;rca challenge - related to the application of Irish proficiency in a particular competition and as it happened it was not a promotion competition and there are issues there.  I do not want to go into the detail of the case because we will be before the Supreme Court on appeal.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's main focus seems to be on the point or stage in the competition at which the Irish is applied, which is not an issue that is addressed in the de B&uacute;rca case.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has legal responsibility for establishing the terms and conditions for the Civil Service.  The circulars are clear in regard to recruitment and establishment competitions in terms of the point in the process where the proficiency for Irish is applied.  It is not prescriptive in regard to the others but the custom and practice for 37 years, which is a significant period, has been that it is applied at the final order of merit stage, and we are satisfied that this is the correct approach to adopt.<\/p><p>  It is fair to say that An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga is the regulator in regard to Irish language and we fully accept that role.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has a statutory responsibility in determining the terms and conditions for civil servants and in varying and changing those if required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012110700014#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Coleman"},{"type":"speech","time":1352311500,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I appreciate that Ms Coleman cannot go into the details of the case but there has been the case of de B&uacute;rca <i>v<\/i>.

The Public Appointments Service took over the operational aspects of recruitment and selection previously exercised by the office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners.  In the course of the transition between organisations, PAS retained most of the staff and the organisational knowledge of the earlier bodies.<\/p><p>  The relevance of this is that the PAS and, prior to that, the offices of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners, has been the body primarily responsible for the application of the provision of additional credit for Irish proficiency, as provided for in the Department of Finance Circulars 43\/75 and 30\/90.  PAS has been administering this scheme since its inception in 1975 where it has applied to open recruitment and interdepartmental promotion competitions.<\/p><p>  PAS runs assessment processes in a manner that ensures standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness are achieved.  The fundamental building block for this is the identification in advance of the range of skills and competencies required for effective performance.  It is essential that any candidate who is placed on the final order of merit has demonstrated satisfactorily that he meets the required standard for all of these skills and competencies.  In certain instances proficiency in Irish may be set as an essential requirement but in the majority of cases, bonus marks are awarded for demonstrated proficiency.<\/p><p>  The scheme for awarding additional marks for demonstrating language proficiency in Irish is intended to introduce an additional distinguishing factor between candidates who clearly meet all of the essential criteria, thereby allowing those with competence in Irish to achieve a higher placing on the panel.  For this reason, the credit for Irish proficiency is added to the overall marks after the final order of merit based on the scores awarded for essential skills and competencies is determined by the interview board.  Awarding credit at an earlier stage would risk the appointment of a candidate who does not fully meet the essential criteria.  This has been the manner of application of this scheme since its inception in 1975.  The Public Appointments Service has worked closely with the relevant Departments, the CPSA, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in the intervening years to ensure the scheme is always applied in the manner directed by the Minister.<\/p><p>  The PAS recognises the role of the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and would be happy to work with him in looking at ways to foster the competence in the Irish language through the selection process.  The service was slightly surprised that the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga did not engage in any consultation on the matter in the course of his investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012110700015#R01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1352312100,"counter":577,"content":"<p>An bhfuil ceist ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012110700015#R01700","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1352312100,"counter":578,"content":"<p>N&iacute;or mhaith liom &eacute; a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il amach, an fear bocht.

First, it is not our function to examine the overall standards of the Irish language.  However, if a Department perceives that it has a need - either from its own research or from comments from An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga on the performance against its scheme - we will be quite happy to introduce a competition which would favour people with the Irish language, and have done so on many occasions over the years.  The last time we had a competition which was specifically focused on people with competence in Irish was in 2007 for executive officers and clerical officers.  Unfortunately, the response from applicants with that competence was low.  We had about 113 applicants for the executive officer position, of which only about 68 came to sit tests.  With regard to the clerical officer position, there were 126 applicants and only about 60 came to sit tests.  There is therefore an issue that is wider than just the immediate Civil Service, because they were national competitions which would have been publicised through our website.<\/p><p>  As regards the demand for Irish and how it is being fulfilled, we would not have a role in specifically identifying that.  We are fully in compliance with our scheme in relation to meeting the Irish and English requirements of people who wish to apply for Civil Service posts.  It would be fair to say, however, that despite the efforts we have made, of those candidates who have an actual registered identity on our website, only 0.62% of those have expressed an interest in doing their transactions through Irish.<\/p><p>  Of those who have applied for competitions over the past three years, only 0.26% of all applications we have received have been done on that basis.  That is with full backing, so there are issues regarding the level of demand that would manifest itself, certainly for ourselves, although I am not quite sure about other Departments.<\/p><p>  As regards the PSNI, we would not be averse to having a scheme which would foster or encourage people with Irish to apply.  It would have to be done in the context of them meeting the overall standards in relation to all the posts.  In the course of our recruitment, we also look after professional posts, including medical consultants and engineers.  The Irish scheme equally applies to them in recruiting for posts.  Clearly, however, a medical consultant has to meet the medical requirements and cannot be brought over that hurdle by their competence in Irish.  So that tension is there all the time - that one is trying to get the best people in.  There is no direct conflict between people with or without Irish in terms of meeting those competencies.  Obviously, there are some people who may have Irish who will not clear all the hurdles that are required to get in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012110700016#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. P&aacute;draig Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1352312700,"counter":581,"content":"<p>What about Mr. Love's own opinion on the commissioner's report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012110700016#S00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352312700,"counter":582,"content":"<p>As regards the commissioner's report, it is not the way we would apply it.

It is very useful for us to have the opportunity to discuss our work here.  We appeared before the communications committee in its previous form in January and some of the members here today were present then.  On that day we were mainly discussing electronic communications services.  It is a great opportunity today to talk about post.  I very much agree with the statement the Chairman issued last night that good communications with stakeholders is very important for us both in informing and in delivering on our strategy.<\/p><p>  I am accompanied by my fellow commissioner, Mr. Kevin O'Brien, Mr. Stephen Brogan, our postal regulatory manager and Mr. Seamas Plunkett, our postal operations manager.  We have a short presentation which, I hope, has been made available to the members of the committee.  We will speak to that and would be delighted to take questions seeking clarifications as we go along or to have a discussion at the end.<\/p><p>  Our mandate comes directly from legislation.  We are the national regulatory authority under European law and the independent regulator under Irish communications law.  Last year major new legislation, the Postal Services Act, was passed.  That gave us a considerable number of new responsibilities as well as extending existing responsibilities.  I believe the Act contains 66 postal sections and while I do not propose to go through them here, it is complex, demanding and important legislation and I know a number of you will have been involved in debating it.<\/p><p>  Under the Act we have two key statutory functions: to ensure the provision of a universal postal service that meets the reasonable needs of users; and to monitor and ensure compliance by postal service providers with obligations imposed by them in the provision of postal services.  We also have three statutory objectives: to promote the development of the postal sector and in particular the availability of a universal postal service within, to and from the State at an affordable price for the benefit of all the users; to promote the interests of postal service users within the community; and, subject to the first overriding objective, to facilitate the development of competition and innovation in the market for postal service provision.  That is in order to ensure that postal service users derive maximum benefit in terms of choice, price and quality.  It is interesting to note that there is a clear hierarchy of objectives with the first objective taking priority over the other two.<\/p><p>  There have been important changes to the overall scheme of regulation for post both from the Act passed here and from the third EU postal directive which liberalised all postal markets across Europe.  Obviously we have had to respond to that and we published our strategy in the knowledge of the overall liberalisation that has occurred.  We are also very conscious of the significant changes taking place in the Irish postal market in common with all postal markets around the world.  These are changes of a structural kind with in particular a very substantial move towards electronic communication.  However, these structural changes have been also greatly exacerbated by the cyclical recession and the financial crisis we are experiencing.  Obviously that has had a very significant impact on letter volumes, which have fallen by approximately 30% in the past five years.  Furthermore this trend appears to be continuing and there is a significant threat in particular from electronic substitution, e-mail, texts, social media and so on.<\/p><p>  The flip side of that threat is the opportunity particularly in the area of parcels that comes from the rapid growth of the fulfilment of online transactions - Internet commerce.  In addition there is continued growth in advertising mail - direct mail - where the volumes in Ireland are low by comparison with international standards.<\/p><p>  It is worth taking stock and recognising that post is one form of communication.  An interesting report, published in July by the international postal corporation, the Boston Consulting Group, looked at all the different types of communication that exist.  Judged by units of communication, post in 2000 accounted for 10% of the total when measured along with e-mailing, phoning and texting.  According to the study, by 2010 it was just 1% of the total of all communication.  That is measured by volume and not value, but nevertheless it shows that in the modern world there are many forms of communication and that presents a particular challenge to the postal sector.<\/p><p>  The next slide has a graph that shows a strong historical linkage between overall economic activity and the volume of post, so as the economy improved the post improved with it and the same was also true on the downside.  However, that linkage in Ireland and in other countries appears to have been broken in recent years largely because of technological change and e-substitution, meaning that as the economy has recovered somewhat from the worst of the crisis in 2009 and we hope will continue to recover, the extent to which postal volumes recover with that is much less.  That presents a great challenge for the postal sector and puts particular pressure obviously not only on revenues but also on the need to manage cost in line with that.<\/p><p>  When considering why postal volumes do not recover in the same way, it is important to consider that 80% of the volume of post comes from business organisations, large public organisations and charities.  Most of that is one way, which is from business to consumers.  When people are under pressure economically they try to manage their costs as best they can and in some cases they do that by communicating with their customers through their websites, by e-mail or text, or through social media, including Facebook and so on.  Once they have invested in doing business that way, it is less likely they will revert to using the post.  That is one of the reasons when people have moved away from the post it is harder to get them back.  That is a significant point in considering the challenges facing the postal sector.<\/p><p>  The next slide contains an extract from our postal strategy, a copy of which we supplied to the committee in advance.  I do not propose to speak through the entire detail of that strategy because I want to have time for a proper discussion today.  I will simply highlight the mission ComReg has for the postal sector.  Through effective and relevant regulation, our mission is to promote the development of the postal sector, to ensure the provision and availability of an affordable, high quality universal postal service; to promote the interests of postal service users; and to facilitate the development of competition and innovation in postal service provision.  We also have a number of high-level goals and I will ask Mr. O'Brien to talk about them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Chisholm"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352280900,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I again thank the members of the committee for the opportunity to appear here today.

Pages 6 and 7 give some detail on the primary goal of ensuring the provision and availability of the universal postal service.<\/p><p>  An Post is designated under the 2011 Act as the universal postal service provider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352281500,"counter":610,"content":"<p>The actions which we are taking are published as part of our postal strategy.  We will continue to update in the months ahead.  We believe in transparency and accountability for our actions as public servants.  As such, we believe it is important there is clarity around what we have done and will do.<\/p><p>  The first action is monitoring compliance of the universal postal service with all obligations under the Act, which relate in the main to tariff requirements, accounting and quality of service and access to infrastructure, including access points.  The second action, which took up a great deal of our time earlier in the year, was the setting of the new regulatory framework in terms of the scope of regulation and the precise definitions of what services need to be provided under the universal postal service.  This is a key building block for our work, on the back of which we are able to take forward much else of what we are doing.<\/p><p>  In October, we consulted on and finalised the procedures for our involvement in any disputes that arise for access by postal service providers to the postal network.  We also finalised this postal strategy statement following public consultation.  We are grateful for the submissions we received in this regard from a number of interested parties in the industry.  Those submissions have also been published.  Members may be aware that in October we also published an update on the review of An Post's price application, in respect of which much of the work was done by ComReg, with some work being done by an expert economic agency called Frontier Economics.  In the interests of transparency, that report has been published.  We expect to receive shortly An Post's finalised application for a price increase.  As stated, we will progress this matter as a priority.<\/p><p>  We also intend to publish before the end of the year a consultation on An Post's price application for certain of its postal services.  Once we have received the fully valid and complete application, we will consult on the matter.  We would expect our response to this to be published in the first quarter of 2013.  We also hope to approve or amend terms and conditions for the universal postal service subject to receipt of the proposed terms and conditions from An Post.  These needed to be varied following the decision we made on the scope of regulation published in July.<\/p><p>  In 2013, we will continue to monitor activities on compliance.  As I stated, we also hope to publish our response to the price application during the first quarter of 2013.  We also have to review all of the postal service providers' codes of practice from the point of view of ensuring they provide proper protections to users, as required by the legislation.  We also need to set dispute resolution procedures for postal service users in terms of complaints, compensation and so on.  Under the Act, An Post, as the universal service provider, has the right to apply, where it believes it has cause, for funding in this regard.  To facilitate this, we propose to publish a draft methodology and to consult on this in the first quarter of 2013.  We hope to have this in place in the second quarter of the year.  There is also to be a price cap on the universal service provider.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Chisholm","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352282100,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.

This is a critical factor.  ComReg is responsible for ensuring An Post has appropriate incentives for efficiency with regard to the price cap and any assessment of the universal service burden, which is also under European law.  A second factor is that An Post may need to consider price increases with regard to the formerly reserved area of the core letter business and other areas.  There were a number of price increases in the early part of the year.  As I stated earlier, we are in the process of dealing with a price application for core letters.  From our point of view, appropriate price increases that are in line with the requirements of the 2011 Act will form part of the overall response to the situation in which the company finds itself.<\/p><p>  Outside ComReg's area, undoubtedly An Post will need to develop other streams of revenue and make the most it possibly can of the considerable assets it has, not least its reputation and reach throughout the country.

How much has ComReg spent on external expertise in 2012?<\/p><p>  I do not know whether the problem is with ComReg itself or with the regulations, but it is extraordinary that nowhere in its mandate for the regulation of postal services does it talk about value for money for taxpayers.  There is reference to value for money for customers but not for taxpayers.  In respect of ComReg's function to facilitate competition within the market, what is the line between facilitation and promotion?  Given that the performance indicators ComReg uses to monitor postal services are key to any future decisions impacting those services, will the delegates elaborate on them?  I understand PricewaterhouseCoopers does an annual performance review of An Post and that its indicators are consistently 3% higher than those shown by ComReg.  We need to know what indicators the regulator is using and whether they are made known to all of the postal agencies.<\/p><p>  I am particularly interested in ComReg's recent decision to appeal a judgment of the High Court to the Supreme Court.  As I understand it, An Post and not ComReg will have to bear the legal costs associated with this matter.  In a context where An Post is set to lose &euro;27 million in 2012, I find it difficult to understand how this decision of the regulator, having already fined An Post &euro;12 million, will help the company to fulfil its remit of delivering post to customers within this island and beyond.  If the High Court found that the office I ran was working beyond its mandate and straying into an area in which I had no expertise, I would only run to the Supreme Court if, as in this instance, I knew I would not have to meet the ensuing costs myself.  It is extraordinary that ComReg has made the decision to appeal this matter instead of finding some way, through mediation, discussion and negotiation, to resolve it without jeopardising the very industry the office was established to protect and promote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700007#G00400","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1352282700,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates from ComReg and thank them for their comprehensive presentation.

We should not leave the room until we get to the bottom of these important issues.<\/p><p>  Only days after representatives of ComReg met this committee last January, they publicly announced their intention to pursue An Post through the courts, which is likely to result in a &euro;12 million fine for An Post.

I thank him for his summary of the role that we try to perform.  I agree generally that we try to be a watchdog for the consumer, to uphold the public interest and to ensure the development of the postal sector.  We are not a watchdog for the taxpayer.  We see that as a role for the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Finance, who are the shareholders in An Post.  It is also the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and other such bodies.  We do not represent the taxpayer but we certainly represent the consumer and the user of the postal sector.  We were asked for our view of the sustainability of the postal services in rural areas.  Our view is that the universal postal service must be maintained and that provides for the collection and delivery every day of the working week.  It is essential.  In order to make that economically viable, as I tried to indicate in my opening remarks, it is very dependent on postal volumes being maintained.  It will depend on the postal service providers to provide a high quality, efficient and valuable service to their customers.<\/p><p>  From our point of view we want to give encouragement and incentives to provide an efficient service that provides quality and choice.  We will also undoubtedly work on the quality of written communication.  I apologise to the Deputy that he finds some of our expressions gobbledegook and we will work harder at that.  I totally agree that all interested parties, including ordinary members of the public, should be able to read, understand and comprehend what we produce.  We endeavour to reach that standard.  We will try harder in future.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington also spoke on the postal matter at our hearing in January 2012.  I will try to answer his questions directly.  In response to his question on service providers, we have received five authorisation applications and notifications.  The answer to his question on the number of disputes that have arisen is zero.  I should, however, note that the procedures were only finalised in October 2012, which is a relatively short time for disputes to have arisen.  The Deputy also asked about the price application.  We expect to have a finalised application in the next few weeks if not days and we will publish a consultation on that before the end of the year.  We expect to have our response in the first quarter of next year.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington expressed some surprise at the different hierarchies that we have under the legislation.  The legislation makes it very clear that the primary objective of ComReg is to preserve the universal postal service and that takes priority over the other two objectives.  Deputy Harrington noted that we included in our presentation a chart that shows that the historic link between postal service revenues and overall activity in the economy appears to have been weakened, if not broken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700008#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Chisholm","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352283900,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of ComReg for the presentation and coming before the committee.  It is disappointing that the witnesses are using the excuse of matters being <i>sub judice<\/i>  in not answering certain questions.  A High Court decision has been made and nothing that would be said here or elsewhere will change that, even if the matter goes to the Supreme Court.  We will not give ammunition to anybody else, taking into account what has already been said.  It is crucial for us to find out what methodology can be used by ComReg in judging performance and how it came to a stage where a fine will be imposed.  The fine is a massive amount of money.  Has any other company faced a fine of that nature?  The company in question would not be as rich as many others and the fine seems to be very excessive.  Perhaps the witnesses can tell me if any other company faced a bigger fine than this?<\/p><p>  Are complaints from customers used in the measurement process, bringing an action against a company or imposing a fine?  An Post has one way of measuring its performance and ComReg has a different method; they do not meet in the middle as there is a slight difference between them.  Surely there should be a common way of judging the performance of a company.  I do not know why there are two different methods, as it does not seem to make sense.  As far as I can gather, in other European countries there is a common methodology that is widely recognised.  Mr. Chisholm mentioned the use of consultancy firms, giving the figure of &euro;1.3 million.  I presume there are consultancies in dealing with companies other than An Post.  There must massive amounts of money in question if this is only to deal with An Post.  I would like a flavour of the range and costs in using outside advisers, consultancy firms, etc.<\/p><p>  As far as I am aware, An Post has one of the lowest postal rates in Europe, although Mr. Chisholm may tell me if it has not.  I do not recall an increase being imposed for many years.  This can be contrasted with ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, which are making millions of euro.  I cannot fathom how those increases are justified.  When the privatisation leading to the current ESB and Bord G&aacute;is began, many areas were fattened up in order to sell to private concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700009#J00200","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352284500,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I will not be able to stay until the end of the meeting because I must attend another meeting, but it is important to ask my questions.  Without referring to individual cases or what might be before the courts, I have a simple and fair question for ComReg.  As a publicly funded regulator set up by a statute of the Oireachtas and answerable to the Houses, does it recognise the legitimacy of the High Court and accept judgments of same?  It seems that ComReg does not.  As a wing of the country's governance, that a statutory regulator would take an <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i> approach to the High Court is concerning.  The Government will need to reflect on this serious issue.<\/p><p>  I will not refer to a particular case, but this smacks of the good old days of 2008 when people in Ireland's public services believed that there was an endless train of money and that they could swan up to the &quot;Four Goldmines&quot; at the drop of a hat because someone else was paying for it.  Someone is paying in this instance as well.<\/p><p>  It was mentioned that ComReg is not meant to be a watchdog for the taxpayer.  That ComReg is not a watchdog is perfectly clear.  It is not a watchdog for anyone bar itself.  ComReg seems to be putting on a front for the High Court while making it clear that, come hell or high water, ComReg's legitimacy and purpose to exist will not be challenged.  This is remarkable.<\/p><p>  An Post is effectively operating on its own in a regulated market.  In some instances, ComReg expects next-day delivery services to include the likes of Good Friday.  Since Job was a boy, everyone has known that little occurs in Ireland on Good Friday.  Deputy Harrington is correct, in that costs have been placed on An Post time and again for years.  ComReg seems to believe that An Post is a hopeless case that cannot deliver post on time, yet the regulator cannot identify where the gaps are.<\/p><p>  ComReg will disregard a judgment of the High Court and appeal to the Supreme Court because An Post rather than ComReg pays for it.  The penny needs to drop.  There is no difference between the consumer and the taxpayer in this instance.  They are one and the same.  The Government must reflect on what the regulator is being allowed to do at a significant cost to the taxpayer.  At a time when the country is bankrupt, going to the Four Courts at the drop of a hat, incurring significant costs and showing affront to the High Court is immoral for any wing of Ireland's governance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700010#K00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352284500,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I respect and take note of the opinions given.

The only reason we have for bringing appeals against decisions of the High Court is when we think it is absolutely merited on questions of law.  We brought an appeal in regard to the premium rate services sector earlier this year where a stay had been granted to protect certain operators in that sector from the full effects of a consumer protection code we had put in place.  A judicial review was also made against that decision.   We had to appeal the decision of the judge in that matter because we thought it merited the appeal.  Following that appeal to the Supreme Court, the judicial review was dropped and the code is now fully in effect.  We had to take that action in that case.  Incidentally, this has been at no cost to the taxpayer as our costs in that matter have been fully recognised by the other party.  We take action extremely sparingly and where it is essential.<\/p><p>  Section 52(9) of the postal legislation states that a determination of the High Court on the hearing of an appeal under this section, which is what happened in this case in that it was a judicial review and an appeal, is final except that by leave of the High Court an appeal on a specified question of law shall lie to the Supreme Court.  Getting heard by the Supreme Court is not automatic and it must be determined whether or not it will take the case.  That is the legislative provision we are acting under in bringing an appeal.

As it also relates to the question from Deputy Harrington, I will try to deal with both of those.  As to whether we agree it, obviously - since we have a statutory function to set, on an independent basis, what the correct target should be - initially it is not an agreed target but one on which we consulted.  We received views and representations from An Post and other parties but we did not exactly agree it with An Post.  It is the same for any other regulated activity.  If one were to ask Eircom or any other regulated business what kind of arrangement or target would suit it or what it would like, that would be an agreed target, but it would not necessarily be the most appropriate target having regard to the public interest and the desire to improve the standards of quality in the interests of users and consumers.  We set it.  It was also the case that An Post accepted that target once we had set it and worked towards it, making considerable progress up until 2010.  Then, unfortunately, that progress stopped and left our estimate 10 percentage points short.  That is not to say it is agreed with An Post, but the position of the company, as many have stated in public, is that quality of service is of paramount importance and vital to its ability to sustain the universal service and to satisfy its customers.  On that we agree with An Post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700012#M01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alex Chisholm"},{"type":"speech","time":1352285700,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Is it fully transparent, so that it may know what it is being measured against?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012110700012#M01600","speaker":"1019"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352285700,"counter":693,"content":"<p>It is absolutely transparent and is in line with the CEN standard.

As mentioned earlier, we had an application at the end of last year.  Some information which was missing took a while to collect from An Post.  Once we had it all together we made an assessment of it and when we shared that assessment with An Post it said it would amend its price application.  That happened last month.
