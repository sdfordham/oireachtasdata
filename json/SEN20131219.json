In the past, however, debate was permitted on the Appropriation Bill, which is a practice that should be restored.   It is a dereliction of our duty simply to sign a cheque for &euro;47.5 billion without debate.  I realise that the vast majority of the money has already been spent and there is little we can do about it.  That is why the Fianna F&aacute;il Party abstained last year when a vote was called by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p> <p>That is the reason Fianna F&aacute;il abstained last year when a vote was called by Sinn F&eacute;in.  We did not wish either to endorse the Government's spending plans or to take the money back from the people who got it, which would be the effect of a &quot;No&quot; vote.  However, it deserves far more scrutiny.  The Seanad does not have a great deal of power over the spending of money, but the obligation on it to pass the Appropriation Bill provides us with an opportunity to have an influence on it for the benefit of society.  On that basis, I oppose the Order of Business.  There should be a formal debate.  We will assess the position with regard to the Bill when that vote arises, but I am not inclined to oppose it.  Unfortunately, however, I am not inclined to support it either.  It is a difficult choice.<\/p><p> The Seanad should have a full debate on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, allegations.  The Seanad has been central to the statements made, particularly by my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, and, in the past, by Senator Mark Daly and Senator Lorraine Higgins.  The allegations Senator Darragh O'Brien made yesterday are so serious that he went to the Garda fraud squad.  They also involve a political question which he raised yesterday, so it would be appropriate to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the conduct of the Department of Finance and of NAMA.  We should have a full debate on the issue rather than simply pass the buck to the Garda, which has a very important role.  I compliment Senator Darragh O'Brien.  He received some criticism to the effect that he was just another politician grandstanding but, unlike some politicians who have gone to the Garda in the past, he refused to be accompanied by photographers or the press.  Such was the seriousness of his duty he was accompanied by his solicitor.  That was the right approach and I compliment him on doing this properly and in the privacy of the Garda station.  He did not go to his local Garda station with photographers but went straight to the fraud squad which has <i>seisin<\/i>of this matter.<\/p><p> The main issue that will affect the people of Ireland this Christmas is the HSE service plan.  It is shameful that this fraudulent document is being presented to the Oireachtas immediately before Christmas and is to come into effect in January.  It is the same on-the-hoof approach that the Government adopted with the health plan in the budget.  The spin doctors have been busy portraying the reduction in the amount of money to be saved from medical card cuts as a huge victory, but the reality is that 100,000 people will lose their medical cards under the service plan.  That is a shame and a disgrace.  It is a shame that the Labour Party and Fine Gael are vying to claim the credit for that cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900002#A00700","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387449000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We are cleaning up your mess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900003#B00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1387449000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>You are not.

Many of the people who went to the front in 1914, particularly people from Dublin, did so because they were living in extreme poverty.  Many families were touched by the fact that their loved ones could never receive the acknowledgement they deserved for the role they played in the First World War.  Some families changed their names so they would not be targeted when their soldiers returned from the front.

I do not wish to sound like the prophet of doom but I believe that at this time next year we will be tackling one of the most serious housing crises this country has ever experienced, including during the 1930s through to the 1960s.  We have just received an assessment of housing need which shows 90,000 families on the housing waiting lists.  Numerous organisations, including Threshold, say the number of people presenting as homeless has doubled, due to their inability to access appropriate housing.

There are two categories of people - figures of international importance, who largely give an address but might engage in some degree of dialogue, and national figures, who are subjected to a more intense grilling.  I have written to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges requesting that it put Pope Francis prominently on this list.  This was unanimously supported by all my colleagues.  I am an Anglican, one of my colleagues is an atheist and the others are Catholics of various degrees of belief.  I ask the Leader to do what he can to advance this possibility and I ask my colleagues to support this in a few words this morning.  I know some of the Members who have already spoken support it, as I have spoken to them about it.<\/p><p>Pope Francis is somebody who might engage in dialogue.  He would certainly say something fascinating and there would be no cliches from him.  It is important at this time to have international figures who give joy and hope.  International political figures have unanimously and entirely let us down.  They never think of values.  This is somebody who is expressing values of economic justice.  He is speaking about decentralising the Vatican, attacking power and of going to Lampedusa and celebrating mass on an upturned boat.  The language of his document, Evangelii Gaudium, is very interesting.  He uses the language of ordinary people.  He speaks as a sinner, as he says, and he speaks with Christ-like humility not just to Roman Catholics but to all baptised Christians and the rest of the world.  His message is one we should seriously heed, whether we are religious or not, because he speaks about justice.  Without justice we will get nowhere.  The language is very different.  Previous popes always spoke with terms such as &quot;the magisterium&quot; and the like, which bespoke the imperial past of Rome and a type of moral authority that came absolutely from the top.  This man speaks to all and has a Christ-like humility.<\/p><p>Would he come?  I think he might.  Nelson Mandela came to the Mansion House which is scarcely a location of any great international renown.  This pope has an unusual background in that he spent several months in Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy in Dublin.<\/p> <p>He knows the country and this city.  He also knows the special role Ireland has played throughout history in the development of Christianity and, in particular, the Roman Catholic Church.  I hope to table a motion early in the new year to the effect that he should be invited to address the House.  I would like all Senators to indicate their support for such a motion today.  In fact, I would like it to become an all-party motion.  I recognise that what I am suggesting could only be done as part of a State visit because he is both a religious leader and a head of state.  He could, of course, enjoy the usual courtesies with the President and the Government but if he spoke in the Seanad, we could open the Distinguished Visitors Gallery to Members of the D&aacute;il.

Pope Francis recently appealed to the Lord to grant us more politicians with integrity and courage in order that we might try to eliminate poverty.  That leads me on to the request I made yesterday that the House should engage in a debate on poverty, particularly in view of the fact that this is a difficult time of year for many people.  In that context, I wish to encourage and support the Samaritans on the work they do.  The Samaritans have left an indelible mark on the hearts of the people.  Indeed, they have helped thousands of Irish citizens.  The care branch of the Samaritans is probably one of the busiest parts of the organisation in the context of the work it does.  It is one of the branches selected to role out the new pan-European Samaritans freephone service.  I wish the Samaritans well in this endeavour and I take this opportunity to congratulate the volunteers in the Clare branch who do wonderful work in providing a 24-7 service.<\/p><p>This will be the final Order of Business of the current session.  It is always important to end on a positive note.  In that context, I wish all of the people who help us and work with is - the staff, the ushers and so on - a very happy Christmas.  We have a great deal to be thankful for as 2013 draws to a close.  Significant progress has occurred during the past 12 months and the Taoiseach has provided the country with very strong and courageous leadership.  He has outlined what we have achieved and his vision for the future in his state of the nation address on Sunday night last.  That address went down exceptionally well.  The Gathering was one of the highlights of 2013 and it led to an increase in the number of tourists who visited Ireland.  What has been achieved is significant.  Many more people came to the country during the The Gathering than was originally envisaged.  I am of the view that what is going to happen in 2014 will be even better.  I would like a significant proportion of the &euro;1.1 billion obtained through the sale of Bord G&aacute;is to be invested in winter and summer tourism projects, such as those involving the provision of greenways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900004#C00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1387449600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.

I refer to the launch yesterday of the Samaritans Impact report.  I am especially conscious of elderly people who have fallen victim to elder abuse.  The House should send out a message to alert people that supports are available.  We heard yesterday from representatives of the Samaritans that the organisation's hotline is extremely busy between the hours of 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. when other support services are closed.  If people are in distress, anxious or need to speak to someone, the Samaritans are available 24 hours per day, 365 days of the year.  It is important that people ask neighbours and local communities to be vigilant on behalf of older people who may be experiencing a difficult time or in distress.  People are often too embarrassed to speak about elder abuse, which can take various forms, from physical and verbal abuse to subtle intimidation.  It is important that support services are available for people experiencing this problem.  In Galway alone, the Samaritans received 33,000 telephone calls in the past 12 months.  The increase in the number of adolescents calling the Samaritans indicates that the problem extends across society.

I am aware from interactions with many Government agencies that most of the problems people are experiencing are the result of cutbacks in services.  I agree with previous speakers that a serious debate is needed on housing.  It is astounding that 90,000 people are on housing waiting lists.  I do not lay the blame entirely at this Government's door as the housing crisis started a long time ago.  A process of privatisation has been under way in the housing sector for some time and the sector has been subjected to serious cutbacks.  Since 2008, for example, &euro;1 billion has been cut from housing budgets.  This is in addition to cuts in basic social welfare and rent supplement payments.  The housing stock is also in rag order as local authorities do not have the funds needed to carry out repairs.  Waiting times for housing are the longest in recent memory.  As such, when Government Senators vote in favour of budgetary cuts they should bear in mind that this is what they are voting for.  Let us not kid ourselves in that regard.<\/p><p>A survey by EUROSTAT, the European statistics agency, has found that only 67% of Irish households had a broadband connection in the second quarter of 2013 compared to a European Union average of 76%.  In response, industry spokespersons noted that when one includes satellite broadband and 3G services, the figures are worse.  Moreover, some 3G and satellite broadband services are barely fast enough to book a flight.  We have a serious problem with broadband, which must be addressed if we are serious about creating jobs, especially in rural areas.  The Government lags behind its European counterparts on this issue.  A debate on broadband in the early new year would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900005#D00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1387450200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I am fully supportive of Senator Norris's proposal that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges invite Pope Francis to the House.

It would be useful if the Leader were to arrange a debate on this matter.  The Referendum Commission has a statutory obligation to publish a report after each referendum and its report on the Seanad referendum contains a number of interesting recommendations.  One of the most interesting findings related to the reasons people voted in the referendum or chose not to vote.  The commission expressed concern that younger people did not turn out in significant numbers and referred to confusion concerning the ballot paper.  It made the interesting point that 13% of those who voted to abolish the Seanad wanted to retain it, while 6% of those who voted to retain it wanted to abolish it.  There was, therefore, considerable confusion surrounding the ballot paper on which universal best practice does not appear to have been applied.  It may be of interest to the Leader to arrange statements on the Referendum Commission's report at some point in the new year.

Documents have recently come into my possession which I am quite happy to discuss and share with the Minister for Health, because they refer to money that was fraudulently taken from the VHI, of which the Minister is the sole shareholder, and from other private health insurers.

The Samaritans is a case in point.  All of its members are volunteers.  They get very minimal support from the HSE and depend totally on voluntary subscriptions and people helping them.  It is a similar case with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and organisations like that.  They are people who are doing an amazing job.  I ask the Irish people not to take it out on those organisations because of what happened in the Central Remedial Clinic and urge them to be generous over the Christmas period in supporting those wonderful organisations that do so much for those who are less fortunate.

The fact that this opinion poll conducted by the commission shows the result we welcome again calls into question the role of opinion polls before the referendum, which showed that on the Monday before the referendum, only 27% of people favoured the retention of this House.  It came in at 52% and now it is even larger.<\/p><p>The Referendum Commission should look at how the opinion polls were conducted because the unfortunate aspect is that the newspapers commissioning the polls then feel obliged to have their political correspondents write articles supporting the polls.

Given that the &quot;No&quot; people were out-spent by about 1,000:1, that spending limit should be examined by the Referendum Commission.

Indeed, the Committee of Public Accounts is debating that matter now.<\/p><p>The amount of money being agreed for all services provided by the Government is &euro;47.5 billion.  As the Bill could be described as a cheque, it is important that it not go undebated.  In future, the Seanad could examine those aspects of spending that do not get the headlines.  I would not criticise the Committee of Public Accounts for much, but one criticism is that it seems to take on those issues that are popular with the media.  In fairness, those issues are usually important and need to be discussed, but other important issues of spending also need to be discussed.<\/p> <p>The Seanad, in terms of its purview and approval of the Appropriation Bill, could discuss in detail what is being spent and identify areas where there is waste, although not as a rival of the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of its powers in this area.

Perhaps the Oireachtas could be alerted by way of an early warning system from the Comptroller and Auditor General of areas in respect of which things are starting to go wrong.  The Committee of Public Accounts has been chaired by many distinguished people in recent years.  I understand it was chaired for some time by Deputy Noonan, the current Minister for Finance.  Deputy John McGuinness is not behind the door in dealing with issues.  While that committee also provides an extremely valuable public service, it might be better if we were not made aware of issues post event.     <\/p><p>Former President Carter attempted to introduce programmed budgeting which included more reviews, appraisals and analyses.  The process lasted for only a couple of years.  The obstacles it encountered were those faced by current bureaucracies, namely, people do not like having their outputs questioned, in particular by politicians.  There was also concern that the additional layer of analysts would add to the budget.  Given most countries now have debt-GDP levels which are unacceptable, we need to ensure value for money.  Traditionally, much of the attention in terms of public finances was on the taxation side, with little attention on asking the fundamental questions we now have to ask, including whether the health service or chunks of it makes anybody any healthier.  There is also a problem in the context of Departments acting as independent republics and preventing the Department of Finance having a say in how they are doing.  Newspapers, rather than report on what a Department is spending money on, frequently report X Minister as being a really good Minister because he gets more money from the Department of Finance for his Department.  Traditional speeches on the opening up a new bridge and so on would be to the effect that a particular Government spent more on bridges than did all other Governments combined.  However, what is never considered is whether the target of that Government in terms of the construction of more bridges and roads than any previous Government was a pointless exercise.  We need to examine our bureaucracy and to scrutinise how allocations are made.  I wonder if the case can be made for a government economic service to address these issues, including whether Departments should be allowed to operate as independent republics, such that when all the Estimates are totalled the Department of Finance is on budget day harassed in terms of increases in taxes or borrowings to finance them.  <\/p><p>The Bill provides for spend of astonishing amounts of money, including &euro;740 million under Vote 32.  On days when there is little legislation before the Seanad, we could have a discussion on particular items related to this spend, at which time we might come up with ideas that would be useful to the Minister of State in the context of his reporting back to the Department of Finance.  The amounts being provided in terms of magnitude are astonishing.  It was once said that to divert attention in capital appraisal from the big items one should include an item on the bicycle shed, which item would be the focus of discussion by everybody while millions of expenditure went through on the nod.  I am sure that is not a model we would want to apply in this Parliament.<\/p><p>In the recent past, we have had, necessarily, to reduce capital expenditure.  It was pointed out by an bord snip nua that because of what happened in the past number of years GDP in 2014 will be approximately 40% less than projected.  Therefore, one should not invest in a capital programme for GDP that will be lower than anticipated.  More importantly, this allows us to put in place criteria, which I believe should be published in advance, in regard to capital investments, including any alternatives.  This will allow us to consider which projects are worthwhile.  We now have an opportunity to put capital investment appraisal on a new footing at breathing space from the actual expenditures.  <\/p><p>I appreciate the short notice at which the Minister of State has come to the House to deal with this important legislation.  In the context of the future role of the Seanad, we could, perhaps, as stated by Senator Byrne, make this a precedent and have discussions here on the large amounts of money provided for in this legislation.  We are happy to assist the Minister in any way we can in ensuring value for money is achieved.  I again thank the Minister of State for coming here at short notice and the Leader for allowing this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900009#H00500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1387452600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House at short notice.

I have been around these Houses for a few years and that is exactly what happened traditionally.  The Bill was passed but remained on the Order Paper of both Houses for a period of time so that people could debate it.  I agree with Senator Walsh and others.  I congratulate the Senators who sought a debate on this matter today.  I was in the D&aacute;il yesterday for all Stages of this Bill and no one turned up.  It is good to debate these issues.<\/p><p>I also agree with Senator Byrne's remark.  While, obviously, the work of the Committee of Public Accounts is of crucial importance, there is a wider remit for both Houses and committees of both Houses to scrutinise vast sums of money that are voted upon by both Houses of the Oireachtas each year.  From the perspective of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, any space that can be found to scrutinise public expenditure is welcome.  We congratulate the Senators on demanding a debate today and ensuring that the Bill, which is a technical Bill, is debated.  In my first five years here, we traditionally had that debate and it would be good to have it in future.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne asked about deferred surrender.  That is the &euro;132.6 million in savings on the capital side.  The carryover into 2013 from last year was &euro;107 million, so it is slightly ahead of last year, but it is broadly neutral because in each given year there will always be an amount to be carried over on capital expenditure.  We do not want a glut of expenditure between October and December simply for the purposes of having the expenditure.  That does not provide good value for money.  So in every year provision is always made to allow capital expenditure on key projects to take place the following year so that we get a spread of expenditure rather than putting pressure on the system to spend money willy-nilly in November or December every year.  That is exactly what we are doing.  The &euro;132.6 million is a small amount in the global sense, but it is an important amount because it demands much greater rigour in terms of those projects that need to be funded by central government funds.<\/p><p>Senators Hayden, Cummins and Barrett spoke on the issue of vigilance.  Some of the reforms we have introduced since coming into office have shone a light on public expenditure that did not exist previously.  The most fundamental change was the separation of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform from the old Department of Finance.  The objective was to have the Departments spending the money allied to the reform of the process.  It has been positive having two separate Departments, one on the financial side and the other on the expenditure side.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, we have introduced multiannual financial frameworks.  Departments now have expenditure profiles over a three or four-year period and must live within those envelopes.  That gives certainty to the Departments and their agencies.  It also gives the Departments some latitude in how that expenditure is to be used.<\/p><p>On the other point Senator Barrett raised, we have now established a cost-benefit unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Every item of public expenditure goes through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Some people might regard it as a bit to Stalinist in its approach.  I am sure some of my ministerial colleagues have a view of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is all-embracing.  However, we now have a very rigorous cost-benefit analysis system.  A cost-benefit analysis signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform forms part of any memorandum a Cabinet Minister will bring to Government.  Part of that is a rigorous economic analysis of the patterns of expenditure.<\/p><p>Traditionally only three Departments had output statements outlining the output for the money they were given.  We are now rolling this out to every Department.  I am not sure if we are there yet, but we are certainly in the process of getting every Department to produce an output statement.  This means that each of the relevant Oireachtas committees can now assess expenditure patterns and ask considerably more questions about the expenditure profiles - a point Senator Byrne mentioned.  It will take some time for committee members to get into the frame of mind to look for output on the expenditure we are proposing.  It will also put more pressure on Ministers to defend why they are spending the amounts being spent on particular schemes.<\/p><p>Those are four reforms we have introduced.  Can we do more?  Of course we can.  We are in a deficit position.  Next year we will spend &euro;53 billion and take in &euro;44 on the tax side.  Therefore it is inevitable that we need to keep a very firm view on public expenditure.  It will take some time before we come into an absolute surplus - although next year we will have a primary surplus when the cost of the national debt is stripped out.  The intention of the Government in the publication of the medium-term economic review we announced earlier this week was to have a budget surplus by 2018.  Given the chasm of public expenditure to tax in recent years, that is an ambitious but valid target for us to attain.<\/p><p>I very much welcome the debate.  I have no difficulty in coming back to the House next year to have a fuller debate on the various subheads Senators might wish to raise.<\/p> <p>I commend Senators on seeking this debate and having at least some public scrutiny of what effectively is a technical Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900010#J01300","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387453800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387453800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Bill reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Appropriation Bill 2013: Motion for Earlier Signature","time":1387453800,"counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900011#K00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1387453800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/>That, pursuant to subsection 2&deg; of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad &Eacute;ireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Appropriation Bill 2013 on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900011#K00600","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387453800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013: Report and Final Stages","time":1387453800,"counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900011#K00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387453800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Bill received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Protection of Children's Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill 2012: Committee Stage","time":1387454100,"counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900012#L00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387454100,"counter":160,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387454100,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387454100,"counter":162,"content":"<p>We know the Minister supports the legislation.

Senator Crown is the expert on health in the House but I will make a few observations from the transport point of view.  Let us examine the penalty points system and the use of mobile telephones.  Mobile telephone usage is the single most important element.  Quite rightly, the authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, view people on mobile telephones as a major transport hazard.  It is a major source of penalty points and fines for those involved due to a fear that people will be distracted from driving.  From the transport point of view, somebody opening a packet of cigarettes, finding matches or a lighter to light them, flicking ashes and discarding the contents, typically out of the window, is much more damaging in traffic terms than encounters with a mobile telephone.  Smoking involves many extra transactions.  We take seriously the use of a mobile telephone in a car because we want to prevent accidents.  As a result, we have reduced the number of fatalities on Irish roads from 650 down to about 160 last year but, unfortunately, there will be more.  The Minister and Senator Crown are the experts on health but I am a transport economist and think there is a strong case for the control of people smoking in cars.  Smoking is more dangerous than using a mobile telephone in a vehicle, of which the Garda, the Minister for Justice and Equality and others take a dim view.  Penalty points have proved successful as a preventative measure in reducing fatalities, especially the deaths of young men under 35 for whom car accidents used to be the major source of ill health and death.  The number has been reduced dramatically.  Is tobacco smoking in cars not a danger in terms of safety and health promotion?  All Senators are keen to have more safety and health promotion.<\/p><p>I will hand over to Senator Crown and will allow him to speak.  The transport aspects of the legislation are very good and I lend them my support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900012#L00900","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1387454100,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman and the Minister.  I apologise to the Minister for my apparent inattention.  I meant no disrespect by my late arrival.  I misunderstood the Order of Business and thought we would debate the health insurance Bill for longer.  I had wanted to make a contribution on that legislation too, but more anon.<\/p><p>As sponsors of the Bill, we have taken the unusual step of bringing forward Committee Stage amendments that reflect two issues.  First, we are cognisant of the public and welcome the support the Minister gave us when we debated the legislation on Second Stage.  It gave us a great boost to our morale, as legislators, that the Government accepted back bench Opposition legislation on merit, a procedure that is somewhat unusual in this Parliament.  I am truly very grateful to the Minister for doing so.  We wanted the opportunity to debate it again with him and that is one of the reasons for advancing amendments at this stage.  Our interaction with the rest of the health service has been less productive in respect of the Bill in the 20-odd months since we first proposed the legislation on First and Second Stages in the House, back in May 2012.<\/p><p>I could go through a turgid recitation of the various meetings that have taken place.  There have been many but I will just bring one to the Minister's attention.  The most recent formal meeting took place a year ago and was with the most senior authorities in the Department of Health.  At that time we were promised we would have what they called the heads of the Bill, which I believe was their way of tabling Committee Stage amendments, by the end of January 2013.  That was almost one year ago and nothing has happened.  Since then it has been indicated that the Minister's very welcome plain packaging Bill has a higher priority.  He will find strong support from me and I suspect across the House for his legislation.  However, there was not a great degree of resources or attention put into passing our legislation.  We believe the Protection of Children's Health from Tobacco Smoke Bill is relatively simple legislation that would give the Minister a quick win in terms of passing a law to advance tobacco control.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned concerns in his Second Stage speech in the House about what he described as serious flaws in the Bill, but we were delighted that he was prepared to advance the legislation to Committee Stage in order that we could avail of the expertise in the various Departments to correct, amend and strengthen the Bill and ensure it was passed.  When we first met after the Second Stage in May 2012 with several of the Minister's colleagues with responsibility for tobacco control, concerns were expressed about constitutional issues, such as whether one could smoke in a private place and things like that, although that concern seems to have been dismissed fairly quickly.  There was a substantial amount of technical comment on issues related to how the Garda would enforce the Bill because, ultimately, it is its members who must enforce the legislation.  Our amendments today address that by incorporating a reference to the Bill in the Road Traffic Act and allowing the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to introduce fixed charges as she or he sees fit in terms of the enforcement of the Bill.  We also needed to go into some detail about fines and how they would be codified, and that is dealt with in our amendments.  There was a question that perhaps the European technical standards directive would be invoked, but the opinion is that it would not.  There was a feeling that the Bill, once passed, could be commenced relatively quickly.<\/p> <p>I am not getting at the Minister about this but I want to give him a brief time line, and I will not name names.<blockquote><br \/>May 3: Publication, introduction.<br \/>May 9: Second Stage.<br \/>May 18: Meeting with senior Department of Health officials.<br \/>May 25: Telephone call with senior Department of Health officials.<br \/>May 29: Meeting with senior Department of Health officials.<br \/>June 2012: Meeting with senior Department of Health officials.  <br \/>E-mails sent on July 16 with proposed amendments not answered.  <br \/>E-mails sent on August 22.

Will update her later that week.  <br \/>July 17: More feedback required from AG.  <br \/>September 17: At this stage we are getting up to a real-time account of it.  <\/blockquote>I believe that with a little action by the Executive the Minister has the status, clout, authority and the interest to make this happen.<br \/>We are proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage we believe address many of the technical concerns the Minister described as constituting serious flaws with the Bill.  Some of us are new to this business but we are prepared to take on board any of the advice the Minister has to offer to strengthen the Bill.<\/p><p> It was the intent when the Bill was proposed that the summer of 2012 would be a time when children, legislatively, would have been protected during the summer holiday period from the consequences of adults smoking in cars with them.  That did not happen.  I then hoped it would happen in time for the summer of 2013; it has not.  Let us please not delay it any further than this.<\/p><p> If I may I will turgidly recite some of the reasons for that because in the aftermath of last night's events, the right wing, pseudo-libertarian, pseudo-free speech lobby are in full thunder crowing and gloating over their victory for free speech and against the nanny state.  I am not a great believer in the nanny state but I will make a few comments on why the nanny state is important in this regard.  It is beyond controversy that there is an increase in the incidence of asthma and bronchitis as a result of second-hand smoke.  It is well understood that there is a unique peril associated with the level of tobacco smoke and its chemical constituent in the small confines of a car.  The data are clear that when one cigarette is smoked the level of particulates is 30 times higher for a child in a car than the level the Environmental Protection Agency would be ringing sirens telling people to get off the streets, go into their houses and close the windows.  It is 30 times higher yet it is still legally possible for a child to be subjected to that.<\/p><p> The exposure after one hour in a car with smokers is the same as that which a fire woman or fireman would experience in four to eight hours of fighting a bush fire.  The emissions are five times higher from a cigarette smoked in the car than from the tail pipe of the car during the period in which smoking one cigarette would take place.  One hour spent in a smoky car produces the same occupational exposure as eight hours in a smoky pub which, thankfully, only a few of us have memories of due to the inspired action of one of the Minister's predecessors, the then Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, action we hope the Minister will emulate with a series of innovative anti-smoking measures.  <\/p><p> The question has arisen as to whether this problem exists.  The advocacy groups, the pseudo-civil libertarians who envelope themselves in the cloak of libertarianism, state that sensible, responsible parents will not do this anyway and therefore the nanny state does not need to legislate.  The evidence is all around us that sadly, parents do it although they do not do it very often.<\/p><p> The real reason for this Bill is its educational value.  It has had an educational value because I personally cannot recall any public debate ever taking place in this country on the scale of the Second Stage debate on the issue of smoking in cars with children.  Suddenly, it was an issue people discussed, and it gives that powerful bully pulpit to children themselves because they hear the arguments and they say, &quot;Mammy, don't be smoking&quot; or &quot;Daddy, don't be smoking&quot;.  <\/p><p> For all these reasons it is critically important that we deal with this small, tight, focused Bill.  We have done the heavy lifting for the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality.  We introduced the amendments.  Can we get a commitment that we will get this Bill passed quickly?  We can then join in a full embrace with the Minister in his other great anti-smoking initiatives we would like to support.<\/p><p> After three years of this Government the score card in terms of anti-smoking legislation - this is not a dig at anybody - is as follows: considered four Bills, rejected one last night, promise of another one - the plain packaging Bill - next year.  We are still turgidly gluing the smoking in cars Bill through a treacly bureaucracy nearly two years later, and the only Bill that has been passed is the one that makes it easier to sell cheap cigarettes to children and other adults.  I know that is not something the Minister wanted; it was enforced on him by inappropriate actions of external agencies from without the State that put him under judicial and commercial pressure to do this but.  Sadly, however, that is the track record.  Let us start by fixing it today.<\/p><p> I am not sure if we will have an opportunity to speak as we go through the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900012#L01000","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387454700,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Yes.

From a Garda implementation point of view, that may be an easier way of doing it.  I put that forward as an idea to consider from the point of view of enforcement.  What Senator Crown has brought forward will protect children but from the point of view of enforcement, an easier way of processing this would be to ban smoking in cars.

My Seanad colleagues have outlined the time-line on this issue but this is a more fundamental criticism of the system that has allowed it to continue for so long.  In other areas where I am dealing with Departments I am told by officials that unless the Minister tells them to do it, it does not happen.  We call ourselves legislators but because the officials will not let things happen, and things do not happen, we are not able or allowed to legislate.  When I spoke to Senator Crown's Bill last night I referred to the piece of paper that is in every Department on why something cannot be done.<\/p> <p>When there are things that should be done for the most obvious reasons, such as those that Senator Crown has outlined, for example, that a child inhaling cigarette fumes in a car is the equivalent of a firefighter working for eight hours in a forest fire, one has to ask why we would not bring in legislation.  Here it is, two years on, yet there are eight more Stages to go.  When it is passed in this House it has to go to the other House.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn introduced the Construction Contracts Bill.  It made sense.  Of course subcontractors should not be left high and dry when the main contractor goes bust.  That is not a criticism of this Government because that started under the previous Government.  It is the system.  This economy and this country have just gone through one of the most fundamental changes in the past five years but the system has not changed.  We know this because it has taken two years to get to the third stage in a ten stage process.  I hope that the Minister will put his weight behind this.  I know that he is working on this issue.<\/p><p>The problem is not the Minister or his concern for this issue.  We have met with officials, garda&iacute;, the Department of Health and civil servants but the Attorney General is like the Wizard of Oz, all-seeing and all-knowing yet we can never find out what the Attorney General is actually doing behind the curtain.  The Attorney General is not the legislator.  She should have a view but every now and then we hear that the Attorney General cannot give an opinion.  When there was a question about recalling the Seanad, however, there was no problem circulating the Attorney General&rsquo;s view on the merits and effect of the recall of the Seanad.  The Attorney General should be able to talk to a legislator and identify a person from her office to liaise with the legislator.  That is how legislation works.  It is not cloak and dagger stuff such that Members of the Opposition or Government  cannot speak to the all-seeing and all-knowing Attorney General.  I do not care who speaks to the Attorney General but she should sit down and engage in the process.<\/p><p>It is because the process has failed that we are here now, with eight more Stages to go.  Will we do it in the lifetime of this Government?  I hope that the Government serves every hour of its five years so that we can say, &quot;Yes we can and we did do it&quot;.  I do not want to see this going into the next Government as Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill did.  It is a failure of the process.  I am not blaming the Minister or the Department.  It is a failure of previous governments that allowed the system to drag its heels for so long that a Bill that so obviously should be ratified and implemented has sat there without moving.  If we were not having this debate it could wait another five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900013#M00400","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387455300,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I strongly support this legislation.  The last it was discussed in the House the Minister expressed several concerns about making it workable.  I understand that Senators have been going back and forth - indeed Senator Crown has catalogued all the correspondence over that period - with a view to trying to reach agreement on this issue.  The amendments before us today present a scheme that is workable.  It is perfectly reasonable to insert provisions whereby there is a presumption that somebody is under age unless they show otherwise as Senator van Turnhout detailed earlier.  The penalties scheme is also workable because it is based on a fixed charge, which we know works .  All we need is leadership on this.  When we discussed other smoking legislation yesterday evening Members on all sides of the House stated that nobody doubts the Minister's bona fides on this broad issue but we need to see measures being taken rather than simply talk about them.<\/p><p>  The Minister has been quoted in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> as saying that he is personally in favour of banning smoking in cars but he thinks that the public needs persuading on the issue.  That is a chicken and egg situation.  There was huge opposition to the workplace smoking ban when it was mooted.  Vintners and other powerful lobby groups ran a big campaign to try to get the Government to back down but it did not because our current party leader, in his then position as Minister for Health, stuck with it and said it was right.  Whether people realise it yet, or not, it is right.  We have seen a huge change in mind-set on smoking in the workplace over the past few years.  Most people now understand that it is completely unacceptable, and it has caused them to think more about smoking in front of other people.<\/p><p>  It is very unfortunate that we have to debate legislation about people smoking in front of children in their cars.  Personally, I think it is disgusting.  It is incredibly unfair, particularly for a small child to be locked in a tiny space.  Senator Crown has already detailed some of the health impacts, but the figures are far worse than a firefighter dealing with a wild fire, or 23 times more toxic than being subjected to passive smoking in a house.  I cannot fathom the idea that anybody would think it is acceptable to smoke in front of their children in such a confined environment but unfortunately it does happen.  It is up to us as the legislature to put in place legislation to protect the most vulnerable people in our society from such health impacts.  It is our job to put in place legislation to protect children from passive smoking.  We know how dangerous it is and what impact it has on their health not just in the short term but the long term too.  We know the rates for respiratory problems and for asthma caused by passive smoking.<\/p><p>  This legislation is very reasonable and deserves the Minister&rsquo;s support.  It works in other countries.  There are several states in Australia, Canada and the United States of America that have bans on smoking in cars where children are present, and in several other countries too.  I urge the Minister to show leadership on this and support and push through this legislation.  If he has problems with the amendments before us, let us hear them and tease them out.  If we have to adjourn Committee Stage today and come back within a set time-frame to have agreement on the final wording of the Bill then so be it.  I ask the Minister please to get behind this legislation and let us all work on a cross-party basis to deal with this issue.  It is one small part of the picture of protecting people from tobacco-related harm in this country but it is important because it protects people who have little choice for themselves, children.  They cannot make that decision.  We have talked about packaging of cigarettes and health warnings and so on, to protect adults from the harm they do to themselves with tobacco.  It is our job to protect children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900014#N00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1387455300,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I too welcome the Minister back to the House.  Every time someone puts forward an idea here we stand up and thank and congratulate that Senator.  I genuinely thank the Senators involved for bringing this forward because although this is a simple Bill it is one of the best I have seen here.  We need to reform the process whereby when the Opposition comes up with a good idea, a good Bill or suggestion, we accept and study it for what it is, rather than turn it down just because it comes from the Opposition.<\/p><p>Thirty years ago, when I was driving my car with my father-in-law and my son, who was four at the time, my son piped up from the back seat to say, &quot;Grandad, please stop smoking in the car.  It is horrible&quot;.  Out of the mouth of babes, as they say.  To this day nobody has ever smoked in our car because I decided he was right.  I had not the courage to say it.  From that day, however, we have had the courage to say that we do not want people smoking in the car or we do not allow it.  Over 30 years ago my son realised that it was not nice to be sitting in a car with smoke in it.  Today he is in the same profession as Senator Crown, albeit at a much lower level.  He is a general practitioner.  He cannot abide smoking.  He thinks that it is one of the worst things a person can do for their health. <\/p><p>This is an excellent Bill.  I urge the Minister not to let it sit but to move on it and pass it.  Sometimes the simplest things are overlooked.  We have made it compulsory to wear seat belts in cars, banned speaking on mobile telephones while driving, and introduced seats for children.  Why can we not bring in this ban?  It is easy enough to police.  If garda&iacute; when they stop us at night can put their heads into the car to check for the smell of alcohol they can certainly smell smoke too.<\/p> <p>Whatever about banning it completely, which may be a good idea, at least adults can say, \"Please do not smoke in my car\", whereas children sitting in the back cannot very well say that.  I ask the Minister to please not leave this parked for too long and to bring forward whatever amendments he must as quickly as possible to get this Bill initiated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900014#N00300","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387455900,"counter":178,"content":"<p>On going through my notes, I came across mention of Fionn O&rsquo;Callaghan from County Wexford, whom the Minister will remember.  He was seven when we started this process and he is now nine, and I hope he will not be an adult when we bring this in.  He took it on himself to write to the Taoiseach, asking him to use his good offices to introduce legislation to enforce a smoking ban where children are present in a car.  His belief in us, as legislators, is something we have to live up to.<\/p><p>The Minister challenged us to raise public awareness.  I have done considerable media work in the past 19 months on this issue, particularly with local media, and I have been asked how many cases we are talking about.  Since we started this process, this has got me looking at cars and, increasingly, I see people smoking in cars with children.  Today in the D&aacute;il and tomorrow in the Seanad, we are going to, appropriately, rush through legislation, the Adoption (Amendment) Bill.  Just 23 families are affected by that legislation, yet we will rush it through in two days.  Therefore, even if we are only talking about a handful in the case of smoking in cars, it is enough.  We are talking about public education.  What has been shown by this process is that where there is a will, there is a way for us to do this.  However, to have taken 19 months is not acceptable.<\/p><p>The Bill is not unprecedented.  Cyprus, for example, has banned smoking in cars with children present, various jurisdictions across North America have done so and many more jurisdictions are in the process of doing so.  Several Canadian provinces, a number of Australian states and other individual jurisdictions have come down on the side of introducing legislation.  This is not a civil liberties or a left versus right issue, rather it is a public health issue that garners public favour.<\/p><p>Children face particular additional risks associated with passive smoking as they breathe more rapidly than adults and, therefore, take more breaths per minute.  As a result, they have a greater level of internal exposure to any environmental toxin in the air they breathe.  Furthermore, owing to their small size and the efficiency with which gas exchange occurs in their lungs, they have a higher level of tissue exposure per molecule of poisonous chemical in the atmosphere than adults.  It is beyond doubt that children who are exposed to second-hand smoke run additional risks, especially in the areas of infection, bronchitis, asthma and, very worryingly, meningitis, which is often a sequel of other respiratory infections.  Sadly, there is conclusive evidence that sudden infant death syndrome is more common in infants who are exposed to second-hand smoke.<\/p><p>The national longitudinal study of children noted in 2009 that approximately 60% of nine year olds in Ireland travel to school by car, with an average journey time of ten minutes each way.  One can imagine the damage done to those children if an adult is smoking.  In addition, the British Medical Association has stated its belief, following an analysis of the data, that the incidence of childhood cancers, by which I mean not only respiratory cancers but those cancers which, sadly, occur in children, including brain tumours and lymphoma, are more common in children who are exposed environmentally to second-hand smoke.  There are also some data to show that children who have early childhood exposure may have a higher risk of developing lung cancer in later life.<\/p><p>Within one minute of a cigarette being lit in an enclosed car, the occupational concentration of dangerous particulates in smoke is, as Senator Crown said, 30 times higher than the level at which the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States advocates that people flee the streets and close the windows in their homes to escape environmental smoke.  The exposure after one hour in a car with smokers is the same as that which a firefighter experiences in four to eight hours of fighting a brush fire.  Tellingly, the emissions are five times higher from a cigarette smoked in the car than from the tail pipe of the car during the period in which the driving is taking place.  One hour spent in a smoky car produces the same occupational exposure as eight hours in a smoky pub.<\/p><p>No one has a right to expose a child to cigarette smoke.  Senator Colm Burke raised the question of a complete ban on smoking in cars, but I believe we may fall foul of constitutional provisions in regard to property rights.  To be fair, we did look at that but we want to stay within the remit of the Constitution.<\/p><p>To deal directly with the Bill, we believe it is a minor amendment but it will extend the list of specified places in the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 to include &ldquo;a mechanically propelled vehicle in which a person under the age of 18 is present&rdquo;.  The Bill also deals with the question of locations to ensure any person who smokes in prescribed places is breaking the law.  As Senator Crown said, we want this as a public education measure.  It is not about acting zealously.  It is not a road safety issue but, rather, a public health issue.<\/p><p>The figures are staggering.  As I said, the Adoption (Amendment) Bill is going through the D&aacute;il in 90 minutes or less today and through the Seanad in 90 minutes or less tomorrow.  In that case, 23 families are praying and waiting, yet in this case, while nobody knows the figure, I can guarantee parents are smoking in more than 23 cars in Ireland.  On that point, parents come to me in support of this because their children get lifts to school from other parents and, while they feel very comfortable saying to other parents, &quot;Have a seat belt on my child&quot;, they do not feel as comfortable, as Senator Moloney noted, about saying it about smoking.  While we might say parents should have the courage to speak out, we all like to keep others happy and conform.  By putting this into law, we will empower parents and children to say: &quot;Do not smoke in this car.  My health is at risk.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900015#O00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1387455900,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to speak on the Bill.  In reply to Senator Barrett, I always get very nervous when anybody calls me an expert on anything.  I assure the House I am not opposing this and I do not intend to submit any amendments to the Bill today, although I will bring amendments at a later stage in the legislative process and I will explain these as I go through the Bill.<\/p><p>I want to put my position on the Bill into context.  Last year, I supported the principle of the Bill but indicated that amendments were required for it to operate effectively.  I went to Government on this matter and the drafting of amendments to the Bill was approved.  Since then, my Department has worked in consultation with the Senators, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Attorney General on progressing the legislation.  The Senators are aware that a number of key legal issues arose during this time.  I am very happy to confirm that some of these issues have been resolved, and I thank the Senators for that.  Other issues, however, are still under examination and subject to ongoing communication between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and fully understand the Senators are frustrated with the perceived lack of progress on the Bill and that the Senators decided to go ahead today in the absence of amendments drafted by the Attorney General's office and submitted to my Department.  My new tobacco policy, Tobacco Free Ireland, includes a commitment to develop and introduce legislation prohibiting smoking in cars where children are present.  I would like to reassure the Senators again that I am interested in results, not ownership of those results, and I am very happy to support the Senators' Bill.  However, I want to make sure it is a Bill that will stick and there are a number of issues that still have to be addressed in it.  I do not want to delay Committee Stage today in any way.<\/p><p>The overall aim of the Bill is the protection of children from the harm caused by second-hand smoke in an enclosed place, and I do not need to repeat what Senators Crown and van Turnhout have told us in regard to the damage that exposure to second-hand smoke causes to children.<\/p> <p>The World Health Organization has stated that there is no safe level of second-hand smoke.  Recent reviews carried out for my Department by the Health Research Board on smoking in cars underscores the extent of the harm caused.  All of the evidence emphasises the importance of protecting children from such exposure.  Children are most exposed to second-hand smoke in the home and thereafter in motor vehicles.  On previous occasions I have drawn the image of a child strapped into a car, with no way of escaping, as the vehicle fills with smoke from the cigarette of the adult who has lit up in the front seat or, even worse, right beside the child in the back seat.  That is what we are talking about here.<\/p><p>Senators should be assured that there is no question of any diminution in my commitment to this matter.  On the contrary, I have remained committed to progressing these measures as quickly as possible in legislation and supporting the Senators in that regard.  I hope we can progress our amendments when outstanding issues have been addressed and that the final Bill will be another in a series of effective legislative controls to protect children from the harm of tobacco products.  I ask Senators to join me in sending a strong message to the tobacco industry that we will not weaken in our resolve to protect citizens and, in particular, our children from their killer product.  Rather, we grow stronger day by day and will not rest until we have achieved our goal of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025 at the latest, if not before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900015#O00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387456500,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I absolutely take the Minister at his word on this matter.

I hope Senators do not take it the wrong way when I point out that the process they have experienced in seeking to progress these particular measures highlights the general difficulties that arise in terms of bringing any Bill through the Oireachtas.  It is why I opted on a range of issues in the Health Service Executive plan, which we are not discussing today, to seek progress through administrative structures, such as the proposed patient safety agency and other reform initiatives.  There is no getting away from the fact that the legislative process is slow.  As Senator Daly pointed out, there is a problem within our system in that it is very difficult to get legislation through in a timely fashion.  Other jurisdictions seem to manage it in a much more efficient way.  There are several factors which contribute to this slow progress, which I will go into in more detail as we move through the amendments.

In 2012, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na apprehended 240,000 motorists, 184,000 of them for speeding, 25,000 for the telephone offences to which I referred earlier and 219 for failing to heed a stop sign.  Garda&iacute; are already tackling motoring offences - the numbers involved would fill three Croke Parks - and we would only be asking them to monitor one additional practice.  It might well turn out that there is very little extra work involved; the successful operation of the ban on smoking in the workplace does not require garda&iacute; to go into pubs and restaurants on a regular basis to see whether anybody is smoking.  The Minister's leadership and advocacy on this issue may very well persuade people to comply without much need for enforcement.  Garda&iacute; are already doing a splendid job in the area of road traffic law enforcement 240,000 times a year; it would not require a huge additional different, when a motorist has been stopped, to look for evidence of smoking where there is a child passenger.  All that is required is the taking on of a single additional duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900016#P00800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1387456500,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Following on from Senator Barrett's point, I see these provisions as being very much cost neutral in the sense that the policing is already taking place.  In fact, if one takes into consideration the numbers of motorists who are stopped and cautioned, we can probably add another 100,000 to the Senator's figure of 240,000.  These proposals are absolutely sensible.  I totally agree that when it comes to this particular issue, we have the wherewithal to set international best practice and be world leaders.  In fact, I would go further and ban smoking in cars outright on the basis that a vehicle might, for example, be shared between adults, one of whom smokes.  In such cases, children could be subjected to residual second-hand smoke on a regular basis, even if neither adult smokes when the children are actually in the car.<\/p><p>The Minister's decision not to oppose these amendments is very positive and demonstrates the goodwill and leadership of the Government on this issue.

There is irrefutable evidence for such a prohibition, as I have indicated.  In fact, I am strongly in favour of banning it in cars altogether not only because of possible scenarios such as that referred to by Senator Conway, but because I see a health and safety issue in terms of driving with a lit cigarette in one's hand.  That cigarette could fall and cause all types of problems, as Senator Norris so colourfully described last night, and there is the distractibility aspect of lighting up and so on.<\/p> <p>There is an argument to be made for that and there is an appetite for it, but this Bill does not address that nor should we expect it to or delay it by adding it in.<\/p><p>Make no mistake, I wish to have this Bill passed as quickly as possible.  Like the Senator, I suffer tremendous frustration when Bills take so long to be passed.  When I was in opposition I introduced a Bill on medical indemnity insurance to ensure that no doctor could be registered unless they were already insured, rather than permit them the temptation of failing to have insurance.  I know some have done that.  That Bill is published but it is sitting on the A list.  That is due to the volume of business we must get through.  There is no malign intent my part or on the part of the Department.  It is due to the structure we have.  Senator Daly is correct.  We must review how legislation is made and passed through the Houses with a view to expediting it, because it is certainly causing problems for me and my Department.  That is the reason I have looked to the administrative process for the HSE service plan to try to expedite some of the reforms which I believe are essential to get our health service to where it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900016#P01000","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387457100,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1387457100,"counter":192,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1387457100,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4 are related and may be discussed together.

I am trying to be helpful because I want this Bill to succeed and to be implemented as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>The intention of the original Bill's provisions and amendment No. 1 relates to the offence of smoking in a car where children are present.  It is intended to give power to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of this offence.  I agree with the comments made by people that the Garda is well positioned to do this and it is not a particularly onerous extra duty for garda&iacute;.  The amendment and the original Bill's provisions on the matter are deemed unacceptable in their current form for two reasons.  First, section 47 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act relates to prohibiting smoking in the workplace.  The provisions relating to this are enforced by the environmental health officers of the HSE.  It is not appropriate in the Department's view, which is supported by legal advice, that the provisions to prohibit smoking in cars, which is mainly a private space although some people have work space cars, should be made in section 47, which specifically relates to the workplace.  The provisions relating to banning smoking in cars where children are present should be contained in a separate provision within the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts.<\/p><p>In addition, as this new provision has An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as enforcer, it is important that there is no legal confusion regarding the roles of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE in respect of tobacco control matters.  Therefore, it requires a separate section of the Act.  This is not an insurmountable problem, but I am simply flagging it for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900017#Q00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1387457100,"counter":196,"content":"<p>It is good to know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900017#Q00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1387457100,"counter":197,"content":"<p>The ban on smoking in the workplace was a sea change.  I commend Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on introducing it.<\/p><p>  Section 47(8) of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, as amended, sets out the definitions of specified places, that is, a place of work, schools and so forth.  These are the specified places where smoking is currently prohibited.  The amendment states that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can bring a prosecution in respect of section 47(8)(<i>j<\/i>), but that is just a definition provision, not a requirement provision.  The Senators have amended a definition provision but have not made an explicit reference to the offence provision, that is, it does not state, in its current form, that smoking in a car with a child present is prohibited.  This is a significant drafting issue but, again, it is not insurmountable.  While I note the Senators have taken on board discussions between health and justice officials regarding inserting powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this amendment cannot be enforced for the reasons already outlined.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 relates to an offence provision under section 5 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act.  The amendment provides for the addition of the provision 6A.

Amendment No. 1 also makes reference to the &quot;Minister for Transport&quot;.  I understand that these provisions have not been examined by that Minister and his Department.  On this basis, the amendment would require further examination.  Without speaking out of turn, my colleague in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is also a doctor and GP and I have no doubt his support and co-operation would be forthcoming.<\/p><p>  I accept the principle of amendment No. 2, which is to make the driver liable for a passenger smoking in the presence of a child.

The Minister for Health was just in the House and I am sure he would never state that huge hospital waiting lists are of no concern to him.  In light of the fact that the administration of services is not up to the standard that citizens would expect, I am of the view that there is a role for local elected representatives to play.  The latter is particularly true in cases where the delivery of services is seen to be deficient.  I would not agree with the fine distinction which states that councils are merely responsible for making policy decisions.<\/p><p>A report published in 1975 indicates that, at that time, the administration of government in this country was more centralised than was the case in communist China.  There is a need to devolve powers from the centre to local areas, particularly those units which can deliver on the most cost-efficient basis.  In general, the latter occurs at the point of service.<\/p> <p>This Bill does not address any of the elements that go to the core of having real local empowerment and democracy.  What we have is local administration with councillors who have a highly restricted and constrained role.  This underpins my thinking on the issue of reform of local government.<\/p><p>Previous attempts to reform local government have been abandoned.  This Bill provides for a directly elected mayor of Dublin.  While Dublin is the capital and largest centre of population, why does Kilkenny, for example, not have an elected mayor who would be the political supremo in the county?  Why do people in County Kilkenny not have a right to decide which person should be accountable to them through the normal democratic process.<\/p><p>Currently, we have all-powerful county managers, some of whom are very good, while others are very poor.  When I was actively involved in the local government scene I did surveys with various organisations which showed that fewer than half of the county managers were regarded as top class performers.  We have seen the manner in which some of them secure their positions.  The Bill does not include measures to address deficiencies in the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission, under which people tend to be appointed on the basis of seniority, who they know or how well they are personally regarded by those in the system.  Radical change is required in that regard.  People outside the local government system must be involved in the appointment process.<\/p><p>These are the principles I would like enshrined in a proper local government reform Bill.

The paragraph reads as follows:<blockquote>If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may, by regulations, do anything which appears to him or her to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing that provision into operation or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid, but no regulations shall be made under this section in relation to any provision of this Act after the expiration of 3 years commencing on the day on which the provision comes into operation.<\/blockquote>This provision gives swingeing powers to the Government.  These types of provisions are emerging as a frequent phenomenon in legislation.  I object to them because they concentrate excessive power in the hands of Ministers.  The first part of the paragraph refers to the removal of difficulties.<\/p> <p>I do not think it is a particularly good idea to remove difficulties.  One does not just bulldoze one's way through them and flatten them out.  The best practice is to examine them, see why they exist, address the situation and cure the difficulty.  There is a little too much of the Denning judgment - the appalling vista - that we must sweep things under the carpet.  This seems to me to give the Minister or any Minister - it is not particular to the current, Minister, Deputy Hogan - a very big sweeping brush for shoving things under the carpet if he or she wishes.  I would prefer the difficulties to be confronted and addressed rather than removed.  The language is sinister, although it is becoming standard.  I want to fight against the fact that this kind of language is becoming standard.  <\/p><p>Turning to the phrase &quot;Also necessary or expedient&quot;, in politics, expediency has an unsavoury ring to it.  Expedient could mean that it is in the interests not particularly of the people but of the parties in government.  That is expedient.  I do not like that word either and it occurs no less than twice.<\/p><p>The paragraph ends by saying that no regulations will be made after three years but by that stage it will be done and dusted so that is no huge concession.  Section 3 states that where regulations are proposed to be made under this section, a draft regulation should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  My first concern is this needs careful management because sometimes these kinds of regulations slither through on the nod.  People have to be watchful or this can happen.  I would be concerned that not enough attention would be paid to the fact that these things, which could have some requirement to be teased out in the House, would go through on the nod.  I hope that will not happen.  The Seanad has been recharged and revitalised by its recent endorsement by the people but at the same time I would be concerned.  <\/p><p>On another point, this is still a very whipped House.  In Senator Hayden and Senator Coghlan, the Government has the Mr. and Ms Whippy of this Chamber, because they are extraordinarily good at it.  There is no suggestion whatever that accidents are likely to happen.  We had a classic example last night when we almost got a Bill to stalemate, at least, but the Whip on the other side was very good - that is their job and they do it.  I hope that the reforms of this House will mean that it resumes its role which has been, for the majority of my tenure here, the situation that it is much less confrontational than the D&aacute;il.  This Chamber should not be a Chamber to be set in confrontation with the D&aacute;il; it should be less whipped.  We should have more expertise in it and we should be prepared to advise rather than confront the Government.  This is all part of my reservation.  To give such very swingeing powers on the grounds of needing to remove any difficulty instead of confronting it, the use of the term, &quot;expediency&quot; and the Whip together, make it clear to me that whatever answer is produced will give such power to the Minister.

Does the Senator not wish the Minister to be able to implement the Bill if an unintended consequence may arise?  In my view, section 3 is very good, for the simple reason that we always complain about documents being laid in the Oireachtas Library without Members seeing sight or light of them.

It has been a relatively standard provision in this type of legislation for almost 100 years.  It is designed as a very seldom-used provision to provide a mechanism for dealing with any unforeseen difficulty that might arise in the short term with the implementation of this type of administrative legislation.  The Local Government Reform Bill will give effect to a number of structures, functions and new means of governance.  It involves significant amendments of the existing local government code.  Much of the change goes back to 1898.  In order to ensure that there is no unintended consequence, this is the type of mechanism we use.  The use of this provision is subject to a number of restrictions.  As Senator Norris pointed out, it requires the positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas - a worthwhile provision; it is time-bound at three years; the making of regulations under this provision would be subject to the most rigorous supervision by the Attorney General.  It is a triple-lock against any Minister who might try to engage in some nefarious practice in the future.  I am satisfied that the provision is necessary to deal with unintended consequences that may arise in the implementation of the legislation but it does not change the spirit of the legislation.  It is merely to implement what is intended in the legislation.  It is in line with practice elsewhere and is limited in its scope to avoid any unintended use.

I accept the Minister's bona fides but I do not like the idea of expediency nor do I like the idea of removing difficulties.  I want to confront difficulties.

I tabled a number of amendments which were ruled out of order but I want to speak to the section.  It concerns the amalgamation of the local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford.  I see all these issues as an issue of balance.  I hope the Minister would agree that strong views were expressed on both sides of the argument regarding the pros and cons of amalgamation and the mergers of local authorities.  While there are undoubtedly advantages and positives in mergers and amalgamations, there are also fears, risks and challenges which those local authorities will face.  People must make up their own minds and I know there are different opinions in Waterford.  I cannot speak to the same extent for Limerick and Tipperary but the Minister will know there were very strong opinions expressed by some in Waterford, even within local government, that the merger of the two local authorities would not be good in the long term for the county and city, particularly the city.  I took a decision that I was against the merger but only on balance because I share some of the concerns.  I see some of the positives.  While I will make the arguments against it, I assume the Minister will press ahead with his plans.  When he does, we need to ensure the merged authority works in the best interests of the people of Waterford city and county, which is what we will all do.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that what we are seeing are wholesale cuts to layers of local government in respect of abolishing town councils and merging some authorities.  Waterford city, as the Minister knows, is the country's oldest city.  It is 1,100 years old next year.  It is an historic city and it is only right and proper that a city of its size would have its own local authority and autonomy.  We are not going to see Galway, Cork or Dublin lose their city councils and their autonomy.  If we look at what has happened with job creation across the State and in the regions over the past five years in particular, we see there is a concentration of jobs in the larger urban centres of Cork, Dublin and Galway.  We have not seen that in the regions.  I can give the Minister the figures in terms of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland breakdown.  The region I share with the Minister - the south east - has the highest level of unemployment in the country and is well above the national average of 14%.  There is a very real concern that not having autonomy and the ability to expand, grow and develop with its own structures and autonomy distinct from the county could hamper economic development in the future.<\/p><p>The Minister spoke about shared services.  The logic behind his argument is that the mergers and amalgamation will save money.  He talks a lot about the savings that can be made but the reality is that some of those savings could have been made through greater collaboration between the two local authorities without having to merge them in the first place.  That would make sense to me.  I see the sense in people who live in Passage East, Cheekpoint or Dunmore paying their motor tax or bills in the city rather than having to go to Dungarvan in County Waterford.  Some of that makes sense but it could have been done through shared services.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for the holding of a plebiscite in Dublin on the issue of a directly elected mayor, yet the Minister is, in essence, going to disband two local authorities and force them to amalgamate without asking for the consent of the people who live in those areas.  I think this was a wrong move on his part.  It is a mistake to change fundamentally the structures of local government in a city as historic and large as Waterford without asking the people for their consent.  This is why I tabled an amendment in this regard.<\/p><p>The Minister might also give me his view on the expansion of Waterford city.  If the city is to expand, it needs to expand northwards and we have the issue of the boundary extension of Waterford city into parts of south Kilkenny, which would be beneficial to all the people who live in that part of Waterford and Kilkenny.  I know that might be a hot political issue but if the Minister is genuinely interested in the development of the south east, he must agree that Waterford city needs to be the economic driver.  It needs to be the hub, capital, key economic driver, engine and heart of the region.  For that to happen, it needs to have its own autonomy and to be able to expand naturally outwards without restrictions relating to boundaries and local government.  That is why I agree with Fine Gael and Labour's position before they entered Government when they supported the extension of the boundary into parts of south Kilkenny and looking at shared services between the local authorities as a better fix than forcing the amalgamation of the local authorities.<\/p><p>I want to come back to the issue of costs.  I am sticking to Waterford.  The Minister makes many positive arguments relating to the merger of the local authorities, which I accept.  I have said it is an issue of balance but one of the core arguments the Minister makes concerns costs.  He outlines the savings but he does not give us the corresponding figures for how much it will cost to amalgamate the local authorities.  Despite requests for those costs from many people in Waterford, we have not been given the figures.  Like many other things this Minister is doing in respect of water services, he is asking us to take a leap of faith without giving us the real information.<\/p><p>I have made my point on the amalgamation.  I believe it should be a matter for the people who should have had their say.  If the people of Waterford city and county believe merging the two local authorities is a good thing, and we had the arguments for and against, that is the way we should have proceeded.  If the Minister proceeds with the amalgamations, we all must work as best we can to ensure we do the very best for Waterford city and county and get the development we need.  I hope the Minister will accept that what has happened economically in the south east and in Waterford presents problems and challenges.  We have a big problem with unemployment, which is 20% in Waterford city.  Those challenges must be met.  Whatever our views on the amalgamation, local government structures must be fit for purpose to meet the challenge facing the people living in those areas.  I hope the Minister will take on board the comments I have made in a constructive way and see them as constructive.  I look forward to his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900021#U00800","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1387459500,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I support what has been said by Senator Cullinane.  Looking at the shape of the local government system subsequent to this Bill, we will have regional city centres in many of the other regions, for example, Cork, Galway and Dublin.  All economic indicators show the south east lagging behind the other regions.  Unemployment is consistently high across the region.  There is a need for greater attention from State agencies, particularly the IDA, which has neglected the south east, in particular some of its counties, including my own.  We have had only a small number of visits from overseas companies in recent years - no more than one per year over the past four or five years.  In some years, we have had none.  In respect of the removal of Waterford as an administrative centre in its own right, it is the largest city in the region and, as such, could be a focal point which would benefit the region economically and from a developmental point of view.<\/p> <p>I do not understand the reason for absorbing it into a county structure, no more than I can understand why Kilkenny would be absorbed.  We will deal with this when we comes the dissolution of town councils.  Will the Minister give the rationale for this?  I see it as being fundamentally disadvantageous to the region.  There are often tends to be rivalry between various towns and counties in the region.  The administrative elected body of the capital of the region, namely Waterford City Council, has traditions and heritage, is involved in development, and promotes itself and in doing so indirectly promotes the region.  If we do not have regional focus and Waterford City Council is removed there will be a loss in the area.<\/p><p>Even though the amendments have been ruled out of order I wonder whether the Minister would be minded to re-examine this matter and include it.  There may well be a similar argument for Limerick but I am not sure.  I do not have a major difficulty with North Riding and South Riding in Tipperary being amalgamated as it may make a certain amount of sense.  The idea behind having a plebiscite in the areas to make the decision is something I will discuss with regard to town councils.  This is a good principle and was enshrined in local government in the 2001 Act, if I remember correctly.  The councils themselves can initiate a referendum where the people wish to make a particular decision on an issue of importance to them.<\/p><p>I certainly support the sentiments expressed and I genuinely feel the Bill is going in the wrong direction in this regard.  Some Senators have spoken about areas losing seats.  Wexford has gained 13 extra local authority seats.  It is not something for which anybody on any of the councils on which I served in Wexford would wish.  Every time a review of local government took place during the 25 years I was a member of the council it made a unanimous submission stating that membership of the council should not increased.  This was because there is an appropriate size of membership which facilitates constructive interaction, debate and decision making.  Once it goes beyond a certain number it becomes a talking forum rather than a focused decision-making body which holds the administration to account.  This is a concern not only of mine but of many people who have taken an interest in local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900021#U00900","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387460100,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I was mayor of Waterford city in 1995 and 1996 and when I hear it spoken about I certainly must speak about it also.  Waterford city is the hub and gateway city in the south-east and drives the region.  I agree that for this role to be fulfilled greater support for the region is necessary from the Government, particularly with regard to job creation.  The region and city have been hit more than most.  In saying this, I must also point out that since the Government came to office 3,000 extra people have been employed in the south-east, which is something that should not be forgotten.  I am the first to stand up and shout, and will continue to do so, that Waterford city and the region should get its fair share of job creation and employment.<\/p><p>I want assurance from the Minister - which I have received previously, but I would like to have it on the record of the House - with regard to the mayoralty of Waterford city.  I want assurance from the Minister that the mayor will retain all the historic offices and ceremonial duties which have been held for 1,100 years.  In 2014 Waterford city will celebrate its 1,100th anniversary.  It is the oldest city in the country.  I certainly would not support anything, irrespective of what party it came from, if I felt it was not of benefit to the city and was detrimental to the growth of the city.  Naturally we would all like to see everything stay as it is, but things move on.  Given the increased population in the metropolitan district of more than 65,000, I see the amalgamation as being of benefit to Waterford city and county.  It will give us a greater critical mass to put in place the structures necessary for any gateway city to operate.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister on financing a number of projects through local government in Waterford in recent months.  We had been waiting ten or 15 years for a new fire station and it is now under construction.  When the old fire station is knocked down we will have an extension of six new courtrooms in the courthouse, also funded by the Government.  I understand that tomorrow more significant funding will be announced with regard to housing.  The Minister is certainly playing his part in the region and I can testify to this.<\/p><p>The big driving factor for the region, which all bodies and counties in the region realise will be highly significant and will help the region, is the university.  Its development is in the programme for Government and Carlow and Waterford Institutes of Technology will be amalgamated to obtain university status.  When this happens - it is not a question of if but when, and I hope it will be sooner rather than later - it will drive Waterford city and county and help us develop the new local authority structure to be put in place.  It will unite the city and county.<\/p><p>Many people would like to see the city council remain because of the ceremonial duties in particular, but I will wait for the Minister's response on this.

I understand this is a very important issue for the structures of local government, but there is no such thing as business as usual for Waterford city.  The economic situation in Waterford city has not been good for some time, particularly in the centre of the city.  Waterford County Council developed commercial facilities close to the boundary of Waterford city which, unfortunately from a planning point of view, were allowed.  Many of the businesses in the centre of Waterford city went into decline.  This is the type of irresponsible planning which has happened in Waterford and which was replicated in several other places.  The rows at local level about boundary extensions pale into insignificance when one sees what neighbouring authorities in the same county have done to each other.<\/p> <p>I am surprised that Senator Cullinane is concerned about reducing the number of local authorities when his own party in Northern Ireland has proposed a reduction from 28 councils to seven.

These will be used for essential services, including implementing the people's business.  There will be a one-off establishment cost for any merger.  The same position will apply in Limerick.

I opened and provided the necessary finance for the library facility, which the Senator never sought.  I do not believe that anyone else sought it either, but we provided an essential service for the people of south Kilkenny in Ferrybank.  Senator Walsh must put up with the fact that most of his businesses are in the jurisdiction of the planning authority of Kilkenny County Council rather than New Ross, but it is a thriving business because it is in the area with the lowest commercial rates in the country.  He would not move out of Kilkenny unless it was of significant advantage to his business, even though he loves New Ross.<\/p><p>This is the way business is.  People are not sentimental about where they go in business.  They go somewhere because of the bottom line.  Businesses must survive.

They are perfectly entitled to do so and there are valid arguments in favour of it, but we should have had the debate on amalgamation of the local authorities and let the people decide if it was the right thing to do.

I agree with him that this is an important Bill.  However, the changes being made in this Bill are not reform but a dismantling of local government.  While some people believe it will have a positive impact on local government, I believe that impact will be negative, particularly in my region in that it will no longer have a focal point.  I agree with Senator Cullinane that every region, in terms of economic, cultural and administrative progress, needs a capital and a focal point.  As I said yesterday, Waterford is a prime example of a council that takes pride and a genuine interest in its city.  I have met people prior to their going abroad to promote the interests of Waterford city, which was indirectly of assistance to the region.  This focus will now be part of a wider agenda for the county as a whole.  The alignment of the interests of the city and county do not always coincide.  We are losing something, therefore, in terms of what is being done.<\/p><p>The Minister was generous to point out the progress made by former Minister, Martin Cullen, with support from the then Government and in respect of which there was a great deal of lobbying by Kilkenny County Council in ensuring construction of the motorway went ahead.  It not only benefits Waterford but Kilkenny and Carlow.  It undoubtedly was the foundation stone upon which economic growth in the region began.  Five years into this recession, approximately &euro;50 billion has been allocated in next year's budget for current expenditure.  Nothing has really changed since the current crisis began.  In the past, the allocation for current expenditure was somewhere between &euro;50 billion and &euro;60 billion.  It has been clipped a little since while capital expenditure has been cut by &euro;3.3 billion, which is significantly more than half in the same period.  I have made this criticism previously.  The Minister's comment in regard to former Minister, Martin Cullen, raises the question of what the Ministers, Deputy Hogan, and Deputy Howlin, will have to show for their tenure in government with regard to the south east.

Since this Government took office, there has been a decline in the ranking of our universities in the international league tables.  This has to be of concern to us all.  My recollection is that the only university in the top 100 is Trinity College Dublin and it, too, has slipped down the ranks during the past seven years.  There is no point in having a university in Waterford unless it is not properly resourced.  The Minister referred to the library in Ferrybank for the people of south Kilkenny.

It saddens me to see the centre of the city run down in the way that it has been.  Major outlets moved out for business reasons, as the Minister correctly said.  That was facilitated by politicians who decided to rezone lands on the fringes of the city, causing the demise of the centre.

How does the Minister envisage this working in practice?  Will there be an equality or parity of esteem between the city and the county?  Legislatively, they are referred to as city and county.  Presumably, the councillors who will form the bulk of the municipal area will elect a mayor, although perhaps the Minister will clarify this.<\/p> <p> I presume that those who represent the city borough or electoral area will elect a mayor.

How does he see that relationship work?  Does he think it will be an advantage?

The area involved is huge.  It has often been said that Connemara is larger than counties such as Leitrim, Roscommon and Louth in terms of population or geographical area.  Was that taken into consideration?  As the Minister said, the distance from Clifden to Portumna is absolutely massive.  It is very hard for the members of Galway County Council to cover such a distance.  The city councillors have the advantage of having their remit confined to the area within the environs of the city.  It is a genuine issue.  We feel that the way Galway County Council is structured means there is a bias towards the east of the county.  There is a bias in favour of east Galway when decisions are being made because most of the councillors - 23 of them at present - come from east Galway.  The best example I can give in that regard relates to the fire brigade service, which is the subject of much debate at present.  As the Minister will be aware, there are seven or eight fire stations in the east of the county, but the station in Clifden is the only one in the west of the county.  A strong case has been made to the effect that the traditional structure of the county council is part of the reason for that.  There has tended to be a bias towards the east side of the county in the allocation of resources.  I know the Minister has looked at all of the options.

Why was that not considered as part of the new boundary changes?  Would it not be in the best interests of the people who live in some of those areas if they were to come under the new metropolitan district of Waterford?  Notwithstanding one's allegiance to one's county colours, I think it would have been a positive move and an act of good faith on the part of the Minister in relation to Waterford city.

Therefore, we were proposing that County Waterford as a whole should have 36 councillors, as opposed to the 32 councillors currently provided for.

To be helpful and constructive, we suggested a more appropriate figure in the case of each of the cities and counties.  We are not criticising and opposing the Minister for the sake of it.  We are trying to ensure there is adequate elected representation across the board.  We want to make sure the issue of subsidiarity is taken on board.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is difficult to put one's name forward on a ballot paper seeking to be elected to represent one's city or county on a local authority.  It is a demanding job.  More demands than ever are now being made of local authority members.  It is important that we have a sufficient number of local authority members across the State.  If one examines any of the reports that compare the local government figures in this State to the equivalent figures in other states, including the OECD reports, one will find that we have the lowest number of councillors of any of the European countries.  That problem will be exacerbated by the passing of this section of the Bill, which will see a significant reduction in the number of councillors.<\/p><p>That is one of the fundamental reasons I oppose the Minister's entire approach.  He is reducing the number of councillors, but he is not giving local authorities any powers of substance.  He is tinkering at the edges.  He is making some minor changes here and there.  He is providing for no new fundamental powers.  This Bill does not devolve power from any Department to local government.  It is not in the Bill because the Minister is not interested in it.  He is interested in introducing minimalist piecemeal reform, saving money and reducing the number of councils and councillors.  It is all about reducing numbers.  It is not about reform at all.  A big opportunity is being missed.  The Minister had a big opportunity to reform local government properly, but he has not done so.  I will oppose this section on the basis that I do not accept the figures proposed by the Minister as he tries to reduce the number of councillors.

Having gone through the Bill, the only changes I see are name changes.  This is a superficial approach to improving local government.  As I mentioned earlier, the number of county councillors in my own area will increase from 21 to 34.  I suggest there is an optimum number of councillors that makes a council effective.  For that reason, the numbers set out in this Bill for the vast majority of councils are probably too large.  As a consequence, the effectiveness of local government will be nullified.  There are other reasons for that.  The approach we are taking is disparate and centralised.  Senator Cullinane is absolutely correct when he compares the position here with that in other countries.<\/p> <p>The Irish system of local government is probably the most centralised in the OECD.  It is controlled from the centre, which is probably the reason it lacks cost-effectiveness, efficiency and accountability.<\/p><p> I fully concur with the Minister on out-of-town shopping centres and developments.  While he is correct in that regard, the responsibility for this trend lies not with local authority members but officials who were probably working to guidelines issued by the Department.  We must recognise where the deficiencies and failures in the system lie.  Given his long involvement in local government, I am surprised at the Minister's approach.  He has worked with some good county managers in County Kilkenny and will have observed the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of local government.  For this reason, I expected him to show greater empathy in terms of what needs to be done.  Unfortunately, what we see here and in all changes to local government and many other areas is the retention of as much power as possible by the centre, in particular the bureaucracy.  This is regrettable because the Bill presented an opportunity to build on the work done in 2001, which did not deliver the anticipated outcome and has threatened the democratic functions and empowerment of local authorities.  Once the principle of subsidiarity has been abrogated, as has been done in a dramatic fashion in this Bill, it is difficult to put in place an effective system.<\/p><p> I recall discussion on proposals to abolish town councils and replace them with area or district councils and abolish county councils and have area councils report to regional councils or authorities.  The Bill appears to move by stealth in that direction.  If that is the route being taken, let us have a debate on it but we should be informed.  Have discussions taken place in that regard?  Is this Bill a step towards local government becoming regional, with district areas reporting to a regional authority?

They thought that as the Government was involved in granting the licence to the training college it should take some responsibility to establish if there is any way to work this through to the satisfaction of the students and their parents.

The situation that arose with regard to the Pilot Training College, PTC, Waterford, in July 2012 was most regrettable and came about from the failure of PTC, a privately-owned and operated flight training school, that reneged on its contractual obligations to its client students in respect of the completion of their training in Florida.  I met with some of the representatives of the students on 20 July 2012 and I fully appreciate the frustration felt by the students involved and their families, and I sympathise with their plight.  Unfortunately, in the current economic climate, many businesses have failed, leaving their suppliers, etc., out of pocket, including businesses where a State body has a regulatory role.<\/p><p>It is important, however, that the role of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, with regard to the oversight of pilot training colleges is properly understood.  The IAA appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on 24 October 2012 to discuss the issue of PTC among other topics and the committee received a very full account from the IAA of its role and the actions it had taken in so far as its statutory responsibilities were concerned.  The IAA has responsibility for approving and overseeing flight training organisations in Ireland.  The authority's primary functions in this regard are the oversight of the safety, quality and standard of the training being delivered, the conduct of examinations and flight tests.  It considers whether the company has sufficient resources to safely provide the training required to the internationally determined standards.  It has no involvement in, or responsibility for, the contractual arrangements between PTC and its students or for overseeing the financial viability of the company.  The IAA's role in the approval and oversight of flight training organisations is based on European rules.  Unfortunately, PTC is not an isolated example.  There have been examples of failures of similar organisations in other countries in the past decade as well, for example, in the United Kingdom where the UK Civil Aviation Authority approves the operation of flight training organisations, a number of flying schools ceased operations with students suffering losses.<\/p><p>The question has been raised as to whether such companies should be bonded.  This is not common practice in other jurisdictions and to introduce such a scheme in Ireland would be likely to result in schools leaving this jurisdiction to set up elsewhere where there are no bonding requirements.  That is, however, still under consideration.  When it appeared before the committee in October, 2012, the IAA outlined the very significant steps it had taken in an attempt to help the students involved.<\/p><p>When the IAA was notified on 26 June 2012 that the Florida Institute of Technology was ceasing all training activities due to non-payment for services delivered, including room and board and that the matter had been referred to the institute&rsquo;s attorneys, the IAA immediately sent a representative to Florida to liaise with the students and offer assistance where possible.  The IAA secured the training records of all the students and all flight and ground training carried out in California up to then was credited towards the students&rsquo; final qualifications where possible.  The IAA also worked successfully with other flight training centres to explore how the students involved might complete their training elsewhere at as reasonable a cost as possible.  Furthermore, with my agreement, the IAA funded the flight costs of those self-financing students in Florida who had an existing contract with PTC and who wished to leave the United States of America.  The offer was made as a gesture of goodwill and without prejudice.  I understand that some 65 students availed of this flight home at the time.<\/p><p>The IAA completed several audits on PTC in 2011 and 2012.  During these various inspections it was clear that PTC complied with all EU and international requirements as a flight training organisation.  There was no indication of any deficiencies.  Those EU and international requirements state clearly that the financial evaluation carried out as part of the approval and oversight process is not intended to be a consumer protection provision.  It focuses purely on safety resources requirements that staff are suitably qualified and the proper internationally determined standards of training are being delivered.  PTC&rsquo;s accounts were signed off on 29 August 2011 by professional auditors and were not qualified in any way.  The accountants were satisfied that the group, including PTC would continue as a going concern.<\/p><p>Regrettably, as I said to the representative group on 20 July neither the Government nor the IAA will be able to compensate them for moneys lost and we have no liability in this regard.   While we have great sympathy for the students and their families, it was not possible to isolate them from other PTC creditors, foreign or Irish, nor to offer compensation funded by taxpayers to such a group.  In July 2012, the High Court appointed an examiner to handle the affairs of PTC.  The IAA worked with the examiner in assessing the options available but on 28 September 2012 the examiner advised the High Court that the final potential investor had withdrawn and the court authorised the liquidation of PTC. <\/p> <p>The examiner advised the High Court that the final potential investor had withdrawn and the court authorised the liquidation of PTC.  The IAA revoked the approval of PTC Florida on 20 August 2012 and the approval of PTC Waterford when the company was being wound up.  I understand that the liquidation of PTC is ongoing in accordance with company law.  Any alleged breach of company law is a matter for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900030#EE00300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387464900,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

If an arm of the State is licensing any educational body or a private company in particular, the Department should make careful inquiries.  I do not mean to infer that this body was set up as a money-collecting machine but it can happen where money is collected from students and then the company is liquidated after two years, leaving students stranded.  There will need to be safeguards.  I believe this company was taking bookings from students in the knowledge that the company was not viable.

Shops, restaurants, hotels, are all licensed by the State and people are not compensated when these go out of business, nor do they seek compensation.  What is different in this case is the amount of money.  Even if the IAA determined at a certain point that PTC was financially unsound, all it could have done would be to shut it down.  The students would still have lost their money.  In my view the only solution in the long term is either an insurance or a bonding scheme or what is now much more the practice whereby people pay fees monthly or quarterly.

The allegations of unsavoury practices engaged in by some servants and-or agents of the agency is most worrying to the taxpayers of Ireland.  Last May and June I raised issues pertaining to NAMA and employment contracts and the need for non-compete clauses to be included in them.  I also raised the fact there was evidence of data protection breaches, contrary to the Act, and indeed the possibility of employees having breached section 221 of the Act which forbids lobbying by third parties.  These are all very serious matters.<\/p><p>  However, this matter arose during the course of this week with complaints to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a court action and now a former employee turned whistleblower coming forward to disclose wrongdoing in the agency.  I understand the matter is now with the Garda fraud squad.  I look forward to learning the outcome of these investigations in the near future.<\/p><p>  In early summer this year I warned that these communications could leave the State and the taxpayer exposed to a potential claim for damages of millions of euro in circumstances where it is quite clear to me that NAMA, its servants and-or agents did not act in the best interest of its customers and indirectly, the taxpayer.  That NAMA has been leaking confidential information is clearly placing the interests of personal gain ahead of the best interests of the taxpayer.  It is clear to me that much of what appears to have been happening was facilitated by the veil of secrecy surrounding the agency's operations.  The previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government created NAMA, at a cost of billions of euro to the Irish taxpayer, yet there is no transparency or accountability required from the agency.  This is baffling in a modern democracy.  We are in a legislative headlock because the legislation governing the agency, the NAMA Act, is severely limited in scope. This has helped to create these recent problems and revelations which are contrary to the public interest.<\/p><p>  We do not know what deals are being done nor do we know the identity of those buying property from the agency.  It is not right to put private sector assets into a body which could be subject to influence because of the lack of accountability.<\/p><p>  In the past I have referred in this House to an individual who left NAMA and immediately became partner of another property company in the UK, all made possible because there is no non-compete clause of significant duration existing in employee contracts.  No regard is being given to the sensitive information relating to valuations, loan amounts and to the amount NAMA would be willing to accept for properties.  This is information which was known to this individual.  At a time when property prices are on the rise - Dublin property prices have risen by 16% - this issue is of great concern.  Today's whistleblower admitted that he has had communication with third parties, along with other employees of NAMA, in respect of a customer's loans.  This was and is highly prejudicial to the NAMA customer in question and will undoubtedly lead to copious legal cases being taken against the agency.<\/p><p>  Suspect behaviour seems to be tolerated in NAMA.  An Internet search showed that in August 2012 the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>reported how an existing employee made himself a preferential creditor in dubious circumstances while working with Irish Nationwide, a bank which is now within the remit and ownership of NAMA.  He was an employee of the debtor's sister company before taking up employment with Irish Nationwide.  I ask if NAMA investigated Peter Malbasha at this time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900031#FF00500","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1387464900,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins, you are out of order for mentioning individuals by name under the privilege of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900031#FF00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1387464900,"counter":432,"content":"<p>This man nearly earns the same salary as the Taoiseach and yet there is no oversight when it comes to his activities.

We cannot allow unsavoury practices to continue and we must strive for better standards.  For that reason I request the Minister to liaise with the Minister for Justice and Equality to consider tabling amendments to the NAMA Act to allow for accountability, otherwise we will have learned nothing from recent events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900031#FF01100","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1387464900,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I will make an important preliminary point.  This Adjournment matter refers to revelations.  A number of allegations have been made and these are currently the subject of two Garda investigations.  It cannot be said yet whether there will be revelations.  I wish to assure the Senator that the NAMA board and I are taking these matters very seriously.  The chairman, Frank Daly, has informed me that the NAMA board met this morning on the allegations.  It indicated to the Committee of Public Accounts that it is anxious to be afforded a public opportunity to address these claims.<\/p><p>The PAC has now extended an invitation and the chairman and chief executive of NAMA will attend a meeting of the committee at 11 a.m. tomorrow morning.  Indeed, NAMA issued a statement earlier today welcoming the opportunity afforded to it by the PAC to address allegations made against the agency in recent days, stating that it considers the PAC to be the most appropriate forum to address these matters.<\/p><p>As has been highlighted in recent days if any individual has information which suggests that wrongdoing has occurred, I would expect that he or she would bring such information to the immediate attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as legally obliged under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  It is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate any wrongdoing.<\/p><p>I am informed that NAMA has referred two complaints about former employees of the agency to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, pursuant to section 202 of the NAMA Act, which deals with unauthorised disclosure of information.  Contrary to some reports, the second referral occurred in the first quarter of this year and not in recent days.  Given that these matters are currently under active investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I cannot make any further comment on the specific details of these cases.<\/p><p>I am also informed that NAMA has not been provided with any detail relating to recent statements made in the Seanad about alleged impropriety by NAMA staff.  It may be that these recent statements refer to a case that has already been referred by NAMA to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but NAMA does not have enough information to confirm this.<\/p> <p> With regard to the level of political and administrative oversight, NAMA is subject to a high level of public accountability compared with other commercial semi-State bodies.  This is reflective of its function in managing a significant financial exposure on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  The National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 makes the agency accountable in a number of ways, including by laying its annual report and audited financial statements before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The chairman and chief executive officer are accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees and give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so.  In addition to its annual accounts, NAMA is required to submit to me an annual statement setting out its proposed objectives for the following year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies, and its proposed use of resources.  The agency is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information on its loans, financing arrangements and income and expenditure.  I, in turn, am obliged to lay all such reports before the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> I am advised that NAMA's accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has a permanent team of officers based in the agency with unrestricted access to all its records and files.  In addition to conducting annual financial audits of NAMA's accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has produced special reports regarding NAMA's acquisition of bank assets and management of loans.  The process of loan valuation and acquisition is also being audited by the European Commission.  An overarching review of NAMA is subject to a special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which will be published early in 2014.  As provided under the Act, I may also request <i>ad hoc<\/i>reports in such form as I require.<\/p><p> It is clear, therefore, that NAMA is subject to a very high level of accountability, both in the legislation and in practice.  I confirm that the oversight arrangements are continually kept under review to ensure the agency acts in the best interests of the taxpayer.  I will fully consider the outcome of the Garda investigations and the views of the Committee of Public Accounts in seeking to protect the taxpayer.  The outcomes of these matters, as well as the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, will be considered in the NAMA review my Department is undertaking next year, as required under the 2009 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013121900031#FF01200","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1387465500,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

In respect of any dealings with the individual I named in the course of my submission today, I ask that NAMA be mindful of subsections 43(2) and 43(3)(<i>d<\/i>) of the Act.  I will give the Minister a copy of the newspaper report on this issue immediately following this debate.  I welcome his undertaking to consider the outcome of the Garda investigation and the views of the Committee of Public Accounts.
