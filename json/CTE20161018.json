To date, we have met the Comptroller and Attorney General to discuss his report; representatives of NAMA; the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan; and Mr. Brian Rowntree, a former member of NAMA's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, NIAC.  Today we have an opportunity to meet three of the board members of NAMA.<\/p><p>They are current board members who were also on the board at the time of the sale of Project Eagle.  We will meet three former members of the board on 17 November 2016.  The reason for doing so is that there was a suggestion, before the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was made, that members of the board of NAMA had requested to meet the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That meeting did not happen, which we saw in the report, so we said we would facilitate the meeting.  That is no criticism of the Comptroller and Auditor General as it is just our prerogative to do so.  <\/p><p> I welcome Mr. Brian McEnery who was also and remains chair of NAMA's audit committee and a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC, at that time.  We are joined by Mr. Oliver Ellingham who was also and is chair of NAMA's risk management committee and a member of the audit committee.  Also in attendance is Mr. Willie Soffe who was chair of the planning advisory committee and also a member of the NIAC at that time.<\/p><p> Please note that we are joined from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General by Mr. Andy Harkness, secretary and director of audit, and Mr. John Riordan, deputy director.<\/p><p> I want to acknowledge that since our meeting with Mr. Rowntree we have received correspondence from NAMA, dated 14 October, from NAMA's head of public affairs.  He enclosed a copy of the Ulster University's spatial analysis of the residential development landbanks in Northern Ireland that was compiled for NAMA.  He also enclosed another document called Opportunities for Open Discussion by Ulster University and a copy of a parliamentary question from and reply to Deputy Pearse Doherty on the matters we spoke about with Mr. Rowntree.  The letter from NAMA categorically refutes what Mr. Rowntree said in a number of aspects.  We will publish that correspondence this morning.  We will not have a debate on it but I wish to acknowledge that we have received the correspondence and I have put it out there publicly, as urgently as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016101800002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476781200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>To follow up on the matter, it would be valuable to write back to NAMA to say a number of presentations were given prior to the 2014 presentation that it cites that NAMA failed to mention in its letter.

The committee has asked us to focus on four main aspects of the sale: the financial outcome; the basis for the decision to sell the loans and to set the minimum price; the competitiveness of the loan sales process; and the management of conflicts of interest associated with the disposal and with the Northern Ireland advisory committee.<\/p> <p>  The committee will appreciate that it is difficult to address the questions its members have put to us without repeating points made by NAMA's chairman and chief executive officer, CEO, when they appeared before the committee on 29 September.  That is because my colleagues here today and I concur fully with the Chairman and CEO's views.  While I am conscious of the time constraints facing the committee, I feel it is essential that we put on the record our perspective on the issues the committee has asked us to focus on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the financial outcome and the basis for the decision to sell the loans and set the minimum price, I am acutely conscious that some people are of the view that NAMA should not have sold Project Eagle in 2014.  Let me explain, as a board member, the reasons why we did so.  When we became aware of a potential opportunity to sell Project Eagle in one lot, it was one of four possible courses of action open to us, namely, to sell in one lot, sell in more than one lot, defer a sale in favour of selling at some point in the future or retain all of the loans and work them out over a five to seven-year period.  We chose to sell in one lot in 2014.  The NAMA board formed the view that this was the best strategy and that is still our view.  We have seen no credible analysis that would prove that another strategy would have delivered a better outcome.  Selling in more than one lot would, in our view, have delivered an inferior commercial outcome.  The portfolio had a lot of secondary assets.  We simply could not have achieved an acceptable price if those assets had not been bundled with better quality assets.  Deferring a sale would have delivered an inferior outcome.  Northern Ireland commercial property prices have failed to improve since we sold Project Eagle.  All the signs are that the Northern Ireland market may struggle for the foreseeable future until the full implications of Brexit have been absorbed.  Retaining the loans for five to seven years would also have delivered an inferior outcome.  No credible observer would suggest that working out these loans in a post-Brexit world would generate more money than we got.<\/p> <p>  We were acutely conscious then, as we are now, of our obligation under section 10 of the NAMA Act - an obligation placed on us by the Oireachtas - to do our business commercially and expeditiously.  That means taking advantage of opportunities to sell loans and assets when and where it makes commercial sense to do so.  We have never had the luxury with any loans or assets of awaiting some indefinable optimum price level at some indeterminate point in the future.<\/p> <p>  We were also acutely conscious throughout this period from our engagement with the troika, the capital markets and international credit rating agencies, that major progress by NAMA in terms of debt redemption was seen as an important element in Ireland's path to recovery.  NAMA has never acted in a vacuum. <\/p> <p>  For all of these reasons, I have no doubt that if we had turned down the opportunity to sell Project Eagle for &pound;1.322 billion in 2014, the Committee of Public Accounts would now be asking us a different set of questions.  In making the decision to sell, we took account of the potential risks associated with other courses of action and concluded that they were not worth it.  I cannot see how anyone, even operating with the benefit of hindsight, could now take the view that these risks were in fact worth taking.  If NAMA had turned down the newly-presented opportunity to sell the Eagle portfolio in 2014 for &pound;1.322 billion, I believe that it would have been acting in contravention of section 10 of the NAMA Act.  I believe that because the &pound;1.322 billion achieved in 2014 was the best price available in the market at that time and because we did not expect that working out the assets over a longer timeframe would yield a better result.<\/p> <p>  The board's decision in setting a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion for the Eagle portfolio was based on the portfolio's carrying value and the market reality that an non-performing loan discount of at least 10% would apply if the loan sale were to proceed.<\/p><p>If the reserve price had been too low, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has implied, it was likely that several bidders would have matched the reserve price with a view to acquiring the portfolio and realising the surplus value that was allegedly mispriced by NAMA.  Nobody has offered a credible explanation as to why some very sharp investors somehow failed to identify this alleged mispricing opportunity.<\/p><p> In contrast, an e-mail from Fortress Investment Group, the underbidder, to the NAMA CEO in April 2014 showed that while Fortress Investment Group was &ldquo;eager&rdquo; to acquire the portfolio, it was \"unwilling to pay NAMA's minimum price\".  In the e-mail, Fortress Investment Group added: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t hit your reserve we&rsquo;d like to continue discussions with you either for the whole thing or some subset of it&rdquo;.  I have circulated a copy of that e-mail to the committee.  As it happened, this offer was moot as the bid from Cerberus exceeded the minimum price set by the NAMA board.  It strikes me that no recognition is given in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to the commercial reality of an upfront discount associated with a bulk sale of loans versus working out loans individually over an extended timeframe.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged at the end of the Committee of Public Accounts meeting on 29 September 2016 that the 5.5% discount rate was not a market discount rate.  In other words, no buyer would value the portfolio at a 5.5% discount rate.  A similar view was expressed by Department of Finance officials at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting on 6 October.  However, the key finding in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, that NAMA made a \"probable loss\" on this sale, is derived from the mistaken assumption that a 5.5% discount rate, not the market discount of at least 10%, should have applied.  This is like comparing apples and oranges and is not a fair or reasonable comparison.  It is certainly a very fragile and hollow basis on which to ground one of the major findings of the report.  It should be borne in mind that NAMA had in-house board and senior management expertise that would have guided the board as regards market discounts for portfolios of this type.<\/p><p> I share the concern of the NAMA chairman that the Comptroller and Auditor General ignored the independent market expert advice received by NAMA on this point, while failing to put forward any independent market advice which would support his own position.  This is the key point.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's statement that NAMA made a \"probable\" loss of &pound;190 million on the Project Eagle sale is based on an assumption and a comparison that is simply wrong.  The word \"probable\", which carries very specific connotations, was an amendment to the finding of a &ldquo;potential&rdquo; loss which appeared in the final draft submitted to the Minister for Finance and to NAMA.  NAMA was not provided an opportunity to respond to this amended wording.  We find the reference entirely incongruous with the Comptroller and Auditor General's evidence before this committee that \"it is incorrect for my report to be characterised as stating that the discount rate of 5.5% was to be used in arriving at a likely market value ... This is not what the report says&rdquo;.  The \"probable loss\" only arises if one considers that a discount rate of 5.5% was appropriate for the Project Eagle portfolio.  If one takes the market view of the appropriate discount rate, there is no loss, probable, potential or otherwise.  Moreover, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said he has not received sufficient assurance that a different course of action would not have delivered a better outcome, yet no one &ndash; not the Comptroller and Auditor General or any market participant &ndash; has offered any convincing evidence that a better outcome was available, either then or later.<\/p><p> I will turn to the competitiveness of the loan sale process.  Questions have also been raised about the extent to which the sales process was competitive.  The fact is that nine of the largest loan purchasers in the world were approached on Project Eagle, five of whom proceeded with due diligence and two of whom ultimately submitted bids based on their view as to what the portfolio was worth.  The fact that there were two final bidders is a common outcome for many loan sales and to describe the process as uncompetitive is simply wrong.  As any loan sales specialist will attest, a competition that is time bound and focused on the most credible bidders is not unusual in the loan sales market.  As was explained by the chairman on 29 September last, there were very good reasons for opting for a time bound and focused competition in the case of Project Eagle.<\/p><p> Let me be clear - the NAMA board would not have continued with this sale if the sales process was not competitive.  Lazard was categorical in advising the board that the sales process was competitive throughout and ultimately delivered the best outcome.  To believe otherwise is to believe that my colleagues and I deliberately and consciously chose a course of action that would harm the interests of the State.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have always taken our obligations very seriously and it not credible to suggest that, on this one occasion, the board was collectively derelict in its duty to taxpayers.  Section 18(3) of the NAMA Act requires the board to \"act in utmost good faith with care, skill and diligence\" in making its decisions.  I can assure the committee that we fully discharged this statutory duty.<\/p><p> I and other board members were satisfied, based on Lazard&rsquo;s unequivocal expert advice to the board, that all major credible investors with the capacity to submit bids for a portfolio of this scale and granularity were approached during the process and that all investors that had a serious interest in acquiring the portfolio had adequate time and information to enable them to prepare and submit firm bids.  There was no qualified recommendation from Lazard as has been suggested.  On that basis, I and my colleagues were satisfied that the best price achievable for the portfolio was achieved.  The board rejects the Comptroller and Auditor General's unsubstantiated suggestion that serious credible bidders were excluded from the process.<\/p><p> On the sales process itself, we believe that the Comptroller and Auditor also failed to take account of the wider political, economic and financial implications in Northern Ireland of NAMA&rsquo;s decision to sell the Project Eagle portfolio and the obligations on NAMA as a State agency in Dublin to be cognisant of the concerns of the Northern Ireland Executive and of the Irish Government.  Northern Ireland could never have been viewed by NAMA in the same way as it would have viewed other jurisdictions to which it also had significant exposure.  NAMA&rsquo;s exposure in those jurisdictions was minuscule by reference to the size of their property markets.  This was not the case in Northern Ireland.  I believe that NAMA&rsquo;s perspective on this would be widely shared in the Oireachtas - given the recent history of this island, it would have been unthinkable for NAMA to have ignored the impact of its actions on the Northern Ireland economy and on North-South relations.<\/p><p> Turning to the management of conflicts of interest associated with the disposal and with the Northern Ireland advisory committee, I will conclude by dealing with concerns over Mr. Cushnahan&rsquo;s alleged conflict of interest.  We take strong exception to the suggestion that the process was corrupted by Mr. Cushnahan&rsquo;s alleged activities.  As the NAMA chairman pointed out to this committee on 29 September last, Mr. Cushnahan may have sought to represent himself as a key pivot between debtors, investors and politicians but he had no influence with NAMA and his alleged activities had no impact on the price ultimately achieved.<\/p><p> Following my appointment to the committee in mid-2011, I attended every meeting of the Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC.  I can attest at first hand that there was no discussion of individual debtors or individual debtor assets at those meetings.  Nothing said at those meetings would have been of any benefit to any NAMA Northern Ireland debtor or to anybody seeking to buy assets from a NAMA Northern Ireland debtor.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's view on the management of conflict of interests reflects a subjective opinion exercised with hindsight by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The board by contrast had to rely on its judgment and knowledge in March 2014, and prior to that, and within the legal parameters applicable.  What was, in fact, regularly discussed at the NIAC was the state of the Northern Ireland property market and of the wider Northern Ireland economy.  We heard from various Northern Ireland economists and property market experts and the message was far from positive or confident about the future.<\/p><p>In 2012, we were given a presentation by a leading Northern Ireland economist.  The title of that presentation says a lot, An Overview of the Regional Economy at a time of Balance Sheet Recession and Austerity.  At another meeting in 2013, we received a follow-up presentation from that economist and another, the title of which was Recession, Recovery or Stagnation?  Short and Medium Term Prospects. <\/p><p> There were very few cheerleaders for the Northern Ireland property market and economy during the period from 2010 to 2014.  Indeed, I recall that Mr. Brian Rowntree, another external member of the NIAC, gave a very down-beat assessment of the Northern Ireland economy to the NAMA board and executive in February 2014.  The NAMA board took note of the perspective of the two external members of the NIAC as it provided a useful local insight into Northern Ireland dynamics.  However, strategy towards Northern Ireland debtors and assets was entirely a matter for the board and there was never any doubt about this.  This was confirmed by Mr. Rowntree in his evidence to this committee last week.  During that evidence, Mr. Rowntree also referred to a University of Ulster report on residential land in Northern Ireland.  That report relates solely to residential development land which comprised less than 8% of NAMA&rsquo;s Project Eagle portfolio.  It contains no valuations or NAMA debtor or asset-specific information.  It is, in fact, a high-level overview of residential land holdings held as security by NAMA and by other financial institutions in Northern Ireland.  I understand that a total of five financial institutions contributed data to the research.  NAMA referred to this report in its 2013 annual report, on page 68, and in its 2014 annual report, on page 61.  The report was available to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office as part of its review of Project Eagle, or indeed at any time before that review.  Subsequent to Mr. Rowntree&rsquo;s evidence, we made a copy of this report available to this committee and have published it on our website.<\/p><p> Mr. Rowntree suggested that the information in this report could potentially have been of commercial value if combined with Northern Ireland Housing Executive data on housing requirements.  This aggregated analysis was not available to NAMA during 2012 and 2013 and only became available to NAMA when two Ulster University at Jordanstown, UUJ, staff members made a presentation to the NIAC on 8 September 2014.  This was three months after the sale of Project Eagle concluded in June 2014.  The committee might note that this UUJ information from September 2014 was not provided to Mr. Cushnahan as he had resigned from the NIAC in November 2013, some ten months before.<\/p><p> There has been some comment on the fact that Brown Rudnick and Tughans were employed as strategic advisers by Cerberus after the withdrawal of PIMCO but they were not legal advisors.  It is our understanding that it is not unusual for advisors of all types to transfer to other bidders in these circumstances.  This was confirmed to us by Lazard which stated that, in its experience, it is not uncommon for advisors acting for an investor who withdraws from a process to work subsequently for a different investor who remains in the process.  I gather that this point was also affirmed by the Department of Finance at this committee's meeting on 6 October.<\/p><p> I will conclude by making a number of points.  First, to anyone who doubts whether the financial outcome of this sale was in fact the best achievable, I would respond that no one, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, has demonstrated any other course of action that would have resulted in a better price for the taxpayer.  Second, to anyone who doubts that we were right to sell the loans for more than our minimum price, I would respond that we would get far less if we tried to work them out over time or if we tried to sell them today.  Third, to anyone who doubts that the sales process was competitive, I would respond that it is clear to any objective observer that the underbidder, Fortress, was very disappointed not to acquire Project Eagle.  Notwithstanding its serious interest, it was simply not in a position to match the board&rsquo;s minimum price.  The existence of a highly credible but disappointed underbidder is the single defining characteristic of a competitive sale process.  Finally, to anyone who believes that Mr. Cushnahan&rsquo;s conflict of interest in some way harmed the Irish taxpayer, I would respond that his alleged actions had no bearing whatsoever on the price paid by the winning bidder or on NAMA's decision to sell.  <\/p><p> Commercial decision-making involves deciding on the merits of one course of action over another.  The board accepted that a non-performing loan discount of at least 10% would arise in the sale of the project Eagle portfolio but it was also very much aware of a number of balancing considerations.  The board was satisfied then and now that the minimum reserve price of &pound;1.3 billion was appropriate.  The proceeds realised from Project Eagle made a significant contribution to the major senior debt redemption of &euro;9.1 billion achieved by NAMA in 2014.  This was a significant statement about Ireland in its first year after exiting the troika programme.<\/p><p> We have also saved on costs arising from the management of the Northern Ireland debtor loan portfolio and crucially, we reduced the exposure of Irish taxpayers to the impact of Brexit on property values in Northern Ireland, the north of England and Scotland.  We fully stand over the decision to sell the Project Eagle portfolio for the &pound;1.322 billion price achieved in April 2014 and nothing has occurred in the interim to undermine the sound, strategic and commercial rationale for that sale decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016101800002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Willie Soffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1476781200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Soffe.

It was only very late in the day that other bidders were invited into the process and the timeline seems to have been incredibly tight in terms of assimilating the kind of information that would have been in the data room for other bidders to properly consider any bid they would make.

In this particular case, as was pointed out by our chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, on 29 September, there were special circumstances.  It was the view of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government that we should not be seen to be selling off assets or disrupting the economy of Northern Ireland and that this should be a confidential, as far as possible, and discreet sale.  It is not unusual in the marketplace - my colleagues would have more experience than me of this - to have this sort of limited sales process.  Lazars advised that it was not unusual.  This had to be a time-bound and focused sale.  It would have been unthinkable in the circumstances pertaining in Northern Ireland to spend up to 12 months trying to complete a sale.

We actually did look at it.  We discussed it.  I will explain why we did not do so.  Let us take the example of a debtor who has some borrowings and some assets in Northern Ireland and some in the United Kingdom.  If we decided to separate out the Northern Ireland ones in such a case, we would have to remit recourse in respect of the assets we would be trying to sell in the United Kingdom.  We were trying to ensure we did not separate the portfolio in cases where there was a personal guarantee, for example, because we believed such a move would have damaged the value of part of the borrowing covered by the borrower's personal guarantee.  We believed that if we did separate them out, we could impair the value of the overall portfolio.  That is the reason we did not separate them.  What was common about this was that the borrowers were out of the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.  Not all of their borrowings were in the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.  We felt it was important for us not to give the rights associated with the personal guarantees covering their borrowings by separating out parts of their portfolios.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016101800002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian McEnery"},{"type":"speech","time":1476781200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Yes, I can see that that could be the case.

There may not have been personal recourse in other borrowings.  It is also important to mention another reason.  As part of our strategy around selling loans in bulk, as opposed to the individual assets underneath, we generally try to blend the mix of what goes into a loan sale.  We try to include some good loans, some medium loans and some pretty poor loans that are not generating any income at all.  We felt that if we were going to do a loan sale on a bulk, it was important to mix in poor, medium and high-quality loans.  When we were looking at those assets, we found that some loans in the poor part of the portfolio were not generating income at all.  There was no income coming off of them.  In fact, there would have been a cost associated with holding those assets if we had sold off the other ones.  I will explain why.  There would have been a need for public indemnity insurance in respect of them.  Some of the assets would have been deteriorating.  Security costs and other costs are associated with poor properties and half-built housing units.  Truthfully, the loan process is about trying to get a mix to take to market in order to get rid of the bad ones with the good ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016101800002#E01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian McEnery"},{"type":"speech","time":1476781200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The common denominator is that the loans were owned by people rather than based in Northern Ireland.

It was done because there seemed to be a dearth of information about residential zonings throughout Northern Ireland and incomplete information about them.  The approach that was made to us by the University of Ulster was one where it said, \"Look, you and other financial institutions probably have loans in many of these residential properties.  Can we have a project that identifies the totality of residential land on which there are loans throughout the province?\"  It is possible to go into any local authority or planning authority and find out what is happening in that particular local authority area.  What was lacking was a total picture.  We wanted to find out more about our own residential zonings up there because we were coming from a different jurisdiction and it was important to know the quality.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that emerged in the exercise was that there were a lot of residential zonings that created excess zoning.  One could argue in quite a number of cases that maybe a structure would be returned to agricultural zoning.  The whole purpose was to get a total picture in regard to Northern Ireland.  NAMA funded a similar project here in the Republic but it was much larger.  It was geographical information systems, GIS, project that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government wanted.  It gave information on all types of zoning, whether it was residential, industrial, agricultural or amenity - the whole lot- as well as a lot of information about flood plains, infrastructure deficits and all of that.

The Department has it now and it gives information down through tremendous detail on every planning application and development plan.<\/p> <p>  This was a project to see if we could get a picture of residential zonings throughout the province or throughout Northern Ireland.

On the issue of conflict of interest, we all make declarations annually about any conflict of interest, but at each meeting - I chair the credit committee quite regularly - and at the board meeting, the first item on the agenda is whether there are any disclosures of interest to be made.  From time to time disclosures are made and when the item to which the disclosure applies arises, the individual involved has to leave the meeting and come back when the item is finished.  It happens for various reasons.  People may have a conflict of interest because in their other job they are doing work with various companies.  An example would be a member of staff of NAMA who was, in a previous job, an adviser to a buyer.  That person would have filled in a form and declared that interest.

We also know from an exchange with Mr. Daly when he was before the committee that there are differences of opinion as to whether PIMCO left voluntarily or whether it withdrew.

I am nearly finished.  Mr. Soffe said a few minutes ago that the board took a very strong view that PIMCO had to go.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General first attended the committee on this subject, I put that to him.  He had looked at all the documentation that was available in terms of the conference calls, notes that were taken by the legal team from NAMA and others, and he came to the view that PIMCO voluntarily withdrew from the process.  Let us look at what is said in the report.  We have it up on the screen.  It is under the heading of \"Conference calls\".  It states, \"The Head of Asset Recovery enquired about &lsquo;other options&rsquo;\".  This was when there was a discussion after PIMCO made NAMA aware of the success fee.  The head of asset recovery at the time was Mr. Ronnie Hanna.  He was asking about other options.  He then asked if the deal could be \"shaped differently for the arrangement fee to come out\".  There was a bit of toing and froing between the boards.<\/p> <p>  What is in the documentation that was presented to the Comptroller and Auditor General seems to be in stark contrast to Mr. Daly's assertion when he was before the committee that PIMCO had to go and to what Mr. Soffe has said today.  When Mr. Daly was pressed on this, he came back and said that NAMA had to nuance its strategy and be tactical.  What did that mean?  Did something get lost in translation between Mr. Hanna leaving the board meeting at which there was an understanding that PIMCO had to go, if that is what happened, and seeing whether NAMA could shape it differently for the arrangement fee to come out to keep PIMCO in the game?  It does not seem to stack up, does it not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016101800002#K04700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476781200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The reference the Deputy makes is on page 158 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.

He stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General made unsubstantiated suggestions and that he had failed to take account of certain items and that he expressed a subjective opinion.  If the NAMA story is such a good story, why has Mr. Soffe come in here to make ten specific attacks on the person who wrote the report?

I know the witnesses have a job to do, and I thank them for coming in, but can I say that, for the three of them, this has been a public relations disaster.  To sign off collectively on a statement like this, with the inferences it contains, is a PR disaster for them.  The public relations management in NAMA has not always been the best, and this is another example of it.  Some of the inferences in the statement are unacceptable by virtue of the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General and his colleagues are just doing their job.  They are not declaring any wrongdoing in regard to anyone.  They are just doing a report, which is their role, and to make comments like that was unacceptable.

In fairness, this tallies with point 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General which states, &quot;NAMA has stated that the factors that influenced its decision to change its Northern Ireland strategy were the emergence of the loan sale option, the political and crossjurisdictional context in which it held the Northern Ireland debtor assets, and its assessment that its relationship with the Northern Ireland debtors was deteriorating&quot;.  There is also a reference to the widespread lack of co-operation.<\/p><p>Section 10 of the National Asset Management Agency Act must be observed on one side while, on the other side, one must be cognisant of other factors, the first being political pressure.  Let us be frank about that.  One should remember that politicians in Northern Ireland were not under the same limitations as all of us here in the South in regard to interacting with NAMA.  Diplomacy issues are high up the list.  There was a lack of debtor engagement.<\/p><p>The fourth factor is business risk.  One could probably legitimately add Brexit to that but there were other business risks.  These factors are on one side and section 10 of the National Asset Management Agency Act is the other.  Therefore, there was weighting taking place.<\/p><p>One should remember there was a<i>volte face<\/i>, going from a firesale to what was literally one bulk sale.  Once this option became available, combined with the four factors I have mentioned, was it not the case that NAMA basically could not look a gift horse in the mouth and that the idea of selling in one bulk sale for the amount in question was just worthwhile, even in light of the competition associated with section 10 of the National Asset Management Agency Act with regard to getting best value?

My colleague when questioning the Minister for Finance made reference to no smoke without fire, which generated plenty of chuckles.  However, during these hearings, there has been plenty of stoking of the coals.  Every so often, little sparks emanate and we get nuggets of information but it is taking plenty of stoking to get them.  One of the core points that is ultimately our objective to examine is the issue of a probable loss.  Mr. McEnery and the NAMA chairman stressed this was a good deal.  The Minister for Finance has wished us well in finding the truth.  The question of motivation is central.  Mr. Soffe said in his opening contribution that the process would not continue if it was not competitive and three times he said that no political pressure was brought to bear.  I would like to reflect on what the Minister for Finance said during his appearance before the committee because he was at pains to present what he called \"a context\" for what was happening in the overall economy.  I find this strange.  Why would the Minister, who was at pains to say he was at a remove from NAMA's commercial decisions and is prohibited from being involved in them, detail context for us?  He spoke of how the impaired loans were a drag on Ireland and its ability to re-enter the bond market and at that point, he swivelled in his chair and he pointed towards the Comptroller and Auditor, saying, \"You did not have the ECB or the troika breathing down your neck\".  This is unbelievable stuff.  It equated to an attack on Mr. McCarthy.  Given those statements, did the NAMA board members have the Minister breathing down their necks?  Did he influence, pressurise or even suggest that they get this done as quickly as possible and get it in the bag?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016101800002#W03600","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476781200,"counter":568,"content":"<p>We were brought under no pressure to sell in connection with Project Eagle.

The Act asked us to deal with the assets expeditiously.  The word \"expeditiously\" is used twice in section 10.<\/p><p>I recall the Minister saying three things when he spoke to the board.  One was that where there is the opportunity, debt should be paid down as quickly as possible.  Second, he told us to see what we could do to deliver housing.

Now we had to push it to 4,000 per annum on average.  The third point he made was on the docklands strategic development zone, SDZ.

That is how the &pound;190 million was calculated, by virtue of the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General has discounted the future value of the cash flows that both his office and NAMA agreed on at the end of December 2013.  We both agreed on them and he signed off on the financial statement.  We were<i>ad idem<\/i>on that.  What then happened was that we decided that 5.5% was not realistic.  That was one factor.<br\/><br\/>Another factor we considered was the following.  It should be noted that the 5.5% rate was in our paper.  When NAMA acquired these loans from the participating institutions back in 2009, consideration was given to what was termed the long-term economic value uplift.  What we deducted from that was a cost for enforcement or a carrying cost into the future for these loans.  We took off a discount.  There was an uplift, the long term economic value and then when we bought those loans, we applied a discount to reflect the fact that we would have enforcement costs.  We also said in our paper of December 2013 that a purchaser would not buy these if there was not a discount and that explains the 10% that is referred to on the last page of that paper.<br\/><br\/>We approached it on a number of fronts to come to that &pound;1.3 billion figure.

He said he had been a member of the NIAC and that what he termed \"sensitive information\" was put in front of him every day.  As an outside member, Mr. Cushnahan was the other one.  He as good as said that that information could be construed and used afterwards, if one were to be in Mr. Cushnahan's situation where he was advising six or seven people who owned 50% of the portfolio in Northern Ireland.  He said it was not hard to identify individual debtors from what they were getting at those meetings.  They were not allowed to bring that information out of the meeting.  It was given to them at those advisory meetings and then taken back before they left, but he said it would not be difficult for any individual to identify debtors and assets from the information they were getting.  The witnesses are saying, however, that Mr. Rowntree or Mr. Cushnahan had no information whatsoever that they could bring forward for their own benefit.  We hoped it would not turn out that way but that will have to be proven.  Have the witnesses any comment on what Mr. Rowntree said?  In his evidence, he was adamant that what they were shown at meetings could be used to identify individual debtors and assets that they were speaking about.

The NAMA board responded, and it is minuted, that there were gains from the board's perspective.  You personally as board directors, not other people, came to the view that there were gains on asset sales due to close of potential benefit to Cerberus of &pound;14.1 million that had not been priced in the bid.

Nowhere does the Comptroller and Auditor General say that if and when a decision was taken by the board to embark on a loan sale strategy market rates would not apply.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not say that.  He says that when the board made a decision to change strategy the value was &pound;1.49 billion.  To be fair to the Comptroller and Auditor General that is what he is saying.  It is an important distinction that has been lost and there is maybe a disingenuous response to what he is saying.  We have to be fair and factual about what he said in his report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016101800002#EE00350","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476781200,"counter":835,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General says in the clarification on 29 September that 5.5% was not a market discount.

The meeting was held at 4.30 p.m.  Mr. Frank Daly, Mr. Ellingham, Mr. McEnery and Mr. Soffe were on the phone and were not in the meeting room.  The only person in the boardroom was Mr. Brendan McDonagh.  Will the witnesses give us a flavour of how this happened?  The board members were all in different parts of the country or the globe and they were all at the other end of the phone.  We have heard about board packs getting to them and forms to be signed about declarations of interest.

I asked him whether he was aware of a meeting on 25 March 2014, so this was between the board meetings.  The NAMA board was not meeting at this stage but I will tell the witnesses who was meeting.  It was Peter Robinson, then First Minister in the North, Dan Quayle from Cerberus, Ian Coulter, managing partner of Tughans solicitors, and Simon Hamilton, who was the successor to Sammy Wilson as the Northern finance Minister.  Mr. Daly said he had no knowledge that meeting with Cerberus had happened, but he also told me he had had a conversation with John Snow, who is the chairman of Cerberus.  The witnesses are probably familiar with Mr. Snow's name.  He told me that phone conversation happened sometime towards the end of March.  I do not see in the minutes of the board meeting where the board was presented with this information.  It was told a decision was needed on Cerberus and by the way it has these fees.  To me, this is presenting the board with a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  That is how it reads to me.

It further noted that Frank Cushnahan had not resigned as a member of the NIAC until 7 November 2013.  Can Mr. Soffe explain the reference to April 2013?  We know that the initial letter from Brown Rudnick to Mr. Peter Robinson issued in June 2013 and that NAMA was informed in July 2013 about the interested parties.  However, it is stated in the minutes that the board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations had commenced in April 2013.  In terms of my understanding of the minutes, that means that the fixer's fee or success fee was agreed with Mr. Cushnahan in April 2013.

I am joined by my colleague Garrett Murray, the department manager of our policy team and in the Visitors Gallery by Ms Deirdre McPartlin and Ms Anne Lanigan who are part of our newly established Brexit team.<\/p> <p>  The committee will know that Enterprise Ireland's activities are focused on supporting indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services companies.  We also have a responsibility for overseas direct investment in to Ireland in the food area. We support more than 5,000 companies in those areas.  The contribution from those companies in employment is felt throughout the State, in every town, village and county.  In 2015 those companies recorded record employment growth of 21,118 jobs, a net of 10,169 jobs.  Of that increase, 64% of those jobs were created outside of Dublin.  The total spend of those companies in Ireland was &euro;23.8 billion in 2015 and between them their exports accounted for &euro;20.6 billion, a 10% increase on 2014.  We are forecasting that this year, those exports will reach the target we set of &euro;22 billion.<\/p> <p>  The UK is a very important market which accounted for &euro;7.5 billion of that &euro;20.6 billion.  In 2015 that market grew at the second fastest rate by 12%.  We have, however, seen a trend where the UK market - as a percentage of exports over the last number of years - has decreased from 45% of the total exports of those companies in 2005 to 37% in 2015.  The focus for Enterprise Ireland is to reduce that dependency and increase the penetration into other markets such as northern Europe, the US, Asia and the Middle East.  A total of 1,476 of the 5,000 companies have recorded exports to the UK, so it is a very important market and those companies are significantly impacted by Brexit, as the committee can appreciate.<\/p><p>Of the 1,475 companies which have some level of exports to the UK, 355 have substantial exposure to the UK market and employ more than 24,900 people.  Over 200 of those 355 companies would be deemed to be particularly challenged because they have a high level of sales to the UK.  The UK is and will continue to be the largest market for Irish exporters in the short term.  Our current activities and strategy for 2017 to 2020, which we are currently developing, will have the twin focus of trying to sustain and deepen the exports of those companies to the UK market and also expand their reach into other markets.<\/p><p> The primary cause of uncertainty in the short term as a result of the Brexit vote is currency volatility.  On 7 October the exchange rate went over 90p.  The sectors that are most impacted by that and which have a high level of exports to the UK are our construction services, engineering, agriculture machinery, timber, furniture and food industry.  What is also very clear is that the impact of Brexit will not be temporary.  It is structural change and we need to respond to it in that way.  It requires a strategic response from Irish exporters and from Enterprise Ireland.  <\/p><p> It is not the first time we have been in this situation.  In 2009, when the euro and sterling were near parity, Irish companies successfully overcame those challenges, even though they went through a very painful process.  Brexit will drive companies to focus on increasing their competitiveness, on innovation and on differentiating their products from their competition in parallel with going after new export markets.  We are putting a lot of effort into supporting them in that area.<\/p><p> We surveyed our clients in the last number of months on their view on Brexit and their exposure.  Of those companies, 29% said they did not expect the UK exit to impact substantially on their projections; 47% said it is too early to tell; and 26% said they will immediately focus on diversification.  From Enterprise Ireland's perspective, we are focusing on supporting those companies in the areas of market diversification, planning their next steps, competitiveness and information innovation.  As soon as the Brexit vote was announced, we launched a five pillar response in terms of our strategy.  I will not go through the details because it is publicly available.  It was focused on helping them with information about how to immediately respond from a currency point of view in terms of hedging; on trying to respond within the UK market and helping them to identify and progress their objectives in other markets; and on competitiveness and innovation.<\/p><p> The majority of our work with companies is on a one-to-one basis but we also work on the response of specific sectors.  Two weeks ago was international markets week and we brought 140 of our overseas team, which is virtually all our overseas team, back to Ireland to meet with over 400 companies that are most exposed.  During that week, we held over 1,400 one-to-one meetings with those companies.  They were focused on assisting those companies plan for what is ahead.  We also had a briefing to hear advice from entrepreneurs who have succeeded in scaling their business in international markets.  During that week, we also held a number of specific sector workshops with sectors that are most exposed to Brexit to help them respond at a company and sector level.  That was about understanding and defining the particular challenges and opportunities faced in each sector.  That is central to our approach.  <\/p><p> Brexit will continue to pose challenges for Irish exporters.  This will be a marathon and not a sprint.  It is very important to say that it creates opportunities.  There are a series of sectors where there are specific opportunities.  Our past experience of downturns and other challenges have positioned companies and incentivised them to look at other markets and broaden their base.  Our focus will be on driving scale and expanding the reach of companies.  That is what our strategy is focused on.  Let there be no doubt that at the moment we have the strongest cohort of indigenous Irish companies that we have ever had.  Part of that is a function of us having come through a very difficult period during which companies had to improve their competitiveness and focus on improving their international competitiveness.  We are optimistic about the potential for Irish companies to come through this period of great difficulty stronger and to build their export base during that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1176,"content":"<p>I now ask Ms Mary Buckley, executive director of IDA Ireland, to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting IDA Ireland to attend to discuss the likely economic impact of Brexit.  I am accompanied this evening by my colleague, Mr. Denis Curran, who is the manager of our financial services division.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has performed extremely well in attracting FDI over many years.  We have over 1,200 FDI companies employing over 187,000 people.  These companies account for more than two-thirds of the corporation tax take in Ireland.  They account for &euro;130 billion in exports and they contribute &euro;9 billion in pay per annum.  The years 2015 and 2016 have been excellent ones for FDI.  IDA client companies created just under 19,000 jobs on the ground during 2015 across a range of sectors, with every region of Ireland posting net gains in jobs.  In 2015, 213 companies invested in Ireland, 94 of which were investing in Ireland for the first time.  Our mid-year results for 2016 were announced in July and show we are ahead of the first half of last year, with 9,100 jobs created and 115 investments secured.  Ireland&rsquo;s stable business environment and certain access to the EU market means Ireland is extremely well placed to win new FDI investments in Europe.  Ireland has a unique perspective and interest in Brexit.  Our relationship with the UK is closer than with any other member state.  Brexit is not what we hoped for but we fully respect the decision of the British people.  Ireland will continue to be a core member of the EU single market and euro currency.  This is one of the key reasons that companies choose Ireland as a place to locate.<\/p> <p>  IDA believes there are potential opportunities for Ireland arising from the vote by the UK to leave the European Union.  However, quantifying these at this point is not possible.  Ireland has a strong track record in winning FDI.  In terms of employment creation from FDI over the past four years, Ireland has been second only to the UK in the areas of technology, consumer and content business services and international financial services.  We also have strong attributes that are of interest to global companies: we are English-speaking; we are a member of the European Union and the eurozone; we have a common law legal system similar to the UK; and we have a direct land border and close geographical and cultural links with the UK.  Ireland also provides an opportunity to passport into the wider the European Union market from any part of Ireland.  We believe these attributes are of interest to companies but the best way to explore these ideas is through direct contact with companies, existing or potential.<\/p> <p>  Areas of increased FDI interest are likely to be services companies such as international financial services, technology, consumer and content business and life sciences in the short term and in the medium term in the manufacturing sector and pharmaceuticals, bio-pharmaceuticals, med-tech and engineering.  There are a few different categories of clients and potential clients where we see opportunities: existing IDA clients with a presence in Ireland who also have a presence in the UK; overseas clients who have a presence in the UK but not in Ireland; UK companies operating in the UK which now need certain access to the European market and international clients without a presence in Europe seeking a European base.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland has taken a number of steps to ensure we carefully manage the uncertainty the vote has created.  We are members of the Brexit co-ordination group established by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  The group consists of the CEOs of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, as well as relevant enterprise, single market and trade officials from the Department.  The group has met on a number of occasions since June to address the response to the referendum result and the messaging to business both domestically and overseas.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has continued to chair the group as part of the Department's ongoing response as developments unfold.  We have established an internal Brexit team at senior level.  Following the vote, we wrote to 1,200 of our existing clients to reassure them Ireland will remain in the European Union, to remind them of Ireland&rsquo;s positive attributes including talent, skills, tax and ease of doing business and to offer assistance, advice and support.  We have also initiated a global advertising campaign highlighting Ireland's attributes as a key European FDI location and this will be supported by further public relations activities later this year.<\/p><p> Every investment agency in the world will be competing to win mobile investment in a post-Brexit environment.  Notwithstanding our strong baseline position, Brexit will result in risks in the short and medium term.  These risks include a long period of uncertainty leading to the stalling of investments, dampening of FDI growth and, consequently, global FDI flows, decreased attractiveness of the European market, direct impact on existing IDA client companies, some of which are heavily exposed to UK and the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy.  The shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit is, as yet, unknown.  It is important that we monitor developments to continually assess the implications of whatever model emerges in terms of its impact on Ireland's attractiveness for FDI relative to the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Aidan Gough from InterTradeIreland to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1180,"content":"<p>InterTradeIreland is an implementation body mandated by the Governments of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom to promote and develop cross-Border trade and business development opportunities.  As an implementation body, InterTradeIreland is preparing to help North-South trade, innovation and business development linkages continue to flourish in whatever trading relationships emerge from the UK-EU negotiations.  Cross-Border co-operation and trade has been a success story during the past 16 to 18 years.  Cross-Border trade in goods and services, which stands at over &euro;6 billion, has more than doubled during the past 18 years.  We have worked with more than 30,000 businesses across the whole island.  We emphasise the whole island as part of our corporate strategy to ensure we work with businesses in every county, and we have done it successfully.  We have created nearly 10,000 jobs in SMEs across the island and we have generated, through our initiatives for businesses, over &pound;1 billion of added value.<\/p> <p>  The Republic of Ireland, ROI, market accounts for 16% of the external sales of Northern Ireland companies.  As the external sales figure includes sales to Britain, approximately 38% of Northern Ireland's exports go to the South.  Approximately 62% of Northern Ireland's total exports to the EU are to the South.  The Northern Ireland market is especially significant for smaller Irish firms with nearly one sixth of exports from Irish small firms going North, while approximately two thirds of Northern Ireland's exports from small firms go to the South.  We have a highly integrated market across the island.  It is also very sectorally specific, with some sectors being almost an all-island industry, particularly the agrifood industry.  We may want to talk about it later.<\/p> <p>  The potentially negative impact of a Brexit on cross-Border trade and business development has been highlighted in a number of reports.  Our business monitor, which surveys approximately 1,000 CEOs in businesses across the island on a quarterly basis, shows the outcome of the Brexit referendum has caught a large majority of businesses offside.  The report indicated that 97% of businesses in Ireland have no plan in place to deal with the consequences of the vote to leave, and that 92% of export businesses have no plan for this eventuality.  The negative implications of the uncertainty - and it is the uncertainty that is causing the problems - created by the referendum result in the marketplace are reflected by the fact that one in five Irish firms reported that they planned to decrease their level or speed of investment.  Approximately three in five Irish businesses believe Brexit will have a negative impact on cross-Border sales.  This is a much higher figure than Northern Ireland businesses, of which one in four said it would have a negative impact, but I am sure this reflects the way exchange rates have moved.<\/p> <p>  Supporting businesses, particularly small businesses, to navigate the uncertain landscape and realise their growth ambitions as the new terms and conditions of the UK's new relationship with Europe emerge will form a critical part of our work programme over the next few years.  We are well placed to engage with SMEs across the island.  Our corporate e-zine will keep us in contact with businesses.  It circulates to over 15,000 businesses ten times a year.  The key is to get information to the businesses to help them navigate the uncertainty and present the facts where we can.  Our all-island business monitor also keeps us close, in a listening mode, to the challenges businesses are facing.  Our range of cross-Border trade programmes will become even more attractive to exporters and to inexperienced and first-time exporters in particular.  The range includes our Acumen and Elevate programmes, which help small or micro businesses take the first step onto the export ladder.  We also offer our trade accelerator vouchers and we expect a big increase in demand for all these supports.<\/p> <p>  We are also examining what we can do in the future.  In the short term it is information based.  We are exploring the development of a model that will allow us to assess the impact of tariffs on cross-Border trade.  The impact of Brexit will be sectorally specific and even within sectors there will be greatly differentiated impacts depending on the products.  With the WTO tariffs there is great variety and it will be greatest in the agrifood sector.  Even there, the average EU trade-weighted WTO tariff is approximately 2.3% for non-agricultural products but approximately 22% for agricultural products.  Agrifood is a massive sector, accounting for 52% of cross-Border trade.  Even within agrifood there is great variety in tariffs and we are particularly concerned in a number of areas.  For example, there are three flour mills in the island, two of which are in Belfast, and the Belfast mills export 60% of their output to the South.  The EU tariff on flour is 65%.  This could decimate one industry.  We must get down to very granular detail and we hope to provide this advice to businesses as negotiations emerge and we see the tariff levels and where they will be imposed.<\/p> <p>  Meanwhile, we are encouraging businesses to continue to grow through exporting and developing the cross-Border market.  We are advising them to focus on the things they can control.  While there is much uncertainty, there are certain things they can control and they all make good business sense in any event.  They can develop their customer and supplier relationships, which can add value to a contract.  We know 70% or 80% of the businesses we work with do not even have a business plan.  It is critical when navigating the landscape to have some idea of the different scenarios one could face.<\/p><p> We are encouraging businesses to diversify.  If one is selling one product to one market, which many cross-Border traders are doing, one is heavily exposed.  We are encouraging them to diversify.  Linked to that, we are encouraging them to innovate because uniqueness adds value that can provide a buffer if tariffs are imposed or increased.  Obviously, there is the question of currency hedging.  A emerging problem is that the deals of companies have already hedged are starting to run out.<\/p><p> As I said, we are piloting a series of Brexit breakfasts between now and Christmas along the Border area and in the Border counties, where the impact will be felt.  InterTradeIreland, as an implementation body, is prepared to help North-South trade innovation and business development linkages to flourish in whatever new relationships emerge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Gough","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for the three presentations.

Just short of 1,500 companies, which we have identified as exporting to the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, are affected in different ways.  Some export to multiple markets.  If they are already embedded in a number of other markets, they can switch resources to put more emphasis on those that are not as affected by Brexit, such as other euro-denominated markets or markets that are already established.  Companies with the United Kingdom as their primary market face different factors.  It is too early to say what is likely to emerge in the negotiations by way of tariffs in particular areas but one of the immediate factors to which companies must respond is the exchange rate.  There are a number of strands to this response.  One is that companies immediately look towards their competitiveness.  In the short term, they are looking towards their hedging strategy.  Very importantly, companies are not in the business of gambling on the currency exchange rate.  Therefore, it is about creating certainty for themselves, be it through hedging through financial institutions or natural hedging in terms of some of their sourcing activities.  In some cases, companies will be considering sourcing where they might have been sourcing in other parts of Europe with a view to switching some of that sourcing into the United Kingdom so they have a natural hedge.  That type of activity is taking place.<\/p> <p>  With regard to other responses, we have seen companies in certain sectors opting for price increases in the United Kingdom.  Some have been successful.  Actually, it is not just Irish companies that are affected.  There are substantial additional exporters to the United Kingdom, and they are also affected by the same factors.  It is not just Irish companies looking for increases.  This is likely to lead to knock-on inflation in the UK market.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the 47% that said there has been no change, they said there has been no change for the moment because of the relative uncertainty in the market.  However, as we move towards hardening positions, the companies are moving towards spreading their risk and considering other markets.  One of the factors in this regard is that Enterprise Ireland is providing a lot of support to companies in evaluating options for other markets, including in respect of the questions as to how transportable their products are, how attractive those products are in other markets, and how well positioned the companies are to go after other markets.  The first port of call for companies whose primary export market is the United Kingdom is other English-speaking markets.  This is because language skills and culture are important.  One finds that the United States and some other English-speaking markets are very important.  With regard to our activities in this area, we brought virtually all our overseas team back two weeks ago to engage in the discussions and work with the companies.  That is not something that happened this week or last week.  It is something we have been doing for some time but the urgency associated with it has increased.

We have reduced our numbers substantially in recent years.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Murray, to talk specifically about the current numbers.<\/p> <p>  We have not reduced our resources overseas.

We are in discussions with the Department on the deployment of these staff.

It goes back to what was said about the Asia Pacific region and the eastern side of the globe where 4.5 billion people live, or 60% of the world's population.  I understand, however, that there is a lot less income than in the western world, but, as was rightly stated, there is an emerging market with the growth of the middle class.  How much of an increase in resources was there in the Asia Pacific region in the past 24 to 36 months?  I see from the figures that Irish exports to the region have increased.  Is a specific strategy being put in place for it, given what has happened with Brexit?  On IDA Ireland looking at foreign direct investment and competing with the United Kingdom, at the recent EU symposium the British ambassador, Mr. Robin Barnett, mentioned that the United Kingdom was looking at increased trade with Asia and towards a Singaporean model.  That would put us in direct competition with it for foreign direct investment, as mentioned.  Is there a strategy in place to attract Asian companies to Ireland and compete against the United Kingdom?  What is the strategy between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and is there joined-up thinking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#E00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1197,"content":"<p>With regard to the resources we have available in the Asia Pacific region, even though like any agency we have reduced our resources overall, we have actually increased them in the Asia Pacific region.  We have allocated an additional ten staff in the region in the past 36 months.  We also have a resource in Ireland, the high growth market team, which is focused on assisting companies to prepare for tackling these markets.  We have eight offices and 39 staff in these markets.  We also have a network of what we call pathfinders, or trade consultants, which represent a variable cost to us.  They have specific expertise in certain sectors and we support companies to utilise them.<\/p> <p>  The market in the Asia Pacific region is growing.  Exports to the region have grown by 70% in the past four years.  The number of client companies which are exporting to it is approximately 620, a 15% increase in the same period.  It is a region that requires a very sharp focus because while it is big and has strong growth rates, the timescale to secure business in the market is longer than in other established markets.  The committing of boots on the ground is critical, not just by Enterprise Ireland but also by companies.<\/p> <p>  It is not a case of either-or, that we go after the market in the Asia Pacific region and not other established markets.  The United States and Europe are very important markets.  We were very clear that we would not take resources from these established markets and place them in high growth markets; they had to be additional resources.  Today, we have an international education trade mission to China led by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Next month we will have a trade mission to China and Japan.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has returned from a trade mission to attract investment in the financial services sector.  It is a constant focus for us in terms of trade missions and activities.  Obviously, high level missions led by Ministers are particularly important in these regions, where government to government interaction is so important, but that is not to take away from other markets.  Last year the growth rate among Irish indigenous companies exporting to the United States was 27%.  It is about focusing on both and not a case of either-or.<\/p> <p>  On foreign direct investment, as part of our activities in the market Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the food sector and our trade missions to the Asia Pacific region have been partly focused on food products.  Recently the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, was in the region on a food and agri-tech mission.  Foreign direct investment is a key part of this activity.  The Chinese are very interested in baby infant formula because they had a big issue and scares associated with it in terms of the quality of product from their own producers.  My colleague from IDA Ireland, Ms Buckley, may also want to comment on the foreign direct investment aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>We have nine offices in six locations in the Asia Pacific region, including Bangalore and Mumbai in India and Japan.

My first question is on funding.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and InterTradeIreland do a phenomenal job and as such, I was disappointed to see that only &euro;3 million had been allocated in the budget.  The figures speak for themselves in terms of the trade risk to various sectors.  The sum of &euro;3 million allocated in the budget represented only one fifth of 1% of the fiscal space available.<\/p> <p>  I have read through the documents to see what is going on, particularly in the case of Enterprise Ireland engaging with indigenous companies to get them ready to diversify.  It is as clear as day from the data the delegates have provided for the committee from the reports produced that the indigenous sector is not prepared and not thinking about this issue as well as it should.  I see very little interaction on the ground.  Is a sum of &euro;3 million enough to prepare Ireland for what will probably be the biggest macro shock the indigenous sector will experience, I hope, for quite some time?  To me, it does not seem it will be enough for the agencies to do what they are speaking about.  For example, Mr. Gough spoke about organising breakfast briefings.  Certainly, those involved in the business sector in County Wicklow do not believe they are proactively been engaged with.  Perhaps this is because the agencies are still ramping up and the money is being allocated and the teams are being hired.  Could the agencies usefully put a sum of &euro;10 million to work?<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the Brexit co-ordination group.  It seems to be quite a small group of people or bodies.  Is any Department other than the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation represented in it?  If not, would the agencies welcome the representatives of others?  Is there any employer group represented in it such as ISME, IBEC or the Small Firms Association?  If not, do the agencies think they should be?<\/p><p> My final question, which is probably mainly to Mr. Gough, is around informal talks.  The Government must take a position that all negotiations will be between the UK and the remaining 27 member states but I hope that there are intense and detailed informal talks going on, the most obvious of which are between the North and the South.  I ask Mr. Gough for InterTradeIreland and for EI and IDA Ireland, what level of informal talks are going on.  Are these talks getting into, for instance, the example of the flour mills?  That was a fantastic example of the devil being in the detail.

In the area of agricultural machinery I mentioned, for example, the immediate response in the market for agricultural machinery was that farmers who would be buying agricultural machinery in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was to stop purchasing because they were wondering what would be the situation on the single farm payment and their spend.  Rather than it being a currency or pricing issue, their response was to stop purchasing in the short term which created a greater shock than any exchange rate fluctuation.  What has happened now is that many Irish companies that are also in competition with suppliers from outside of Ireland have sought price increases and have got them, and the market has started to move again.  That situation could change.  They are responding and evolving to the situation as it emerges.<\/p> <p>  Equally, in the case of customers in the UK market, for the majority of Irish companies supplying into that market it is business to business as opposed to business to consumer with the exception of the food sector.  Companies in that area are tied in, by and large, to medium to long-term contracts.  If one is supplying in to the aerospace sector, for example, there is all the approval process to be gone through and from the customer's point of view, switching suppliers is not necessarily easy.  That would be a good example of North-South trade where some Irish companies would be supplying in to Bombardier, never mind in to Great Britain.  Every sector is different and we are having to deal with them on a company-by-company and sector-by-sector basis.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, and as referred to by my colleague in InterTradeIreland, in the case of the companies that are hedged, with few exceptions that hedging was in place until the end of the year.  They are having to look at their pricing strategy for the next contracts coming up and hedging.  It is something that we are staying on top of, and requires us to deal one on one with the companies.  One thing we can say is we have a strong relationship with those companies and would be aware of what their positions are and understand where their exposures are.  It is then based on responding to them one on one and having a plan in place with each of those companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1207,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sherry.

That is across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and our parent Department.  It is 50 additional people above the existing head count.  In terms of the 10% tax rate, what is being referred to is obviously capital gains tax, which was changed from 20% with a &euro;1 million lifetime cap to 10% on a &euro;1 million lifetime cap.  In the case of the UK, it is 10% on a cap of &pound;10 million.  There is no doubt when we look at the startup area that we are in an environment where startups are mobile.  The vast majority of startups that we support are mobile.  We support over 220 new startups every year with investment and other supports.  Those companies can locate anywhere on the globe by and large, which means we have to be competitive.  Tax is an important element of that in terms of capital gains and the incentive for people to build their businesses, but it is not the only factor.  Access to talent, costs and the availability of quality space and other infrastructure are also key.  Access to international markets is also a key factor as are resources, including the resources Enterprise Ireland provides to entrepreneurs.  There is no doubt, however, that the more competitive we can be on the tax side, the better positioned we are on that particular agenda or issue.  However, it is one of a number of issues.  While that is important for companies exiting and for entrepreneurs and investors realising their gains, having companies, entrepreneurs and investors investing in those companies in the first instance is equally important.  As such, the EIIS scheme is very important in terms of a tax incentive for early-stage companies.

The first is on the 50 plus posts.  As Mr. Sherry said, we have to confirm the number.  I referred to boots on the ground earlier and it is important when we are talking about additional resources to note that it is about having resources here to support companies to prepare to go overseas and about having people overseas to help them in the market.  That is where the innovation and competitiveness piece comes in, to be clear.<\/p> <p>  Second, tax is an important pillar, particularly with the mobile nature of entrepreneurship.  We were happy to see an enhancement of the capital gains regime for entrepreneurs but as Mr. Sherry rightly points out that is not all we are looking for.  We also welcome the changes to the foreign-earnings deduction, or FED.  One of the challenges our companies have is that when one is diversifying into foreign markets, one has to get one of one's employees here to go over and do the hard work before one puts a presence full-time on the ground.  FED is a way to incentivise companies to do that.  The amendments to that in the budget were welcome.<\/p> <p>  During the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il, the Minister for Finance launched a consultation exercise on taxation for entrepreneurship.  We had a number of things in there.  One was on share options as announced for next year in the budget.  We welcome that because our companies cannot compete with larger companies in terms of share options.  Attracting talent is as critical if not more critical than other tax elements in the budget.  If one is an international expert or CTO with a particular skill set who is looking across Europe for a place to locate, any place that does not have a competitive share options scheme will not be at the races.  We really welcome the fact that one will be introduced in 2018.<\/p> <p>  On EIIS, while it is important to look at the entrepreneur coming out and at what he or she is getting in terms of capital gain, attracting money into companies is also critical.  In looking at the relative competitiveness of the UK, we should also be looking at the EIS versus the EIIS as well as the capital regimes.

The agencies have achieved phenomenal results.  I also thank the witnesses for their presentations.<\/p> <p>  Comments have been made about whether an allocation of &euro;3 million is enough.  I am sure the witnesses were gagging to say it would be great to get &euro;10 million but, nonetheless, the Department has considerably increased the budget.  It is the biggest increase in ten years.  There is huge competition for funding as there is great need for resources in other areas.<\/p> <p>  It is welcome that the agencies have been able to prepare in the way they have done so.  They are putting feet on the ground because that is what it is all about.  India is one of the areas that interests me, particularly where IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are concerned.  That country is a huge market as it has an official population of 1.3 billion and a couple of hundred million more undocumented people.  When I visited India the people I spoke to hardly knew about Ireland, except for great cricketers from Ireland, who were mainly from north County Dublin.  Only for cricket people in India would not know about Ireland at all.  Irish cricketers are to be commended for giving us more advertising than we could ever afford to pay for in India.  A huge job of work needs to be done in India as it is massive market that is full of opportunity.  Having said that, I do not want to focus on where we are weak, even though we need to address the matter.  Remarkable advances have been made in China and the baby milk sector was mentioned.  Ireland is not just seen as green; Ireland is seen as clean.  That is critically important from the Chinese perspective and with other markets.  I would like the witnesses to comment on the market in India.  It poses a huge opportunity but it is very difficult to break into that market.  I commend Enterprise Ireland for maintaining market activity in the US, UK and Europe where we are already strong in other areas.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gough referred to the flour industry which offers us an opportunity if tariffs lead to a reduced market.  We will not know the situation until Brexit has been completed.  Irish producers will have an opportunity to fill gaps in other areas as English producers will be unable to export in the same way as they do at the moment.  I do not want to create divisions but, equally, there will be opportunities north of the Border on which the South will lose out as Northern companies export to the UK mainland.  I would like to hear a few comments along these lines.<\/p> <p>  All the agencies have done a phenomenal job over the past number of years.  There are huge challenges ahead but it has come across loud and clear that the agencies are preparing for them.  When I was visited these locations as a Minister it was great to see Irish products, and some of them from north County Dublin, on the shelves in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  There is no doubt that the markets are being penetrated and opportunities remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#H00300","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his kind comments.  Next month, the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, will lead a trade mission to India and we will also have a trade mission to the Gulf region that will be led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Both markets are important and quite different.  In terms of the sectors that we go after, both markets are quite different.  India is a market with a huge population.  As the Senator mentioned, our promotion in India has been related to cricketing activities and Ireland's success in the market, and one of Ireland well known cricketers has helped us in that regard.  We have succeeded in substantially increasing the number of international students who come here from India.  This sector will be one of the focuses of the trade mission next month, in addition to ICT and financial services.<\/p> <p>  It is quite difficult to conduct business in India.  My recollection is that India is ranked 138th out of 160 countries in terms of the ease with which to do business.  As the Senator will know, it is not easy to conduct business in India but it affords us huge opportunities.  One of the areas that we must focus on in India are activities in which Irish companies have a competency and in which they are capable of doing business, and where they can undertake those activities in Ireland.  There is not a huge amount for us to gain from supporting companies to undertake activities if they locate their functions to service those opportunities in India.  We want opportunities that can be serviced from Ireland and where value is primarily added in Ireland.  Opportunities in the project management and construction area can be undertaken here and engineering can be designed to be undertaken here, although we must also have boots on the ground in India.<\/p> <p>  We are focused on the Indian market.  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the embassy focus on the Indian market together.  Mumbai is our primary centre of activity in the region.  India remains high on our agenda but the market requires resilience and a marathon, as opposed to something from which we expect to gain meteoric results in the short term.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gough may comment on filling gaps left by UK producers.  At the moment, there is &euro;7.5 billion in exports to the UK and the Northern Ireland and &euro;1 billion of indigenous companies is accounted for by Northern Ireland.  The latter refers to products and services that are produced in the South but sold in Northern Ireland, which is an important market to many companies.

I am sorry for being late as I missed two introductions.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Enterprise Ireland.  Mr. Sherry said in his statement that there has been a trend whereby exports to the UK, as a proportion of total client exports, have declined from 45% in 2005 to 37% in 2015.  I want the delegations to tell me whether we are witnessing a Brexit panic.  A vote on Brexit took place but after Theresa May's speech the currency speculators created uncertainty.  Mr. Sherry, in his statement, said there was a short-term volatility in the market.<\/p><p>The valuation of sterling can go up and down depending on the outcomes of discussions, talks and agreements that may happen when we sit down to work out the detail of Brexit, but a decline was taking place anyway in trade between Britain and Ireland.<\/p><p> I also notice in Enterprise Ireland's statement that reference is made to reorienting towards North America, Canada, Asia and the Middle East.  I ask the representatives of Enterprise Ireland to comment on what they think the impact of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada, the first stages of which are to be signed next week with the European Commission, will be on all its ambitions.  What do they think the impact of the agreement will be and how might it offset any kind of negative impact of Brexit in the Republic of Ireland?<\/p><p> Regarding InterTrade Ireland's presentation, it is interesting to see that one third of all external sales by small companies from the North come south and over 62% of Northern Ireland's total sales to the EU are to Ireland.  Therefore, the market in the Republic of Ireland is clearly very important to the economy in Northern Ireland.  However, given all the sensitivities and in the absence of discussions happening, does InterTrade Ireland see a way around doing specific trade deals within the island, should a hard Brexit go ahead?<\/p><p> I direct my last question to IDA Ireland.  I am delighted to see its figures state a fact that we have been saying for ages, that is, it is not just our tax system that attracts foreign direct investment into this country, but also the fact that we have talent and infrastructure, we are English-speaking, we are a member of the European Union, we are a member of the eurozone and we represent a passport into the European market in general because of our location.  Every time it is said we should try to collect the effective corporation tax of 12.5%, there is another panic, that is, that the companies would all up sticks and leave, whereas in fact the witnesses have all outlined that there are many other factors that make this economy particularly attractive for investment.  However, I am concerned about the IDA and the type of investment it brings in.  We had a discussion at a previous committee about the quality of jobs.  This point is probably separate from but related to Brexit.  I want to know from the IDA, while its representatives are here, whether it does any checking of the quality and types of jobs it funds and attempts to attract in.  Specifically, in the financial sector, we will see many sorts of dodgy companies in the future - I will not mention them here because I probably would be given out to - through which the quality of jobs will drive down working pay and conditions for many people.  The nature of these global corporations is that they provide an app and somebody goes out as a self-employed technician and delivers a service at a very cheap rate for the corporation.  Is the IDA concerned about funding such companies?  They may tick the boxes and show that we are getting jobs, but should we not also be concerned about the quality and standard of jobs and pay that public money pays for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#H00700","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1232,"content":"<p>Any of the witnesses can take the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I will take the first question, which was directed to me, about UK exports.  What we said is that if one goes back to 2005, the percentage of our total exports to the UK was 45%.  That was at a time of a much smaller amount than the &euro;20.6 billion we had in 2015.  The strategy has been very much focused on trying to lessen dependence on one particular market.  Companies that manufacture engineering products are a good example of this.  If we go back ten years, engineering in Ireland was primarily an indigenous industry focused on the domestic market.  Three years ago, the level of exports from the sector exceeded the level of sales in the domestic market for the first time, so it is now predominantly an export-oriented market.  Equally, we have seen transition from companies primarily focusing on the UK markets to Irish engineering companies exporting all around the world, for example, Combilift in Monaghan, which exports its fork-lift trucks to markets all around the globe.  We have seen these successfully competing companies cut their teeth on the near market, namely, the UK market, but they have gone global.  This is true of a range of sectors.  We have put a lot of effort into trying to lessen their dependence on any one market, as a result of which, as I said, exports to the UK have grown substantially.  Last year they grew by 12% but they have grown more quickly in other markets.  That has been a conscious effort by Enterprise Ireland working with these companies to help them to broaden their footprint and lessen their dependence on any one market.  However, the UK being our nearest neighbour and being English-speaking, is and will continue to be a very important market for Irish exporting companies.<\/p> <p>  One of the switches we will probably see in certain sectors, such as financial services, over the coming years is that rather than the UK being the first export market, exporters might look west.  Part of one of the things we are doing with some of these companies now is helping them to consider other markets as their first export markets, given the challenges in the financial services sector and market.  However, I would not describe it as a panic on Brexit.  What we are seeing is companies looking at the situation and responding to it as it evolves.  The short-term situation regarding exchange rates is an immediate matter for them to deal with and we are helping them to respond.  As I mentioned earlier, companies that have exports into multiple markets are better positioned than companies that have an awful lot of their export eggs in the UK market.  It is therefore different for different companies and sectors.  However, we do see exports as part of our next four-year plan and we do see exports to the UK growing, as opposed to declining.  It is just that we see and will be focused on trying to accelerate growth in other markets, so the relative dependence on the UK will decline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry"},{"type":"speech","time":1476806400,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>What are Enterprise Ireland's comments on CETA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#J00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>Our clients would welcome CETA.

We think CETA will open Canada up to being a far greater priority.  That is the state of client engagement with the market in the short term.  In the more medium term what will be interesting is what opportunities will arise regarding not only the European-Canadian trading relationship, but also what happens in Britain, which has a traditional trading relationship with Canada, and whether that would also open up opportunities for our clients.

In 2015, we had the best performance of our history.  We now have 187,000 FDI jobs in Ireland.  Last year alone, 213 investments were approved, the knock-on effect of which is quite interesting in that about 20% of all private sector jobs are related to FDI.

If there is any doubt about the serious threat that Brexit is for the business sector, one should hear the account from the mushroom industry, on which a debate is taking place in the D&aacute;il as we gather here.  The mushroom industry representatives made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine of which I am member and I can tell members there is no doubt about the impact of Brexit on this industry.  A significant number of jobs in that sector have been lost already because of devaluation of sterling.  There is no doubt about the threat of Brexit to businesses across the island.<\/p> <p>  In the InterTradeIreland presentation from Mr. Aidan Gough it was alarming that 97% of businesses had no plan ahead of the referendum vote and 92% had no plan in terms of this eventuality.  There was a widespread assumption that it would be a vote to remain in the EU, not one in favour of Brexit. <\/p> <p>  The other point that was worrying was that one in five firms plan to decrease the level of investment.  I would like to hear the witness comment on this.  I appreciate that for Enterprise Ireland, IDA have as many opportunities as threats in terms of bringing investment into the country, particularly competing with a number of multinationals that traditionally would have invested in Britain and is looking at bringing them to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In the presentation by Enterprise Ireland, they talk about looking at other export opportunities.  It is a much more positive presentation.  It does not really tally with the survey that InterTradeIreland has.  I want to get a sense of whether IDA understands the severity of this.<\/p> <p>  Second, in fairness to Enterprise Ireland, it acknowledges that a number of sectors are under threat - construction, engineering, agricultural machinery, timber, food, particularly the agri-food sector.  I assume Enterprise Ireland has detailed data on a county by county basis of companies and their level of exports to the North and to Britain.  What plan has Enterprise Ireland for the Border counties?  A very significant organisation that comments on economic matters in this State recently briefed Oireachtas Members that the North is in serious trouble in their opinion, that County Donegal is under threat and interestingly County Waterford is under threat because of its exposure to exports.  Waterford is heavily reliant on exports, which one would not have thought.<\/p> <p>  Is the data that Enterprise Ireland has informing its position of putting a focus on counties and sectors that are impacted by Brexit?  Is there a really focused evidence based approach to how Enterprise Ireland is dealing with this?<\/p> <p>  In terms of currency hedging, what is really worrying is that the advice we are getting is that the Bank of England will take the approach that for the foreseeable future it will look to boost trade from Britain so it will try to keep the currency low in order to assist that strategy.  That is not good news for us because currency hedging is based on swings and roundabouts.  If one is to have a permanent situation of equilibrium with the euro and pound sterling, that is very worrying.  One has heard contributions from certain sectors, saying that they are taking a 25% hit and they wish to speak to the companies to which they export next year, seeking 25% more.  I would appreciate feedback on my three questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#K01600","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1258,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  On the data analysis, we have looked very closely at it and I mentioned earlier that we had identified just short of 1,500 companies that are exporting to the UK and Northern Ireland, that those companies are the companies most immediately affected and that the impact is not uniform.  It depends on their level of exports; some sectors are more export oriented than others and have more of their eggs in that basket.  Those companies are clearly the most vulnerable companies and they tend to be in sectors where they have products or services that are not that easily transportable, such as construction products that do not necessarily transport very well to more distant markets.  We have that data and we have been talking to those companies on a one-to-one basis.  We have identified the companies that are most vulnerable, both in terms of sectors and the companies.  As I mentioned earlier it is not a one-size-fits-all.  Our response is tailored to the individual company.  As the exchange rate deteriorates from the point of view of the euro, with sterling weakening it makes the situation more difficult for those companies if they are not hedged through a financial institution or if they have no opportunity to undertake a natural hedge.  In some cases, our discussions with some of those companies are on reconsidering their supplier base and where they were importing some product from other parts of euro denominations, they may be looking at putting more of that natural hedge into sterling regions so that they can offset some of currency risk.  It is true that some companies are in a more difficult position than others because no matter what they do it takes time to make that switch.  We have been focusing on providing them with information and with connections.  We ran a webinar on hedging.  We have put companies in touch with financial institutions.  We have brought the main pillar banks into Enterprise Ireland to meet our board.<\/p><p>The main pillar banks have met our board.  We have talked and are continually exchanging information, without divulging confidential client information about their approaches and our approach, and the strategic importance of some of those sectors.  I certainly would not underplay the difficulties that some individual companies are facing.  We are working with them to help them address the short-term issue and competitiveness.  In the long term, some of those companies are considering other markets and other potential customers innovating and being able to position their product as a higher value added premium product.  Not all companies have that opportunity in the short term.  It is company specific.  We are working hard with those companies to try to help them with that response.<\/p><p> On 7 October, the currency breached the 90p mark.  Predictions are not certainty.  The volatility will continue.  Meanwhile, companies have to manage their businesses.  Other companies supplying into the UK market face the same situation.  UK companies face the same issue in respect of their supply base.  Switching suppliers is not easy, particularly for products that require approvals and standards on traceability.  That cannot happen overnight.  That fact alone gives companies some window of opportunity to make plans and moves.  We are working on a daily basis and as it changes we are responding to those changes.<\/p><p> Although it is cold comfort to companies, this is not the first time we have had that exchange rate.  It went close to parity in 2009.  We have to be able to respond.  In the areas where we can provide support such as competitiveness, innovation, market access and information, we are doing so.  Where we have the ability to provide funding for those activities, we are also doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#K01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1260,"content":"<p>Did the Senator want a specific mention of the mushroom sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1476806400,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>Two problems face the mushroom sector.

That would have been in areas such as technical testing, for example, where we felt that those services could be provided by commercial entities.  That included some activities where parties decided to undertake those services in a commercial capacity rather than for Enterprise Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the issue of personal taxation and Ireland's attractiveness as a location, I would point out that in addition to attracting companies from abroad, Ireland is also an important destination, as far as Enterprise Ireland is concerned, for entrepreneurs to relocate to and that is something that we have focused on increasingly over the last number of years.  In fact, about 15% of the new startups that we support are run by people who came here from outside of Ireland.  Last year for the first time we ran a competitive fund which was targeted at international entrepreneurs to try to get them to come to Ireland.  We had 86 or 87 applicants which we short-listed down to 20 and, of those, ten came to Ireland to establish their businesses.  We have had two such competitive calls this year, which were very successful.  Under the second call we will have some entrepreneurs coming to Ireland next month to compete for those funds.  We are seeing entrepreneurs coming to Ireland to establish new businesses and while personal taxation is, of course, one of the important factors, they are also coming here because of the availability of skills, the ease of doing business and the international access that Ireland can provide.  An important factor in terms of that access is the cost of infrastructure and this is one of the reasons for entrepreneurs increasingly choosing to locate their businesses outside of Dublin, given the pressure on housing resources and given the high costs - both personally and commercially - of doing business in the capital.  This is important for us in terms of promoting regional locations.<\/p><p>In terms of innovation, I will just mention here that there are national targets to double the level of business expenditure on research and development.  A very important factor in that regard is the availability of the infrastructure, technology centres and centres of expertise that have been built up around the country including in the medical technology area, biotechnology and a range of other areas.  One of the interesting aspects in regard to recent developments in terms of Brexit is that we have heard researchers in the UK are getting a bit concerned about the availability of, and access to, Horizon 2020 funding and it is one grouping that might be looking at where it should undertake its research.  If one of the implications of Brexit is limited access to Horizon 2020 European funding and collaborative research that could make Ireland a more attractive location for those leading edge researchers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2016101800002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Sherry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1476806400,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>If I could make an additional comment, there are certainly synergies or opportunities in the sectors that were mentioned to work together but there are also real opportunities for cross-Border co-operation and the development of genuine all-island clusters.
