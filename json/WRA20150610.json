Following the announcement some months ago, I myself travelled to Carrickmacross to discuss the issue with some of the workforce there and I am very conscious of the need to pursue replacement jobs in the area. <\/p><p>I established an interagency group to co-ordinate the response from the State in terms of awareness of entitlements and opportunities for the affected staff of the company and, secondly,  to pursue a replacement investor.  This group is chaired by Enterprise Ireland and includes representatives from IDA Ireland, the Local Enterprise Office, the Education and Training Boards from Cavan\/Monaghan and Louth\/Meath, and the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>Initially the main work of the group has been to co-ordinate the response from the State in terms of awareness of entitlements and opportunities for the affected staff. This has been done mainly by Department of Social Protection in terms of benefits and the Educational Training Boards (ETB)\/Local Enterprise Offices (LEO) in terms of courses and support for start-up businesses. <\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection has been very active in terms of meeting the staff in relation to that Department&rsquo;s services and the Educational Training Board are pursuing relevant courses and training.  Amongst the initiatives taken was that the Local Enterprise Office has facilitated several of the former staff of this company on a &lsquo;Start your Own Business&rsquo; Course which that Office organised recently.  <\/p><p>In relation to the second issue, finding a replacement industry for Carrickmacross, this remains a very high priority.  I have been in regular contact with the IDA to ensure that everything possible is being done to market the facility abroad through their global network of overseas offices.  I have also ensured that Enterprise Ireland is engaging with their existing client base of Irish-owned companies to pursue potential expansion opportunities into this plant.  The building itself and the skilled workforce there, are both strong selling points.  <\/p><p>The existing factory is not owned by the company, but has been leased from a private owner.  IDA is in discussions with relevant parties to explore what will be involved in ensuring that the facility can be available for a new investor.<\/p><p>More generally, IDA will continue to highlight the strengths of the Border and North East regions to potential investors, and Enterprise Ireland will seek to continue to develop expansion projects by Irish companies in the area.  However no specific new project has yet emerged. <\/p><p>Also, through the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015<\/i>and the development of new Regional Enterprise Strategies over the coming months, my Department and our Agencies will intensify efforts to sustain and accelerate job growth in the regions generally.  The Government&rsquo;s job creation policies are already achieving solid results.  The Border region, which includes County Monaghan, had an unemployment rate of 17.7% just two and a half years ago and this is now down to 10.2% according to the latest CSO data.  While still unacceptably high, this represents a very solid improvement and the National trend is steadily downwards as job creation improves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061000083#WRH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061000084#WRJ00250"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[22982\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061000084#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the cost of providing satellite imagery to his Department during the past four years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>My Department has incurred no costs in providing satellite imagery during the past four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061000084#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061000084#WRJ00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Data Programme","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061000084#WRJ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[22523\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061000084#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when Suckler Payments for 2014 will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This system has been facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre (LEC) with support from my Department. Whilst this administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to enrolments in the area, each school authority, in accordance with the Education Act, 1998, retains autonomy in relation to its own enrolment policy.<\/p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of this Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. Officials from my Department understand that a Section 29 appeal to the local ETB has been taken in respect of the student referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>Where a section 29 appeal to the ETB is unsuccessful the parent or guardian may take an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department within 42 days. Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on this Departments website at the following link<\/p><p>: by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, phone 0761 108588.<\/p><p>My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.<\/p><p>The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's area.

These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.<\/p><p>  The procedures outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy.  In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.<\/p><p>  The procedures also recognise the importance of good supervision and monitoring systems to prevent bullying and facilitate early intervention.  The school's anti-bullying policy must explicitly confirm that appropriate supervision and monitoring policies and practices are in place to both prevent and deal with bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>  In relation to reporting bullying behaviour, the procedures make clear that a pupil or parent my bring a bullying concern to any teacher in the school and individual teachers must take appropriate measures regarding reports of bullying behaviour in accordance with the school's anti-bullying policy.  The procedures require that all reports, including anonymous reports of bullying must be investigated and dealt with and that it should be made clear to all pupils that when they report incidents of bullying they are not considered to be telling tales but are behaving responsibly.<\/p><p>  The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils.  There is a requirement in the procedures for the school Principal to report regularly to the Board of Management in relation to the overall number of bullying cases and provide confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.<\/p><p>  The Board is also required, under the procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school.  Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.<\/p><p>  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.
