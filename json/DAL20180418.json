I do not have a monopoly on good ideas and I am happy to work closely with Deputy Kelleher, as I do with my other colleagues, in doing everything we can to create and sustain jobs and to support enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Companies Act 2014 is robust.  It is an important element in ensuring Ireland's regulatory environment is maintained to the highest standard.  All companies, regardless of size, are required to comply with the extensive provisions of the Companies Act 2014.<\/p><p>Moreover, company directors are obliged under common law to exercise fiduciary duties, which include the obligation to act with care, skill and diligence.  Alongside company law, companies must comply with a broad range of legal requirements on the treatment of employees and creditors, disclosure to Revenue and the protection of the environment etc.  Taken together, these regulations make up a wide-ranging legal framework for the conduct of business.<\/p> <p> The Companies Act 2014 introduced some changes that are relevant to the governance of all companies, both listed and not.  In particular, one of the key innovations of the Act is that directors' common law fiduciary duties are codified together with the diverse statutory duties and assembled into one place.  This makes the law more accessible and comprehensive for directors.<\/p> <p> The Act also introduced a new directors' compliance statement at section 225.  This places an onus on directors of affected companies to make a statement confirming that a company has policies in place to ensure it complies with \"relevant obligations\" and that they have conducted a review of the appropriateness of these policies or structures during the financial year.  The \"relevant obligations\" mean the company&rsquo;s obligations under tax law; and company law obligations, the breach of which would be a serious offence as defined.  Section 225 applies to all public limited companies and large private companies, that is, private companies where the balance sheet for the year exceeds &euro;12.5 million and the turnover for the year exceeds &euro;25 million.<\/p> <p> The Companies Act 2014 provides for remedies for breach of directors&rsquo; fiduciary duties.  In general, the company may sue for damages, seek an indemnity for losses or seek an account of profits.  In addition, there are circumstances provided for in the Act where a director can be made personally liable for the debts of the company.  Examples include reckless trading; fraudulent trading; failure to keep adequate accounting records; and acting in breach of a restriction or disqualification order.<\/p> <p> The Government is committed to ensuring that the Companies Act 2014 continues to deliver a robust yet competitive corporate regulatory framework for business in Ireland.  Consequently, the provisions of the Act are under continuous review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800003#A00500","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524044100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her kind words.

Funded by my Department, LEO Donegal plays a critical role in supporting micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases.<\/p><p>LEO Donegal has invested significantly in micro and small businesses by way of its core suite of supports since its establishment in 2014.  Between 2014 and 2017, LEO Donegal paid out over &euro;1.4 million in grant funding in respect of 121 projects.  Clients supported with grant funding have consistently added new jobs with 100 new jobs supported in 2017 and 621 in total over the past four years.  During this time, over 5,200 participants attended LEO training courses and 132 participants received mentoring.  Furthermore, 211 applicants from the county entered the Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur competition since it was launched in 2014.<\/p><p>I secured an additional &euro;4 million in capital funding for the 31 LEOs for 2017 to fund a range of LEO Brexit supports across the country, including Donegal.  This additional funding has been maintained for 2018.  These supports are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to cope better with the changing external environment, especially the impacts arising from Brexit.  The supports include grants to assist LEO clients in diversifying their markets, targeted training and mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges and opportunities as well as a Lean for Micro programme to help micro-enterprises to address competitive issues within their businesses by building the capability of their employees to identify problems and improve operations.<\/p><p>In May 2017, my Department with Enterprise Ireland launched the regional enterprise development fund, REDF, with funding of up to &euro;60 million.  The first call under this fund concluded last August with results announced on 11 December.  Three projects across the north east-north west secured funding under the first call, including Donegal Digital Innovation, which will involve the creation of an innovation ecosystem in Inishowen by delivering a three-year enterprise capacity-building programme based on the peninsula's location factors, high tech skillsets and applied research potential in traditional sectors.  The second call for projects under REDF opened for applications on Monday, 16 April.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House. <\/i><\/p><p>The LEOs can also assist businesses in accessing other Government supports, for example, business loans from Microfinance Ireland or trading online vouchers for businesses that want to improve their online sales. <\/p><p>The regional action plan for jobs, launched in the north east-north west in November 2015, is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create more jobs in rural areas including Donegal.  Under the plan, the aim is to increase employment in the region by 10% to 15% over the period to 2020 resulting in the delivery of 28,000 jobs.  A total of 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region from quarter one of 2015 to quarter two of 2017 representing good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs by 2020.<\/p><p>Finally, the action plan for rural development takes a whole-of-Government approach to the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  The plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Departments, State agencies and other bodies.  The plan seeks to support sustainable communities, support enterprise and employment, optimise our rural and recreation potential, foster culture and creativity and improve rural connectivity.

Small businesses are emerging from the recession but the problem they face is the lack of Government policies that actually support them.

Overall, I am confident that the sale will not only continue to ensure high quality production of current projects, but will also provide continued investment in the studio and employment opportunities for the skilled workers in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800008#F01200","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1524046500,"counter":65,"content":"<p>There are currently three people working full time in Ardmore because it is sitting empty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800008#F01300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1524046500,"counter":66,"content":"<p>That will improve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800008#F01400","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1524046500,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Meanwhile, in Dublin, there are three films being made, one in a derelict NAMA factory where, as I said, four workers have just been sacked because they protested about the conditions under which they were working.

The Government is committed to supporting job creation in the regions.  My Department and its agencies are working towards ambitious targets to ensure employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country.  This includes County Carlow which is marketed by IDA Ireland as part of the south-east region.  The employment situation in the south east which also covers Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and south Tipperary has been improving steadily in recent years.  Key to this has been the South-East Action Plan for Jobs which was launched in September 2015.  I met the people involved with the plan only last Monday.  The action plan places a heavy focus on employment growth, with a target of creating 25,000 extra positions for the area.  To date, 16,200 jobs have been created, which represents significant progress towards achieving the set target.  IDA Ireland client companies in the south east created 1,200 new jobs last year alone, which brought total employment in overseas companies in the region to 14,785 across 75 client companies.<\/p><p>Looking ahead, IDA Ireland will continue to work with its clients to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in the south east.  In doing so the agency will draw the attention of investors to the region's particular strengths which include the south east's accessibility, ports and existing cluster of medical technology firms.  The agency is also working closely with its existing clients in the region to help to strengthen and potentially grow their respective workforces.  In addition, the agency is investing in property solutions to drive the growth of foreign direct investment in the region.  IDA Ireland's &euro;150 million regional property programme includes the construction of nine new advance facilities throughout the country, one of which will be located in Carlow.  The building is at design stage, with the aim of having it completed in 2019.<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/font><\/i><\/p><p>While more work remains to be done in the wider south-east region, the overall employment trend in the area is positive.

There is potential in the south east for the new technological university, of which Institute of Technology, Carlow will be a key part.  The property solutions and advance facility to which the Minister referred need to come on stream at the earliest possible date.  We need facilities to cater for the graduates of the university in the future.  An advance facility was available to MSD when it came on site originally.

It will be the company's first stand-alone vaccines and biologics facility outside the USA.

While there are jobs at the lower end of the employment spectrum, facilities must be established in the area to replace what was provided in the past.  The promised advance facility would be key in finding replacements for these jobs.  It must come on stream soon to tie in with the prospective establishment of a technological university in the south east.  It is important that they come on stream at the same time.  I am disappointed that we are talking about the end of 2019 for the provision of the advance facility which initially was supposed to be in place at the end of 2018 .

The project is at design stage and it is aimed to complete it by quarter 2 of 2019.

The purpose of the Bill is to amend existing legislation to strengthen the PIAB operationally to ensure greater compliance with the PIAB process and encourage more claims to be settled through the PIAB model.  The board facilitates objective, fair and transparent assessments of damages in personal injury cases at a low delivery cost and in a timely non-adversarial manner in a far shorter timeframe than is possible through litigation, which often takes several years.  According to PIAB data, 33,114 new personal injury claims were submitted in 2017 compared to 34,056 in 2016.  PIAB processing costs were 6.2% of awards, which is a fraction of the cost had the claims been handled by way of litigation.<\/p><p>The average time taken to assess a personal injury claim was 7.3 months, compared to several years if litigation was involved.  In 2017 the average PIAB award was &euro;24,879, compared to a figure of &euro;24,305 in 2016.  Award values vary, depending on the nature and severity of cases received.  The figures demonstrate that the PIAB model continues to deliver major benefits by providing a low cost, quick and fair option in injury compensation cases.  The general scheme addresses issues highlighted in submissions made during the public consultation process held in 2014 by the then Minister on the operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 and 2007, in addition to issues highlighted in the report of the cost of insurance working group on the cost of motor insurance, published in January 2017, and the report on the rising costs of motor insurance published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The Bill is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is technical and complex legislation which requires careful consideration during drafting in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  It is hoped to have the drafting of the Bill completed in quarter two of 2018 and published thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800011#J01400","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1524048900,"counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800012#K00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1524048900,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, told the public affairs director of Heneghans PR firm two months before it was made public that he planned to refer the proposed takeover of Celtic Media by Independent News &amp;amp; Media to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

The guidelines provide for an initial phase one examination by departmental officials and referral to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for a more detailed phase two examination where this is warranted in the light of the initial diversity and plurality assessments and factors such as the scale of the proposed acquisition and its geographical reach.

The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, sought a full review of the proposed merger and a recommendation from the authority within 80 working days.  However, in June 2017, INM announced the takeover would not go ahead.  That was before the Minister would announce his decision on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland review.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reports today that the Minister told a lobbyist from INM in a telephone conversation of his intention to refer the takeover to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland because of &quot;the overall ownership of print and broadcast titles by Denis O'Brien&quot;.  This telephone call with a former Government press secretary, Mr. Eoghan &Oacute; Neachtain, now director of public affairs at Henaghan PR, occurred two months before the Minister acted.  It is an extraordinary revelation that the Minister provided key information to a lobbyist for INM considering he refused to engage with the NUJ on that very same issue.  In effect, it appears that the Minister might have prejudiced his statutory functions under the competition Acts in regard to approving media mergers.  He might also have unwittingly shared insider information that was passed on subsequently to a shareholder.  Unlawful disclosure of insider information is a criminal offence under Regulation 6 of the European Union (Market Abuse) Regulations 2016.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach said the Minister is going to make a personal statement.  This is not a personal matter.  It is not encompassed by the rules of the House on personal statements.  I ask that the Minister make a full statement on his departmental role and be subject to questions in the House this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800013#L01600","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1524049500,"counter":134,"content":"<p>It does not appear to me that this is sensitive information or confidential information.

Twice yesterday during Taoiseach's Questions, I asked questions in an attempt to interrogate these proposals because they are nothing more than another half-baked, futile exercise in closing the door after the horse has bolted.  They are pure tokenism, which will do nothing to address a housing and homelessness emergency that is spiralling out of control.  I hope I might get the answers today from the Taoiseach that I did not yesterday.<\/p><p>What is the point of bringing in legislation, even with criminal sanctions about which I am happy, which will limit rent increases to 4% annually when rents are unaffordable anyway and the level of rent is such that nobody on a low income or dependent on housing assistance payment, HAP, or even those on a reasonable income such as teachers, nurses and so on can afford them?  Average rents in parts of Dublin are &euro;1,800 per month.  In south Dublin, average rent is almost &euro;2,000 per month, which means someone needs &euro;24,000 a year to secure an average rental property.  That is impossible.  What will the Taoiseach do about that?  This is only if someone can secure accommodation at those rents given landlords will not even look at those on HAP.  I am dealing with constituents who have come to my office with lists of between 80 and 100 properties that they have viewed trying to find accommodation that they can afford but it is impossible.  All this leads directly to homelessness.  None of the loopholes relating to substantial refurbishment and moving relatives in for the sale of properties, which are being exploited by vulture funds and landlords, is being addressed.  Landlords are using them to evict people.  Nothing has been done about affordability.  Emergency legislation is needed.  Earlier this week, a scandal was revealed yet again.

There are few vacant rental properties because people will not pay these rents; the reverse is the case.  We do not have enough rental properties available for people to rent.  The legislation the Government has brought in is intended to contain the increases in rents in order that people do not face double digit or significant hikes if they live in rent pressure zones, RPZs.  According to the statistic produced by the Residential Tenancies Board most recently, average rents increased by just over 1% in the previous quarter.  Rents had been increasing at a high rate.  In 2016, for example, rents in Dublin increased by 8%.  However, the average increase was in the region of 5% for 2017, with an increase of 1.1% in the final quarter.

The Government fully accepts the four recommendations made by the Ombudsman.  We will implement them without further delay.  To date, some 700 women have received payments under the scheme, with enhanced health benefits and pensions.  Much good has been achieved through the restorative justice scheme.  We want to make sure the four issues raised by the Ombudsman will be dealt with.  The first is where there is a dispute about how long a woman spent in an institution.  We have appointed an independent senior counsel, Mary O'Toole, who has been asked to review all cases and make recommendations.  That will be done without unnecessary delay.  Her work will start immediately.  She will advise us on women who lack capacity due to dementia or other reasons, including being wards of court and unable to accept an award because of a lack of capacity.  We will also ensure women who were officially recorded as having been admitted to a training centre or an industrial school located in the same building attached to or located on the grounds of a laundry are included in the scheme.  We envisage having that work completed in the next three months.  We accept the Ombudsman's recommendation in that regard.  There is a difference of opinion between the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice and Equality as to whether this would involve altering or changing the scheme, but I do not think that really matters.

Some 16 years after the first report on sexual abuse and violence in Ireland was commissioned, we still do not have a proper answer from the Taoiseach, his Department or the Department of Justice and Equality as to when we will hear from the Department about a second sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report.  It is long overdue.  Over 30% of women reported to Women's Aid that they had found the Garda unhelpful.  Women's Aid clearly stated and showed statistically how the housing crisis was having a major impact on women and families in not being able to leave abusive and violent situations because they had nowhere to go.

The service plan adopted for this year provides funding for 50,500 people to receive home support.

The commission will be an independent body, organised on a similar basis to the Fiscal Advisory Council and will advise the Government on all sectors of economic infrastructure, defined as follows: energy, transport, water and waste water, drainage, sewerage, waste, flood risk management and digital communications.  The commission will also consider all of the interactions between infrastructure recommendations and housing supply. <\/p><p>In carrying out its role, the commission will produce a national infrastructure plan once every five years, setting out its assessment of long-term infrastructure needs over an ongoing 25 year period, with recommendations to the Government and the Oireachtas.  It will also produce specific studies on pressing infrastructure issues and challenges which will set by the Government and the Oireachtas, taking into the account the views of the infrastructure commission and stakeholders.  The commission will produce an annual monitoring report that will take stock of Government progress in areas where it has made commitments relating to infrastructure and relating to recommendations of the national infrastructure commission.  <\/p><p>This is a new way of doing capital planning.  It will take politics and politicisation out of capital planning and is based on a very successful model that currently operates in New Zealand.  I look forward to the discussions at pre-legislative and committee stages with a view to improving the Bill over the coming weeks and months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800018#Q00900","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1524052500,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800018#Q01000","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1524052500,"counter":277,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800018#Q01100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524052500,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524052500,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800018#Q01300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1524052500,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800018#Q01400","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524052500,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy","time":1524052500,"counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800018#Q01500"},{"type":"speech","time":1524052500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Order of the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, 17 April, we will now hear expressions of sympathy on the death of Mr. Peter Mathews, former Fine Gael member and Independent Deputy for the Dublin South constituency.  At the outset I want to welcome Mrs. Susan Mathews, widow of our late colleague, Deputy Mathews and their sons James, John and David, their daughter Maria who are in attendance today with their partners.  They are all very welcome to Leinster House.  As it is just over a year since the passing of Peter Mathews, it is appropriate that the House avails of this opportunity to pay tribute to him.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of his membership of the 31st D&aacute;il, I enjoyed many conversations - very long conversations, very often - on a great deal of issues with Peter.  In fact, the only thing longer than the conversations were the text messages that I got from him from time to time.  In all of those communications, he always mentioned his wife Susan.  In my mind, Peter was first and foremost, a family man.  As we all know, he was by no means a conventional politician, though his membership of the 31st D&aacute;il certainly enriched that assembly.  In his contributions and in his actions, whether addressing the consequences of the financial meltdown, the critical matter of corporate responsibility or any of the other important issues he raised, he consistently demonstrated the fact that he was a man of deeply-held convictions.  Decency, integrity and respect were hallmarks of the man.  He was brave, could never be accused of groupthink and was someone I will remember with great fondness and genuine respect.

I would also like to offer a very special welcome to Susan and his family members who are here today.  Peter was a true gentleman, a colleague and a friend and we miss his company and his counsel.  I first got to know Peter a few years before he entered this House as we were both regular panellists at that time on the \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\" show.  I quickly came to admire him for his courage, analytical ability and his ability to argue the issues without ever making it personal.  We often discussed things - everything from banking, the optimal design of swimming pools and, of course, medicine - in person and sometimes by phone.  Peter was a man after my own heart and very often those discussions were through detailed, long and regular text messages.  The Peter I remember is somebody who was very passionate, very determined and deeply caring about this country and its people.  While we did not see eye to eye on many issues, I always enjoyed being able to exchange views with him.  I have to say that I regretted that he had to leave Fine Gael over what was very much an issue of personal conscience for him.  That experience helped to convince me that we should not impose a whip on such issues again.  I believe that on issues on which people hold passionately differing views, debates can be conducted in a respectful way and in a way that is not personalised.  That was Peter's way and it should be our way too.<\/p>  <p>  He was fearless when it came to standing up for what he believed in.  I remember very well a heated occasion about three years ago when he was expelled from this Chamber by the Ceann Comhairle's forbear after he challenged the Order of Business and attempted to raise some genuine concerns about the banks and the pressure that people were under.  <\/p><p>As he left the Chamber, he was told to \"get a copy of the Standing Orders on the way out and read them for the afternoon\".  He replied confidently that he knew them already.  Peter was not grandstanding or playing to the Gallery on that occasion.  He was genuinely heartbroken about what some people were going through at the time.  He wanted to help.  Today, I am proud to honour Peter Mathews as someone who reminded us that politics is a noble profession.

Duine cneasta, l&aacute;ch agus mac&aacute;nta ab ea Peter.  D'oibrigh s&eacute; go dian d&iacute;cheallach, Domhnach is d&aacute;lach, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in ar son muintir a Dh&aacute;ilcheantar f&eacute;in ach freisin ar son muintir na t&iacute;re seo go forleathan.

He was a considerate and compassionate gentleman and a very diligent worker.  He was a man of great integrity and sincerity.  He showed unfailing courtesy in everything he did.  I often thought that Vincent Browne owed him a great debt.  Between 2008 and 2010, before Peter came into politics, he was a regular guest on \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\".  He became very well known due to his regular media appearances, during which he provided detailed and insightful analysis on economic and financial issues.  He was very well respected in his field.  He continued to play an analytical role during his time in politics.<\/p>  <p>  Peter Mathews was fearless.  He did not really worry what anybody thought of what he said or of his views.  Unlike many politicians, he did not try to calculate how his views would be interpreted by his constituents or others.  He had the intellectual self-confidence and capacity to take on anybody, even in the German Parliament or among the intelligentsia of the European elite.  He had confidence in his intellectual capacity to argue the point and make the case.<\/p>  <p>  When Peter was elected to the D&aacute;il on his first attempt in 2011, his then party, Fine Gael, took three seats in the Dublin South constituency.  I think it was the first time that had happened in a general election since 1982.  He was clearly determined to make his mark on Irish politics.  While he was honoured to represent the people of his constituency, he saw himself as a national representative at a time of crisis.  He wanted to bring his abilities and insights to bear on the national scene.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that for a time, Peter was quite the competitor during Taoiseach's Questions.  There is no doubt that if the card system which now exists had been in place during his period as a Deputy, he would have been in early to secure a card and get his say.  Peter's enthusiasm to participate was a source of challenge to your predecessor, a Cheann Chomhairle.  It was a challenge to accommodate him from time to time.  Indeed, there may have been a similar pattern at meetings of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.<\/p>  <p>  Peter Mathews was a principled man who was not afraid to stand up for what he believed in.  It is interesting to note that he was ahead of his time on conscience issues.  It is now becoming more acceptable to give people the freedom to pursue their personal positions, in accordance with their informed consciences, on issues like the termination of pregnancy.  As the Taoiseach has outlined, that is a legacy of Peter's contribution to this House.<\/p>  <p>  Peter was very sociable.  Even though he was independent-minded, people enjoyed meeting him.  He would occasionally visit the Fianna F&aacute;il offices on the fourth floor.  One Friday morning in 2014 - Deputies will be aware that there are very few parliamentarians around on a Friday morning - Peter engaged one of our researchers in a lengthy debate and discussion across a miasma of issues.  He had great time for everybody in the House, irrespective of his or her status.  I noticed his politeness and good manners to everyone in here, regardless of his or her position.  He charmed the staff in the canteen, for example.  He will be remembered as a very pleasant and kind man.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Peter was sadly struck by illness just before the 2016 general election.  His new independent status and the revision of the constituency boundaries in south Dublin would have made it a challenging election for him in any event.  It was a real test of his mettle, courage and resilience to take to the hustings when he was afflicted by a serious condition.  He met and easily passed that test.  He was not successful in the election itself, given the challenges I have outlined.  He was a unique politician who left his mark on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and across the nation over his five-year term in this House.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone in here shares fond memories of Peter.  We experienced his great intellect, his great analysis and his great commitment to Ireland.  I extend again my deepest sympathies to Peter's wife, Susan; to their four children, Maria, James, John and David; and to their extended family and friends.  I have absolutely no doubt they will remember their late husband and father with great pride and affection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800019#R00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1524053100,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son Sinn F&eacute;in, ba mhaith liom comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh le clann agus le cairde an iar-Theachta Peter Mathews, a fuair b&aacute;s an bhliain seo caite.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I want to extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family and friends of Peter Mathews, who sadly passed away in February 2017.  As has already been alluded to, Peter had a relatively short but eventful and colourful political career.  Of course it all started on &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;.  It is unquestionably the case that Vincent Browne met his match in Peter Mathews, and perhaps <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p><p>Peter Mathews had a colourful career in national politics.  He served the people of the Dublin South constituency with honour and commitment.  As we know, before Peter was elected to this House he had a long and distinguished career in business and finance.  While there were many things that Peter and I would debate and disagree on, we also shared an enormous amount of common ground.  He was not just a very learned and intellectually gifted man; he remained a very curious person and was always open to having a debate.  Sometimes, a Cheann Comhairle, he was willing to have the debate at length.<\/p><p>Peter was always in good humour.  I always enjoyed speaking to him.  Above all, he was a very kind person.  He would be the first to extend condolences, solidarity or good wishes to colleagues as the circumstances dictated.  I was the recipient of such kindness from him.  He regularly quoted Susan, who was like the oracle advising him from afar.  He was not slow to tell us that she sometimes chastised him as well.<\/p><p>The last time I met Peter was the Christmas just before he died.  He bore his illness with considerable dignity.  Although he was unwell, he remained defiant, determined and unrepentant in his strongly held views on the need for reform in Irish politics and the need for people outside the sometimes claustrophobic political circle to have a say and an influence.  It is with great sadness at the passing of Peter Mathews that I join everybody here in extending our sympathies and condolences to his family.  For his wife, Susan; his sons, James, John and David; and his daughter, Maria, he was a person of whom they are quite rightly very proud.

His views were fully and very carefully formed on every significant issue that we encountered in a most turbulent period during his membership of the House.  He certainly was not shy in promulgating those formed views with Ministers, colleagues, his own electorate and the general public through the media.  A chartered accountant by profession, he had plenty of advice to give, particularly during the period of the economic crisis.<\/p> <p> Many times - I cannot recall the number because there were so many - during my period as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I had the privilege of engaging with Peter on fiscal policy, the implications of our monetary strategy and what we should do differently and better.  Not only did he engage me in that fashion but he also engaged with officials of the Department in which I worked, as well as the Minister for Finance and his officials.  He brought those views to the Bundestag where he argued them trenchantly.  On more than one occasion, with quite strong vigour, he sought access to the bilateral discussions between the Government and the troika because he felt he had a unique view to bring to bear in his analysis of what needed to be done, not only from an Irish but also from a European perspective.  One had to be respectful of his views on all of these matters.  I recall being here for the graveyard shift when we had sittings on a Friday and there were very few Members about.  I was having a sandwich in the canteen and Peter felt he had a captive audience.  It was a long luncheon and took some time to eat the sandwich, but I certainly left that encounter much better briefed on a range of issues than when it began.<\/p> <p> At all times in all of those interactions he was a man of extreme courtesy.  He was what used to be described as a gentleman.  There are probably fewer people in these Houses about which such phrases can now be used, but they could be used with absolute certainty about Peter.  He had innate respect and courtesy with which he promulgated very strong views and that always struck people.  His views were made known with strength but never with rancour.<\/p> <p> As others said, his illness ended his career and life prematurely.  On behalf of my party and all those who were privileged to interact with Peter in his five years in this House, I extend my profound condolences to Susan, whom he loved passionately and deeply, as well as his family and friends.

I pay tribute to him as a public representative, a Deputy and somebody I got to know quite well in my time here.  I had heard about Peter Mathews before I met him.  I remember receiving a telephone call before either of us was elected when I was told there was a fellow called Peter Mathews who had some really good ideas that I would like about what was going on with the banks and the bailout.  I was told that many of those ideas would chime with my own.  I saw him once or twice on the Vincent Browne television show.  I was surprised in a way when I saw him pop up as a candidate for Fine Gael, as he was certainly not somebody who was toeing the Fine Gael line.  I say this without making a partisan or political point.  He was absolutely committed to putting across things as he saw them and with a particular passion about the banking crisis, the bailout and the costs he saw being inflicted on the people of the country.  That fed into a particular passion about the housing crisis and the impact he saw as directly connected to the policies on the bank bailout.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the fact that he came from a very different part of the political spectrum, we had many discussions and conversations.  We were on the finance committee together and, as Deputy Brendan Howlin mentioned, we travelled to the Bundestag.

On one occasion I had a chat with him when Susan was in the car.  He was travelling to the west and referred constantly to Susan beside him.  His love and passion for her and the family were self-evident.  <\/p>  <p>  Peter was completely non-partisan in his desire to debate issues, regardless of where one was on the political spectrum.  It was a regular occurrence for him to send a text message after a Member had made a speech stating \"well done\".  He wanted to discuss it and analyse the ideas in it afterwards.  That is an unusual type of politics and politician; he was somebody who did not feel constrained by party allegiance and was willing to debate and disagree with people on all sides, including in his own party.  I radically disagreed with him on some matters, most notably on the issue that led him to leave Fine Gael - abortion.  I have no doubt that we would now be debating very robustly our different views if he was here.  As said by others, his views were always genuinely held.  He was driven by conviction and a decent and honourable human being.  He is a loss to this House but much more to his family.  I again offer my deepest sympathy to Susan and his family.

That was a new one on me.  I am amused that the Taoiseach was receiving the long text messages along with the rest of us.  I do not know how he found time to do so many things as the text messages were so long.  It was mad, but they were always very interesting.  We had many discussions about NAMA and both agreed that it was a horror scene.  His experience in the banking world meant that much of the time he knew where the bodies were buried.  It gave him great insight and he understood the gentlemen about whom we were talking better than most of us here.<\/p>  <p>  There is a lot we could say about Peter.

I am delighted on behalf of the Rural Independent Group to be able to pay tribute to an t-iar-Theachta Peter Mathews, a man of principle above anything else.  He was principled to his fingertips.  He was quiet but determined.  Above all, he was respectful of all sides and of all people.  He died aged 65, unfortunately.  He had fought a brave battle even during the election.<\/p>  <p>  Peter was elected as a Fine Gael Deputy in the 2011 general election for the Dublin South constituency.  His constituents meant so much to him.  He met and listened to so many families who had been horribly affected by the banking collapse and he was deeply passionate about helping them make some headway.  The number of times he stood up on the Order of Business has been mentioned and he was intent on raising it every other day with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, because he was so disturbed by the banking situation.  Indeed, the legacy remains today.  I do not know how many times he went down to Ballyhay.  I can say to my shame that I never went down but he travelled there on several Sunday mornings.  He knew what the construct of National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was and he did not like it.  He knew there had to be other ways.  He always maintained his dignity when he was meeting people about that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I travelled to the United States with him and there was not be a finer person to be with.  He was a qualified chartered accountant who worked for companies such as Coopers and Lybrand, now PwC, and the ICC Bank.  He knew what we did not know.  We were here talking about a monstrosity of a situation but Peter understood it.  To be fair, very few people listened to him in here but he knew it.  It was in his being.  He was educated, smart, straight and above all honest.<\/p>  <p>  He was deeply concerned with issues of conscience.  It hurt him greatly to have been expelled from his party for voting with his conscience, having made up his mind on those issues.<\/p>  <p>  He cared passionately about Susan and his four children.  Any time we were in company with him, he always talked about them fondly and proudly.  Some had gone to Australia and different places.  He was passionate about and proud of them at all times.<\/p>  <p>  He was always interested in doing good and would not countenance anything critical.  He could have fun in banter.  I remember I had an intern working for me who was from a foreign land.  She invited us to her house and five or six of us agreed to go.  She invited us for a meal and it took several hours.  We had plenty of time to talk about her own traditions.  Peter made a commitment to go and he honoured that.  We had a wonderful night.  To be in his company at any time was refreshing and inspiring.  He is a huge loss to his family.  It is nearly a year since he passed away.  They miss his advice, his care and his wisdom.<\/p>  <p>  I hate to bring this up but I was horrified when he succumbed to illness and awful things were said on Facebook and social media.  We must deal with that because there is no place for that in any democracy.  He was a decent man.  I was horrified that the Minister, Deputy Madigan, was going to share a platform last week with one of the people who said those things.  We have to think of our colleagues, of respect, of dignity and of the family, and be proud.  If he was here today, he would be overwhelming in his campaign to retain the eighth amendment.

We had been to the same school and had done the same course in university.  However, like many people here I got to know him during the financial crash.  It feels like a bit of a therapy session.  I refer to the numbers Peter had.  When it came to the financial crash and managing it, he was passionate - there are no two ways to describe it.  He would engage in conversation at length.  We heard about this earlier on.  I remember one particular occasion - I cannot remember what the issue was, but my wife was with me - when Peter's argument was along the following lines: Gonzaga boy to Gonzaga boy, I plead with you not to do some something or other.  My wife looked at us and said it was a long time since either of us was a boy.  He had that boyishness, uplifting, optimistic and engaged way.  He was a relic of old decency and a gentleman.  However, with it was passion.<\/p>  <p>  I was beaten by Peter in Dublin South in the 2011 general election.  In a number of different ways, it was not a bad experience.

They think it is different from rural Ireland but it is not.  Just as they say down the country that they are waiting to open up the Mullinahone box to see what happens, it is pretty similar in Dublin Bay South in the sense that we vote in tribes.  We are tribes.  The Mathews's are a tribe.  Mount Merrion is a tribe.  That tribe swung to victory that time and it was good to see because there is a recognition in the closed community world that the Mathews tribe have that decency and the same boyishness and uplifting character.  There would be the same enjoyable conversation and one would come away from it richer for the experience.  It is a real loss that he is not involved in Irish public life and a far greater loss for his family.  It is lovely that we remember him and them today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800021#T00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524054300,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to talk about Peter Mathews.  I only found out about a half hour ago that these statements were happening today and I am glad I am in a position to say something.  I met Peter Mathews back in 2011 when I joined Fine Gael.  He was at my first constituency meeting.  I should say I saw him first at the count, which, if I remember correctly, was in the basketball arena in Tallaght.  I have a visual memory of him standing and surveying all the count from the top of the hall.  It is a memory I will always have.  It was my second time meeting him.  I could not believe that he pronounced my name correctly.  He said &quot;Hello, Josepha&quot;.  I asked him, &quot;How did you get my name right?&quot;.  That was Peter.  He had wonderful attention to detail and he was wonderfully personable.  When we used to go to our constituency meetings, apart from talking about economic matters, which he did so well, he would also give us book lists because he was a bibliophile.  I always took down the books that he recommended because he was so well read and so well briefed on current affairs and everything that was going on around him.<\/p><p>He was also very kind to me when both my sister and my father died from cancer.  He sent me beautiful mass cards that he got in Jerusalem and he texted me and rang me.  I went to Peter's funeral and met Susan and his family and it was such a fitting funeral for a man of such deep faith.  I really respect that and his integrity.  The <i>Oxford English Dictionary<\/i>defines a man of honour as a man who adheres to a high standard of conduct, and Peter did that.  He was a hard worker.  I loved his sartorial style, his elegance and his fizzling, engaging personality.  I know his death is an absolutely devastating loss to Susan, Maria, James, John and David.  I can only imagine what they are going through.  They have my utmost sympathy.  He was well loved, not just by the whole of Dublin Rathdown but also in Mount Merrion where I live and where Peter lived.  He will never be forgotten, certainly by me.  Other speakers talked about his kindness, which was absolutely the case.

I first met him outside the Mansion House in 2010 or early 2011 at the launch of the Fine Gael candidates.  I remember it well because Peter, as many, including the Taoiseach, said, spent a lot of time on the &quot;Vincent Browne Show&quot;.  I had watched him and he gave me a few tips and pointers.  I was seven years a councillor at that stage.  Peter had no experience in public life but he nonetheless had his views and made them well known.  I remember quite a lot of his advice, which turned out to be completely accurate.  Like so many, he sent an awful lot of text messages.  One of the things I remember fondly was the snippets from the <i>Financial Times<\/i>that he used to photocopy, or rather Colm from his office would photocopy, and he would hand them out to various people at parliamentary party meetings, on the corridor or wherever one might bump into him.<\/p><p>More often than not they were referencing the financial crisis and all the other issues that we were beset with at the time.<\/p> <p> My fondest memory of Peter, one I want to put on the record, is from the Fine Gael parliamentary party think-in back in Mayo in 2012.  We were set an unofficial challenge, which we all took up nonetheless.  It was to go up Croagh Patrick at the end of our think-in.  Off we set on what was a beautiful day.  Peter was in khaki pants, a short-sleeved T-shirt and a summer hat.  I remember it well because I have a photograph from the day in my office.  Off he took up Croagh Patrick with the rest of us.  Of course I was more sensibly dressed in jeans and desert boots.  There was a big group of us.  Peter paired off with the then Deputy and now Senator Joe O'Reilly.  More illustrious members ran up and then ran down.  They have no names but we all know Eoghan well.  We got to the top.  On our way down we met Peter and Joe.  They were still on their way and still determined.  The weather was closing in with mist, rain and all manner of different horrible weather that the Atlantic can throw at people.  We got down to the car park.  I think we might have had a beverage or two in the local pub.  We were ferried back to Westport.<\/p> <p> Then we were all sitting at dinner.  I remember it distinctly.  There was a little disquiet because Peter and Joe were still up the mountain.  We were concerned, so much so that all of the Ministers and members stayed at the table.  Deputy Patrick O'Donovan and I decided that we had better go back and check on them because they were not answering their telephones.  I was concerned to think of Peter and Joe up the mountain on their own in the weather and the dark.  Anyway, Patrick and I got to the car park at the foot of the reek.  Off we went up to try to find them.  Out in the distance we could hear voices.  Lo and behold there was Peter and Joe coming down to the car park.  I said to them that they had not answered their telephones and that we were getting worried.  They said they were okay.  At the time Peter would have been 60 years of age and Joe was 56 or 57.  Peter turned to me and said he was getting a little worried about Joe because he was getting on a bit.  Anyway, he survived and we all survived.<\/p> <p> It is a great testament to the man he was that we remember him so well not only in these corridors or in Mount Merrion, as Deputy Ryan and the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, mentioned but everywhere.  He was a great man and our memories are testament to that for his family.  May he rest in peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800021#T00400","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524054900,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Let us stand for a moment's reflection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800022#U00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524054900,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Members rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed)","time":1524054900,"counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800022#U00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1524054900,"counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800022#U00400"},{"type":"question","time":1524054900,"counter":307,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[13845\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800022#U00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet committee E (health) last met; and when it will next meet.

As the Taoiseach is aware, this is a major important burning issue for all the people of the south east.  The campaign continues for a second catheterization laboratory and for 24-7 cardiac care to be based at University Hospital Waterford.  Unfortunately, another incident occurred in recent weeks that underscored again the absolute and essential need for improvement in cardiac care and intervention facilities in the south east.<\/p><p>I am aware that everyone has focused on the national review that is ongoing.

It was reported by Susan Mitchell in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>at the weekend that 650 of the 4,373 medical consultants in the State are not on the specialist register.  Those are 2015 figures.  Those figures show that one in seven consultants employed in private and public hospitals in the State have not completed their specialist training.

Since the start of the year there have been two significant developments to address the trolley crisis, the publication of the bed capacity review and the passing of a Sinn F&eacute;in motion proposing solutions to this crisis and yet we have had no action to support these matters.

St. Vincent's Hospital ran out of trolleys this week.  People had to be accommodated on seats because they could not even get a trolley.  That is how bad it is.  We have 502,482 people on outpatient waiting lists.  I will give the Taoiseach an example of what this means.  I know of one lady who needs a knee operation.  She will have to wait a year and a half for her operation and she cannot work as a result of needing the operation.  She is employed but cannot work.  She will be dependent on social welfare for a year and a half.  How many of the more than 500,000 people on outpatient waiting lists are also costing the State social welfare expenditure in addition to they not being able to get urgently needed treatment because of these waiting lists?<\/p>  <p>  Are there any radical plans to deal with this?  I point to the issues that are being screamed at the Taoiseach.  If we are going to open the beds we need, we must pay the nurses if we are to recruit the number of nurses that are necessary.  That means giving the pay equality for which nurses have been asking.  Tara Nic Chormaic's letter, which I quoted a few times this week, referred to the pay issue and the housing issue.

People can be in the accident and emergency department for two, three or four days and they tend to be predominantly elderly people in their late eighties or early nineties.

A consultant made the point to me earlier this year that almost four weeks of elective surgeries have been cancelled in 2018 alone.  He and I had that discussion prior to St. Patrick's Day.  That consultant said that in the first two weeks in January there was the closure of elective surgeries to ensure there was proper capacity in place to deal with the 'flu epidemic immediately after Christmas.  We had another closure of elective surgeries during the snow event and there were other closures of elective surgeries when the crisis hit in early February.  Four weeks of elective surgeries have been cancelled.  The cancellation of those patients' surgeries is adding to the overcrowded lists.  There does not seem to be any recognition of the logjam that has created across the system.

Human resources management within the health service is very poor.  There is severe, consistent and sustained overcrowding now in accident and emergency departments.  Waiting lists both for outpatient and inpatient services are very long in terms of the time people are waiting.  There is a sense that the Government does not have a handle on health policy or the health service, notwithstanding the number of times the Cabinet committee on health meets.  Nine months ago, the Taoiseach promised an urgent and comprehensive Government reply to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, and money was assigned to the strategic communications unit at the time to market whatever the response to that was going to be.  Why is the delay continuing?  There is a growing belief within the health service and system that the Taoiseach is delaying committing to a strategy so that implementation does not actually happen or does not have to start until next year.  When will the comprehensive implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report commence?  For when is it scheduled?<\/p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach explain the reason members of Government are tripping all over the place to announce building projects which might start in ten years time but refuse to make themselves available on days when waiting lists are published?  While this is an approach which first appeared in 2015, can he honestly stand over a situation where officials are sent out to answer on bad news days but Ministers elbow them aside when they believe there is something positive to sell?<\/p>  <p>  Regarding health projects generally, I have asked on a number of occasions about the origins of the specific list of projects.

That whole story illustrates a dysfunction at the heart of how we operate our health service.  People who were on the clinical trial for many years were taken off the medication last year.  Two people died when they came off the medication.  As a response to that, 19 were put back on the medication.  It is incomprehensible to me that if a country hosts a clinical trial in accordance with clinicians working in our tertiary hospital and in accordance with a company's responsibilities, it is unthinkable and incomprehensible that the patients would be left to drift and taken off the medication without any due consequence of it.

I am not sure whether they are new or long-standing appointments.  I am around long enough to remember when the specialist register was put in place.  It might have been about 15 years ago; therefore, it is possible that some of the consultants are people who were appointed to their positions before the specialist register was created, but that may not be the case.  They may also be new consultants and, in some cases, they might potentially be temporary.  They might be locums filling posts.  Obviously, it is better to have somebody filling a post on a locum basis than to have nobody, although obviously it is not ideal that such a person would not be on the specialist register.<\/p>  <p>  On the overcrowding in emergency departments, the HSE records 345 patients as being on trolleys this morning, but obviously that number falls throughout the day and will be substantially lower by now.

Often, when one sees these facts - they are facts - they jar with what one hears in the media and commentary, but they are facts over which I can stand.<\/p>  <p>  To give a small example, on overcrowding in two hospitals - Beaumont Hospital and in Mayo - there was no one on a trolley this morning awaiting admission to a bed.  In others there was none on a trolley for more than eight hours, including in Wexford, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Cavan and Kerry.  Meanwhile, at the other end of the table, there were over 30 patients on trolleys in Tallaght, the Mater Hospital, Sligo and Galway.  One can see the huge variations from hospital to hospital.  A couple of years ago Beaumont Hospital used to top the league table when it came to overcrowding, but now it is regularly at the bottom, with the bottom being the good place to be, needless to say.  It has some additional beds, but it was a lot more than that that helped to improve the position.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty we so often have in the health service is that, while there are pockets of best practice and good management, it has been a struggle to mainstream them and make best practice the norm across the health service.  That would make a huge difference in patient care and might even save money, or at least achieve for us better value for money.<\/p>  <p>  Nurse recruitment is going reasonably well.  I do not know the exact figures, but I think there are about 900 more nurses employed by the health service than there would have been a year or so ago.  As I explained, that has enabled us to open additional hospital beds, including more than 200 additional acute beds in the past six months.  In part, it is probably down to pay restoration.  It may also in part be down to Brexit, with fewer nurses migrating to the United Kingdom.  The fall in the value of sterling has probably also had some effect.  However, there are certainly issues with retention.  There is a high turnover of staff for lots of reasons, including terms and conditions and the pressure and stress staff are under.  That issue is being examined by the Public Service Pay Commission to see how we can improve retention.<\/p>  <p>  We have 1,509 people waiting for knee operations, but the waiting list is starting to trend downwards largely because of the additional resources provided for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  Of the 1,509, 1,200 are waiting less than nine months; therefore, the median waiting time for a knee operation is about nine months.  I do not know the particular case to which the Deputy referred, but certainly most people are having the operation carried out in a shorter period.  About 430 have been waiting less than three months; 416 have been waiting between three and six months, while 336 have been waiting between six and nine months.  I hope that, as we continue to do the work we are doing with the NTPF, the lady in question will have her operation carried out, I hope sooner than she expects or has been advised of.<\/p>  <p>  On Sl&aacute;intecare, I discussed the draft implementation plan with the Minister and his team on Monday and also with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and his team.  We had a good look at it and I expect it to come before the Cabinet in the next couple of weeks.  I argue that, even though we do not yet have an implementation plan, implementation has started.  There is a lead executive being recruited and they should be appointed within weeks.  The implementation office for Sl&aacute;intecare is being established in the Department of Health.  Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir has been appointed to head up the group, as recommended by the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, to examine taking private practice out of public hospitals, what it would cost, how it might be done and what the impact would be.<\/p>  <p>  We are expanding access to GP care.  Deputies will know that the legislation is pending to extend GP visit cards to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit and change the income limits for people with disabilities in line with what was recommended in the Make Work Pay report.  There are other measures to extend free GP care.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommends that we extend it to an extra 500,000 people per year.  I think the Government has come to the conclusion that that would be too fast, that we would not have the capacity in general practice to add that many people every year, but we do intend to settle on a figure by which we will increase the number with access to free GP care every year.<\/p>  <p>  We have also begun the process of reducing prescription charges, both for those who have medical cards and those who do not under the drugs payment scheme.  Again, that was a recommendation made in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Also, the capacity review has been undertaken and we have begun its implementation.  I have mentioned the beds that are being put in place.<\/p>  <p>  On Respreeza, I share the Deputy's concerns.  It is normal practice, when something is on trial or provided for patients on a trial basis - even if the HSE decides not to approve it as a reimbursable treatment - for those patients who have been on it and benefiting from it to stay on it.  What happened with Respreeza was not what has happened with other medicines of this nature.  I will certainly keep a very close watching brief on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800024#W00700","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1524056100,"counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800024#W00800"},{"type":"question","time":1524056100,"counter":327,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[13847\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800024#W00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet committee F, national security, will next meet; and when it last met.

On Saturday, the United States, Britain and France launched airstrikes there, which all reasonable and right-thinking people will find abhorrent, just as they would find abhorrent the use of chemical weapons by anybody.  Such intervention is wrong and has represented a very significant escalation of tension in the region.  The intensification of the military conflict is not a credible way to save Syrian lives.  The deployment of more western forces in Syria or any further bombing will not bring an end to or shorten the conflict in any way.  The international community has to be consistent in its application of international law and policy in which peace and protecting civilian life has to be the absolute priority.  That holds for Syria, Palestine and all other conflict areas.  There has to be a political solution.  What we need to see in Syria is a lasting ceasefire and a political process to bring about the end of conflict.  That is what the Government and all Governments should be seeking to do.  Will the Taoiseach make this point and raise the issue with his counterparts in the US, Britain and France?  Will he raise it at an EU and UN level?<\/p>  <p>  On 27 March, the Taoiseach took the decision to expel a Russian diplomat based on British military intelligence.  Only three days after he took that decision, 750 innocent Palestinian protestors were wounded by Israeli soldiers at a peaceful planned march in Gaza.  Fifteen civilians were killed.  Over the two weeks which followed, that death toll reached 31, with more than 1,000 injured, yet not one Israeli diplomat was challenged, much less expelled.  Why the double standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800025#X00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1524056700,"counter":343,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach will be aware that since the Cabinet security committee last met, there appears to be a sustained cyberattack under way directed specifically against countries that have recently imposed sanctions against Russia.

While there are parties here who seem to believe that Russia is an innocent bystander which has, at the very worst, been forced to behave like this, the majority are deeply concerned about what is going on.  It is noteworthy that the Russian Government has acknowledged the behaviour of the cyberattack group, which was recently subject to US sanctions, though of course it also claims to have known nothing about its work.  As I said before, a series of our national risk assessments have identified cyberattacks as potentially the most damaging risk to Ireland.  The response has been highly complacent with no real sense of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach happy that the systems are in place to identify quickly any such attacks against our critical IT infrastructure and that we have in place the expertise to protect ourselves in such cases?

I do not think it is necessarily or naturally the case that just because other countries have it, we should have it too.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of Syria, the Government unequivocally condemns the use of chemical weapons and biological weapons by anyone anywhere in the world.  What we see in Syria is a conflict going on for seven or eight years that has caused enormous distress and hardship for people in Syria.  It has caused a humanitarian crisis.  It also caused the refugee crisis which has impacted on other countries.  Syria was a middle income country with a relatively high standard of living.  It is very sad to see a country go so far backwards so quickly.  I have had the opportunity to meet some of the Syrians who have come to live in Ireland as part of the refugee programme and to hear a little bit about their lives.<\/p><p>I met some of them when they came to the airport at Baldonnel a few weeks ago with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee.  When one talks to them it makes any problems one has pale into insignificance.  We very much condemn the abuse of human rights and the denial of democracy by the Assad regime in Syria.  We understand that the UK-US-France action was targeted at chemical facilities and that prior warning was given, as a result of which there were no civilian casualties.  Ireland was not consulted about the operation in advance and our approval was neither sought nor given.  We stand by the EU statement, agreed by foreign Ministers this week, that there is no military solution to the conflict in Syria.  The intervention by outside powers, whether European powers, America, Iran, Turkey or Russia, will not bring this conflict to an end.  What is required is a ceasefire and a peace process.  We support that and are willing to assist in any way we can.  We have troops with UNDOF in the Golan Heights, which is on Syrian territory, and in south Lebanon, so the Irish Government has an interest in the region.  We want to support any peace process that might take place.  Deputies will be aware that the current structure of the United Nations, which gives Russia and other countries veto powers, means the UN is largely paralysed in the context of acting in Syria, and that is a real difficulty.<\/p> <p> I assure Deputies that we regularly challenge the Israeli Government and its diplomats about the occupation of Palestinian territories.  The difference between what happened as regards the protests in Israel and Palestine and what happened in Salisbury is that the latter was an attack on EU soil and the violation of the sovereignty of an EU state.<\/p> <p> I am happy with where we stand in respect of cyber attacks at the moment, though there is always room for improvement.  I recently met the head of the National Cyber Security Centre, which is based in UCD and which we have been building up for a number of years.  It is doing a good job in monitoring the situation and in preventing attacks, but it is having some difficulty recruiting specialists with the skills that are needed in this area.  We will need to beef it up in the years ahead because cyber attacks will be a feature of security in years to come.  The WannaCry attack did a lot of damage to the NHS but did not do a lot of damage to the IT systems in the HSE because it was more prepared to deal with the attacks than the NHS.  That is not often the case but it was the case on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800025#X01300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1524057300,"counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800026#Y00200"},{"type":"question","time":1524057300,"counter":355,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[15156\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800026#Y00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he has held recent meetings with church leaders and faith communities.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1524057300,"counter":356,"content":"<p>On 31 August last, I held a formal meeting under the structured dialogue process with representatives of the Catholic Church, led by Archbishop Eamon Martin.

Given the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it is worth remembering the statements of the late Pope John Paul II when he attacked sectarianism during his visit in 1979.  In Drogheda, he said to the illegitimate armies who were then waging war, \"On my knees I beg you to turn away from the path of violence and return to the ways of peace.\"  That was a very important moment in building trust between religions in the fight for peace and it was a key dynamic in the victory of democracy and the ultimate end of violence, although it took a long while for a number of men of violence to heed his words.  In this spirit, I hope our Government will seek to ensure that there is space in the Pope's itinerary to reaffirm the anti-sectarian sentiments with which he is so strongly associated and to encourage the work of different faith leaders here on this very point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800026#Y00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1524057300,"counter":360,"content":"<p>The structured dialogue with churches and faith communities is arranged and organised by civil servants.<\/p><p>It is something that my forebearer as Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, did also.

I attended some of the meetings as a Minister and I decided I would continue with the practice when I became Taoiseach.  I have no doubt that previous taoisigh, including Mr. Bertie Ahern, saw value in it also.  We generally meet in round-table format, with many Ministers around the table and many representatives from the church.  The latter are mostly clergymen but also include laity.  On some issues, we agree to disagree, such as on the eighth amendment.  Obviously, the Catholic Church gave us a very clear position on that.  We agreed to disagree on it.  The Protestant churches had diverse opinions.  Some of them were open to removing the eighth amendment from our Constitution but were not well disposed towards the Government's legislative proposals, for example.  Each church will make its own statement on that in due course, if it has not done so already.  We have agreed to follow up on a few issues on a bilateral basis.  We agreed to follow up on some of the education issues with the faith communities and the Department of Education and Skills.  I envisage meeting each of the major faith groups once per year in round-table format, with bilateral discussions happening in the interim at ministerial level.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the papal visit, the primary focus will be to attend the World Meeting of Families.  The Pope will attend the Festival of Families event in Croke Park and will be the chief celebrant at a mass in the Phoenix Park, which will include the World Meeting of Families.  The programme will also include those elements that are normal for the visit of a Head of State &mdash; for example, a brief engagement with the Taoiseach and the President.  In addition, there will be a number of Church-related projects.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, the full programme details outlining where the Pope will visit have not yet been confirmed.  The State's involvement, as appropriate regarding an official visit by a Head of State, will be similar to its involvement in previous high-profile visits to Ireland, such as that of Queen Elizabeth of England.  In particular, it will support those events where the public will be in attendance in large number, taking on board all the health and safety requirements in addition to the security measures to which such a visit gives rise.  The costs associated with the visit will be similar to those of previous official visits by a Head of State.  The visit must be seen in terms of its historic nature - the first in 40 years by a pontiff - and in terms of the opportunities it presents as regards announcing Ireland's visibility and international reputation.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the programme for the papal visit, I am very much aware that this is primarily a pastoral visit.  I do not believe it is the role of the Government to tell Pope Francis what he should or should not do, whom he should or should not meet, or what he should or should not visit.  We have said, however, that we would like to facilitate, if possible, a visit to Northern Ireland.  We suggest it would be appropriate to meet some of the victims and survivors of clerical abuse or abuse by State and Church authorities.  In addition, we have expressed our view as a Government that families should be respected and seen in their diversity.  There are families of all different shapes and forms, whether they include children being brought up by grandparents, same-sex couples with children, or lone-parent families.  We have expressed our view as a State that this is how we see the family.  That view has been put across to the Church authorities.  Having said that, however, we fully respect the separation between church and state.  Religious freedom applies to this also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800027#Z00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524057900,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of D\u00e1il","time":1524057900,"counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800027#Z00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1524057900,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, to issue a statement regarding the Order of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800027#Z00800","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1524057900,"counter":370,"content":"<p>It is proposed, notwithstanding the Order of Business of the D&aacute;il of yesterday, 17 April 2018, that immediately following the taking of the Topical Issue Debate today, No. 26a, a statement by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, shall be taken.

It is obvious to everybody that the implications of what is going on in respect of the operations of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and the proposed takeover by Independent News &amp;amp; Media, INM, are huge and will probably mean that in the long run there will be a serious outcome for the State and the Government.  This is not just down to an individual, whether he or she is on the side of corporate media or a Minister in the Government, it is also reflective of a culture in which the State and corporate bodies work for, and in protection, of each other.  This should emerge from the current investigations.  Rather than just the detailed finger wagging at each individual incident, it is important that the investigations expose to the people and the body politic what many instinctively know, that the wealthy and powerful who hold huge influence, particularly in media circles, get favourable treatment from the State, not just from the current Administration but also from previous Administrations and many people in the body politic in general.

At the time I was referring to the significant concerns about what could only be considered as the hacking of emails, which potentially compromised huge numbers of journalists and their sources, and had major implications in terms of damage to the independence of media and the protection of journalism.  However, I cannot ignore the most obvious escalating development, the involvement of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in this issue.  On 6 December 2016, in reply to a priority question, he told me that he had only commenced the phase one assessment of the takeover on 24 November 2016, that his officials had not yet made any decision and that he had 30 days in which to make a decision on three options, one of which was potential referral to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  He stated: \"I have not received the report from my officials yet.\"  The Director of Corporate Enforcement's affidavit states a month earlier, on the afternoon of 11 November, the Minister personally told a representative of Heneghan PR that he would refer the proposed merger to the BAI based on the advice of his officials.  Heneghan PR which is headed by Nigel Heneghan is an adviser to Leslie Buckley and spokesman for INM and a member of the BAI's compliance committee.  A PR firm employed by INM with close ties to all of the main protagonists in INM made direct contact with a Minister and was made privy to a decision, about which I as a parliamentarian was told weeks later had yet not been made.  The repercussions are stunning, not least in respect of the implications for potential market manipulation and insider dealing but also the questions it raises about corporate governance within INM and the axis of power between major shareholders of INM and the Minister's Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800028#GG00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1524058500,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I echo the Taoiseach's remarks about the importance of a free media in a functioning, healthy democracy.

The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was established under the 1988 Data Protection Act.  The commissioner holds the responsibility for upholding the rights of individuals, as set out in the Data Protection Acts, and also for enforcing the obligations that arise from the legislation on data controllers.  While the commissioner is appointed by the Government, she is independent at all times in the exercise of her functions.  Individuals who feel their rights are being infringed can complain to the commissioner who will investigate the matter and take whatever steps may be necessary to arrive at a resolution.  The commissioner has statutory powers to undertake investigations into complaints from individuals and enforce compliance with data protection requirements.  The office also conducts on-site inspections arid audits of data protection in both public and private sector organisations<\/p>  <p>  The Data Protection Bill 2018 is before the Oireachtas, with Second Stage being debated in the House this week.  The purpose of the Bill is to give further effect to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, in areas in which the regulation gives member states a margin of flexibility and to transpose the accompanying law enforcement directive into national law.  It will take effect on 25 May.  The legislation will strengthen the independence, structures, functions and powers of the data protection commission.  The new EU legal framework confers significant responsibilities for the protection of personal data on both data controllers and data processors.<\/p>  <p>  In her most recent annual report the Data Protection Commissioner outlines that a total of 2,795 valid data security breaches were recorded by her office last year, representing an increase of almost 26% on the numbers of breaches reported during the previous year.  The GDPR provides for mandatory reporting of personal data breaches to data protection authorities, unless a breach is unlikely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals.  The controller must report such data breaches without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it.  The report must identify the likely consequences of the breach and the measures taken, or to be taken, to mitigate adverse effects for individuals.  Under the GDPR and the new legislation, public and private enforcement of data protection is set to increase.  The scope of compensation claims arising from infringements of data protection rules will also increase, resulting in higher levels of private enforcement activity. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation and seek the co-operation of Members in passing it.

I have already stated that these are issues that are under investigation from a number of sources, in particular the Data Protection Commissioner.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I respect the independence of the Data Protection Commissioner.  I assure the House that the Government of which I am a member has steadily increased the resources allocated to the Data Protection Commissioner.  Funding has increased to approximately &euro;11.7 million for this year, up from less than &euro;2 million in 2014.  This additional funding has facilitated the recruitment of additional staff, both legal and technical, and experts of an investigative nature.

It is important to understand that proposals for legislation respond to evolving jurisprudence in this country and across the European Union.

This is not a matter of opposition to the metro.  However, the current proposals would see Na Fianna GAA Club, which has 3,000 members, moved off its grounds for up to seven years.  That would be catastrophic for the club.  It cannot be allowed to happen.  An alternative must be found.  Na Fianna is not only a GAA facility but it is used widely by local schools and the community, as is normal with clubs of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  The current proposals make no sense.

There will be 25 stations in total, 15 of which will be brand new.  A large proportion of the route will be underground, including where it passes under the important city centre area and Dublin Airport.

I also wish to thank Deputy Ellis for his suggestion.  I suggest that he submit his points to the ongoing consultation process.  There is a temptation for Deputies to make suggestions to me but such suggestions should be made to the National Transport Authority, NTA.  However, there is an opportunity to make such suggestions in the House and there is no doubt that the NTA will be aware of what Deputy Ellis has stated in the House as well as his direct submission.<\/p> <p> The MetroLink project can bring many benefits.  I am confident that the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, through the consultative process that is under way, will find a way of delivering the MetroLink project and maintaining good routes that interchange with other public transport in a way that respects the social, community and sporting life of our city.  The NTA has committed to work collaboratively with Na Fianna to address the concerns identified and develop mitigating proposals for discussion within three to four weeks of the consultation deadline.  That attitude and willingness to talk and consult and find a better solution if there is one will apply to all other parties concerned.  As the Deputies are now aware, the proposed route is not set in stone and it would be wrong if it were.<\/p> <p> It is predicted that capacity for 15,000 passengers per direction per hour during the busiest peak times will be required along the corridor I have addressed.  MetroLink will have the capacity for 30 trains per hour in each direction and will greatly enhance the public transport offering in Dublin.  The creation of about 4,000 jobs during construction is also envisaged, which is significant for the economy in the region.  The NTA, in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TIl, recently launched the public consultation to which I have referred on the emerging preferred route.  It is appropriate that we continue to refer to it as the emerging preferred route.  It is a proposal which has been identified as the likely optimal scheme from a technical design perspective but without the benefit of public consultation and input.  It is not a finalised and selected scheme.  The final layout will only be determined after consideration and evaluation of the issues raised during the consultation process, including the representations made by Deputies McDonald and Ellis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800029#HH00800","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524059700,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

It does not make sense.  When I met the NTA and other parties at the recent consultation, I immediately raised the concern that using these grounds was going to be a non-runner.

It consists of two planning layers, the first being a comprehensive network covering all European regions and accounting for 5% of the funding available.  The second and most important part is the core network, consisting of the most important connections within the comprehensive network, linking the most important nodes and accounting for 80% of funding available.  The remaining 15% is reserved for projects of common interest.  To complete the TEN-T core network corridors by 2030 will require approximately &euro;750 billion.  However, the north west is precluded from applying for that funding.<\/p>  <p>  The key issue is that to qualify as a core network and receive core funding, an area had to have both a road and rail link.  Information I have received shows that in 2011 the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, who was then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, purposely removed key transport projects in the north west from Ireland&rsquo;s application to the European Union&rsquo;s Ten-T funding programme and effectively wiped the north west off the core map.<\/p><p>The western rail corridor was removed from the core network map by the then Minister, now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  That relegated the western arc, the road running from Cork to Derry, to the comprehensive funding box because without the rail link, the road network could not qualify for core funding.  Remarkably, when the western rail corridor was taken off the map, Shannon Foynes Port was added and the rail link between Limerick and Foynes was put in in order that Shannon Foynes Port could qualify for core funding.  The Navan to Dublin rail link was also included.  It is clear, therefore, that there was money for some projects but not for all.  The effect of removing the western rail corridor and relegating the western arc road to the comprehensive funding box meant that key transport infrastructural projects in the north west were also precluded from receiving funding up to 2030.  That affected Galway Port, Ireland West Airport Knock, Killybegs Port and Sligo Airport in applying for core funding under the TEN-T programme.  It is hard to believe all this happened on the watch of a Mayo Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and a Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, who was a Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport at the time.<\/p> <p> The projects had been included by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government prior to leaving office in 2011.  The western rail corridor which was to extend into Claremorris, County Mayo had been completed from Limerick to Galway and was to be extended to County Mayo in two phases.  Ballina is the busiest freight location in the country and it beggars belief that the line was not prioritised, given the hugely positive economic impact it would have had on the county and the region.  The maps initiated by Fianna F&aacute;il when in government which included the north west and County Mayo were redrawn by Fine Gael and the then Minister, now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in 2011 and prioritised road, rail, port and airport infrastructure for Dublin, Cork and Limerick, with a link to Belfast, while everything north of Limerick - the entire north-west region - was excluded.  There really are few words to describe the devastating impact that has had on the region's economic development.  Remarkably, at the time the then Fine Gael MEP for the north west, Jim Higgins, warned his colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that it could close off the projects to future EU funding for good.  It is a warning the now Taoiseach chose to ignore.<\/p> <p> The western economic arc, the road from Cork to Derry, is still included on the comprehensive funding map which only accounts for 5% of funding, but if one looks at Ireland 2040 - it was called the fantastic plan - that was launched by the Government, the road is not mentioned.  How does the Minister explain this?  Where is the Government's commitment to this road network?  It seems that all we are getting is a small section upgraded around Collooney in County Sligo.  Perhaps we should be satisfied with the small crumbs we in the north west get from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800030#JJ00500","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":408,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I commend the Deputy for raising this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800031#KK00200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":409,"content":"<p>There is no point of order during a Topical Issue debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800031#KK00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Just one second-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800031#KK00400","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":411,"content":"<p>No.  There is no point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800031#KK00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I sat at the table with the Minister when the programme for Government was being agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800031#KK00600","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800031#KK00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":414,"content":"<p>The first thing that was agreed to was that the west would be included in the submission for TEN-T funding.

It comprises the comprehensive network and a subset called the core network.  The core network is required to be completed by 2030.  It is the most strategic part of this European transport network, with the objective of TEN-T being to address the most strategic aspects of the comprehensive network with the highest European added value, in particular cross-border sections, missing links, multimodal connecting points and major bottlenecks.  The network builds on existing and planned infrastructure in EU member states and was identified on the basis of the European Union's planning methodology which has to comply with common requirements or standards.  Ireland's agreed core TEN-T network runs from Belfast to Dublin to Cork and includes the core ports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes.  The proposal for the TEN-T network included technical specifications which must be achieved by member states within specified timeframes.  That had to be taken into account in considering the draft network in 2011.  For example, the proposed specifications at the time included a requirement for full electrification of all railways on the proposed core network.  In fact, it was only when, during the subsequent EU co-decision process, Ireland obtained an exemption from the need to roll out ERTMS - a European wide telematics control system for rail traffic - and electrification on its rail network.<\/p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of a very difficult economic climate in 2011, Ireland was required to consider the specific implications of the proposed network for its transport infrastructure, as well as our financial capacity to complete the technical specifications of our portion of the network within the timeframes proposed, namely, 2030 for our core network and 2050 for our comprehensive network.  Inclusion of transport routes in the TEN-T network could potentially allow projects on those routes to be part-funded by the European Union.  However, that could only be done through competitive EU-wide processes which were expected to be and were and continue to be considerably over-subscribed.  The majority of costs of any capital project being funded by the Exchequer would still be borne by the Exchequer, with just the potential, if applications were successful, of a minority of grant funding coming from EU sources.  All projects would also require accompanying cost-benefit analyses to be approved by the European Commission.<\/p>  <p>  It was in that context that Ireland, like other EU member states, liaised with the European Commission on its views on the appropriateness of the draft TEN-T network in line with the proposed methodology and the affordability of completion of the network at the time.  That resulted in sections of the proposed network not ultimately being included in the final TEN-T maps agreed to by all member states in 2013.  Despite the economic challenges the country has faced, priority has been placed on access to and within the north west.  The most notable demonstration of this is the Gort to Tuam motorway, the largest transport investment completed anywhere in the country since 2011.  That priority is further maintained in the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040.  Project Ireland 2040 places a strong emphasis on further improving connectivity, including the development of the strategic Cork to Limerick road link.  There will be a review of implementation of the core network by the end of 2023.  The Commission will consult member states and evaluate progress made in implementation of the TEN-T regulation, as well as the impact of evolving traffic patterns and relevant developments in infrastructure investment plans.  The regulation further sets out that the Commission, in consultation with EU member states, will evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows and national investment planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800031#KK01200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for repeating the wholly inadequate response he gave me in reply to a parliamentary question.

We now know that to be false because the then MEP, Brian Crowley, wrote to the EU Transport Commissioner at the time and her response was that member states retained \"substantial sovereign rights\" to decide on projects.  The second excuse is that we did not have the money, that we had to cut projects and that we had to provide matching funding.  Again, that is false.  I direct the Minister to Decision No. 1692\/96\/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 July 1996 which stated: \"These projects shall form a common objective, the implementation of which depends on their degree of maturity and the availability of financial resources, without prejudging the financial commitment of a Member State or the Community\".  It is there in black and white.  The Minister did not need to have the money in the bank to make the application.  To date, no Government representative has explained why Fine Gael redrew the maps when it took over in government in 2011; why the north west was wiped off the map and the western rail corridor was taken off it.  The Minister said the rail network had to be electrified.  Once he realised that was not the case, did he go back to the European Union and ask for the western rail corridor to be included and if not, why not?

As we had the opportunity to speak about this issue at length yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, I will be brief today.  <\/p>  <p>  The school was declared structurally unsound in 2004, but it is still in place, in all of its glory, with more than double the numbers.  There are only two toilet cubicles for 207 boys; there is no staff room; the prefabs are damp; the heating system is erratic and there is no gym.  I commend the staff, principal and school community for the wonderful work they do.  The principal, Mr. Brian Bergin, gave a great account of the excellent school community, but it is incredibly frustrated.  Can the Minister say whether the process of acquiring a site has been finalised?  A site has been on the horizon for the past 15 years.  Can he say when the design element will be finalised?  The people of Monasterevin are being served very well by the principal and staff of St. Paul's, but, sadly, they are not being served well by the State.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Minister announced the provision of 16 new second level schools, but Kildare South, despite having been on the 2015 list, was left off the new list, which is incredible.  The figures supplied by the Department do not stack up.  There is no political will on the part of the Fine Gael Government to deliver a new second level school in south Kildare, despite the figures that have been provided.  South Kildare is the fastest growing region in the country.  Between 2011 and 2016, the population of the area grew at 143% of the growth rate for the State.  In the south Kildare Educate Together report sent to the Minister last August it was noted that in seven years there would be more than 400 students without a school place, but the Minister does not see this as a problem.  I understand numbers come into it, but yesterday at the aforementioned committee meeting officials told members that the Department was seeking to provide 1,250 extra places in existing schools to meet the demand.  Surely, the answer to the problem is to provide a new second level school in south Kildare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800032#LL02300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060900,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to raise this very important issue on the floor of the House.  Last week's announcement by the Department of 16 new second level schools was met by real disappointment in Kildare South.  An Educate Together campaign has highlighted concerns about future capacity at second level in Kildare South.  The campaign has been running for the past four years, but there is obviously a belief within the Department that proposed extensions and a new build at St. Paul's in Monasterevin will suffice in addressing increased demand.  However, many people in south Kildare disagree with the Department.  What nobody disagrees on is that there will be increased future demand in County Kildare.  The disagreements centre on the level of that demand, where it will be and how it should be met.  It is important that we move quickly to deal with the matter.  Following last week's announcement, the focus must be on expediting the proposed extensions as quickly as possible and the new build at St. Paul's in Monasterevin which has been delayed for far too long.  It is only then that we will be able to determine whether we can meet the need for second level places in the area and, as I hope, push for a new school down the line.<\/p>  <p>  A new school building for St. Paul's in Monasterevin is even more critical than this time last week.  We spent hours with departmental officials yesterday at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills going through the history of this case which I have highlighted with the Minister on previous occasions.  We spoke about the conditions students and staff had to endure, the history of the case, from the explosion in 2000 when prefabs were provided, inclusion in the 2005 building list and the fact that the Department and Kildare County Council had worked together in sorting out a site which had hit an awful lot of problems.  Site selection is something which will have to be reviewed.  <\/p>  <p>  According to the Department's profile, construction will start in quarter three of 2019, but the design team for St. Paul's is confident that the project could be ready for construction by quarter one of 2019, a good six months earlier.  Six months is a long time in the context of the school year.  Departmental officials said there would be no delay in that regard.  I urge the Minister to ensure every effort will be made to see construction starting at the beginning rather than the end of next year.  I also ask him to ensure the plan submitted by the design team last week will be turned around by the Department by the end of this month, if possible.  I know that such a turnaround normally takes eight to 12 weeks, but priority must be given to St. Paul's and the delivery of the extensions at Cross and Passion College in Kilcullen, Athy community college, Patrician secondary school in Newbridge and the 500 spaces at St. Conleth's community college that are being constructed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800032#LL02400","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060900,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  I can understand their concerns.  I assure Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin that decisions on the location of schools are not political.  Such decisions are not made by Ministers but by the Department.  Every one of the 314 planning areas is treated in the same fashion.  Areas are evaluated fairly against the demographic profiles available which are based on existing child benefit payments, school enrolments and local authority plans for housing developments.  Decisions are based on the best available information and every area is treated equally.<\/p>  <p>  There are five schools that have projects in the Department's plan for the next six years and that forms the background to the assessment of needs that has occurred.  I can understand the Deputies' concerns about St. Paul's in Monasterevin and know that the Ceann Comhairle shares them.  It has been in the six-year programme and is currently at stage 2b, detailed design stage, where the planning applications, fire certificates, disability access certificates and so on are provided.  The design team submitted its completed stage 2b report on 10 April and it is envisaged that the review of same will be completed by the end of April.  In February the Department wrote to the school and the design team to give them an outline of the projected timeframe because it was acutely aware of the concern that the project should be subject to no further delays.  It outlined that the pre-qualification element normally took eight to 12 weeks and explained the steps required to ensure the school would be a near zero energy building.  This will be followed by progression to the tender stage which normally takes between seven and eight months.  The Department has projected that construction will commence in the third quarter of 2019.  In response to Deputy Martin Heydon's query, I can confirm that if the design team can deliver the project to proceed to construction at an earlier time, the Department will re-profile accordingly.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department is in the process of acquiring a site at Moore Abbey, Monasterevin.  Agreement in principle was achieved in April 2013, but the vendor insisted on full planning permission being obtained prior to the sale being completed.  Full planning permission was secured in July 2017 and the current state of play is that the Chief State Solicitor's office is working with the landowners' legal representative with a view to concluding the conveyancing.  The Department is absolutely committed to completion of the school.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards the project at St. Conleth's community college in Newbridge, builders are on site and student intake is due to being in September.<\/p><p>The Athy College project has been devolved to Kildare-Wicklow Education and Training Board.  The delivery of that building project will increase the capacity at the school by 600 pupils, with a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000.  The Cross and Passion secondary school in Kilcullen is progressing.  A technical site visit has been undertaken at that site.  The delivery of this project will increase the capacity at the school by 200 pupil places.  It is at project brief stage.  The project at Patrician College in Newbridge is also at project brief stage.  A site visit to the school has been undertaken.  The Department will be in contact with that school in this regard.  When the project is complete, it will provide capacity for approximately 900 students.  It is against that background that I understand the Department has assessed that 1,700 additional school places are planned to be delivered as I have set out.  The Department expects that there will also be some growth in the Kildare town planning area.  It anticipates that it will be possible to meet the level of demand there by extending the capacity of existing provision.  These assessments are kept under continuous review by the planning section of my Department.  That is the basis on which the decision was made by the Department.  Obviously, the data on which that decision was based is objective and assembled from independent sources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800032#LL02500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524061500,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  While I welcome the delivery of school accommodation in Newbridge, Kilcullen and Athy, I am confused about why south Kildare was on the list in 2015 but not on the list in 2018.  Is there a suggestion that the political will which existed three years ago is now gone?  Given that the population of County Kildare is growing exponentially, I cannot understand why it has gone backwards on the list.  County Galway was included in the 2015 review and is included in the new-build list.  Can the Minister provide figures that illustrate why County Galway was chosen and County Kildare was not chosen?  We had a long conversation with the officials about the geographic information system yesterday.  I certainly believe it is outdated.  It is not as accurate as one would hope.  While I am pleased to hear that the Minister will continue to review the position in south Kildare, I would like to hear the rationale for the decision not to include it.  The provision of ASD units is a particular issue.  We have 64 such units at primary level but just 18 at secondary level.  I do not see where provision for additional ASD units has been included in the current plans.  The position at St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin must be addressed with absolute urgency because the staff and students are operating in a difficult and challenging educational environment.

I particularly welcome his important clarification that if the design team for St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin can deliver a new school building more quickly, the Department will roll with that.  His confirmation that the school will be contacted on its latest design submission by the end of April is absolutely crucial too.  The matter of choice is a very important one in this respect.  People in the south Kildare area want increased choice of educational provision.  That was the predominant factor that led to the Educate Together campaign.  I know there have been discussions between the Educate Together movement at national level and the school authorities at St. Conleth's Community College in Newbridge.  I ask the Department to look at that because there are people who want increased choice to be provided in the south Kildare area.  I welcome the decision of the patron of Brannockstown primary school, which has closed, to divest the school.  I have been involved with the committee of Save the School Brannockstown.  There is an opportunity for more choice in the provision of primary education in Brannockstown.  It is a real possibility for the broader community there.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a substantial increase in the population of south Kildare over the last couple of decades.  The population of the county has increased by over 100,000.  As the Government's Rebuilding Ireland policy takes hold, building sites are opening up.  The increase in the number of planning permissions being granted is going to lead to further demographic pressures.  We disagree with the Department's decision not to grant a new school in south Kildare, as announced last week.  We will continue to ask the Department to ensure the ongoing analysis that has been mentioned by the Minister is expedited so that the proposed extensions that are needed at Patrician College in Newbridge, St. Conleth's community college in Newbridge, Cross and Passion College in Kilcullen and Athy community college are delivered as soon as possible.  Each of these projects would provide the additional ASD classes that are badly needed in the south Kildare area.  Even if these projects go ahead, the Department needs to keep an open mind regarding the provision of a new school.  I believe such a school will be needed down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800033#MM00300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1524061500,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputies' frustration.  Approximately 30 planning areas, from a total of 314 such areas, have been approved for new schools.  In some cases, the need is being met by programmes that are already under way.  In the area we are discussing, five school projects are already under way.  In other cases, the need is being met through the potential expansion of existing schools.  As the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy O'Loughlin has had access to the officials who advise me on these matters.  I think they have made themselves available to assure her of how they are applying these rules.  People can criticise the rules.  I understand why people put the rules under scrutiny when decisions that are unfavourable to them are made.  I assure the House that they are applied even-handedly and fairly across all areas.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Heydon has said, we factor additional ASD units into our school programmes and they are being factored into these plans.  Over recent years, we have more than doubled the number of ASD units at second level.  The number of such units is growing more quickly than the number of such units at primary level.  That reflects the success we are having in enabling students to continue on to second level.  I assure the Deputies that I regard educational provision in south Kildare as extremely important.

The titles that were to be included in the deal were <i>The Anglo-Celt<\/i>, <i>The Meath Chronicle<\/i>, <i>Forum<\/i>, the <i>Westmeath Examiner<\/i>, the <i>Westmeath Independent<\/i>, <i>The Connaught Telegraph<\/i>, and the <i>Offaly Independent<\/i>.  On 3 September 2016, after the public announcement by INM, the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, issued a statement calling on me, as Minister for communications, to investigate the implications of the proposed acquisition.  According to Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley of the NUJ:<\/p><blockquote>In approving the acquisition the minister is required to consider the issues of media diversity and plurality.  This is the first time these powers can be used by the minister, in addition to the powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/blockquote><p>In a further statement on 5 September 2016, Mr. Dooley called on me as Minister &quot;to set up a panel of experts to investigate the acquisition and to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to carry out a fully statutory inquiry, as provided for in guidelines&quot;.  He argued that in light of &quot;INM's dominant position in the national newspaper sector and the dominant role of the chief shareholder in the independent broadcasting sector there are compelling reasons for an investigation into the full implications of this proposed acquisition&quot;.<\/p><p>On 26 October, Deputy Brian Stanley said in this House that &quot;the media landscape [was] on the verge of losing more diversity owing to the possible purchase of Celtic Media Group by Independent News &amp;amp; Media which is controlled or owned by Mr. Denis O'Brien&quot;.  He also raised media concentration concerns on foot of a European Parliament report, compiled by Lynn Boylan, MEP, which found that Ireland had one of the most concentrated media markets in any democracy.  On 10 November, the NUJ said in a statement that I as Minister had power &quot;to examine every aspect of the proposed acquisition&quot; and urged me &quot;to display political leadership and courage&quot;.  It went on to say: &quot;failure to do so would represent an act of political cowardice, something we have experienced many times when it comes to challenging media interests&quot;.<\/p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, which sets out the powers of the Minister with regard to media mergers, states: &quot;the undesirability of allowing any one undertaking to hold significant interests&quot;.  The guidelines define &quot;significant interests&quot; as interests in excess of 20% within a sector, or across different sectors of the media business in the State.<\/p><p>Independent News and Media, INM, publishes the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, the <i>Herald<\/i>, <i>The Sunday World<\/i>and the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>, and it has a 50% stake in the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>.  Communicorp Group Limited, which is owned by the same shareholder, controls Newstalk, Today FM, 98FM, Spin 1038 and Spin South West, and this was approximately 20% of the entire market.  The Minister, in making his initial assessment, must have regard to the relevant criteria provided for in the Act and the guidelines on media mergers, among other matters.<br\/><br\/>The Independent News and Media decision to purchase a further seven regional titles with a significant online presence was always likely to lead to a phase 2 assessment.  I would have failed in my responsibilities under the law if I did not do so and I would have been criticised in the House for not doing it.  I have not seen the contents of the affidavit referred to in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, nor am I aware of its specific contents other than the manner in which it is dealt with in the article.  As this is a matter that is before the courts I cannot comment on the affidavit itself.  However, I confirm that I received a phone call from Mr. Eoghan &Oacute; Neachtain, former press secretary to a number of Governments, on 10 or 11 November 2016 informing me that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission had approved the Independent News and Media acquisition of the Celtic Media Group.  This was in advance of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission communicating the decision to me.<br\/><br\/>It was common knowledge that this was a very significant acquisition with a significant geographical impact.  I expressed a purely personal view that the likely course of action would be a referral to a phase 2 assessment in accordance with the guidelines in light of the diversity and media plurality assessments required and in light of the scale of the proposed acquisition, its geographical concentration and the extent of ownership of regional media by Independent News and Media at that point.  According to advice from the Office of the Attorney General, in the context of there being a decision by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the legislation about such referrals to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is clear that referral is an option to me as Minister when there is a planned media merger.  If this is so, there is nothing wrong or inappropriate with me as Minister saying to anyone or to the public that if the plan for the merger continued I would take advice on sending it to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  This is not inside information but simply a reflection of the legislation.  I had no inside information to give.<br\/><br\/>It may have been preferable if the conversation had not taken place but I was by no means expressing a definitive view, nor could I do so at that time.  Nor did I state that the view expressed was a confidential one as the article seems to assert.  I clearly stated that I had made all previous decisions solely based on the advice provided to me by my officials and I reiterated that I would adhere to that approach in this case as well.<br\/><br\/>There seems to be a misunderstanding about the nature of the media merger process.  It is not a secret process.  Guidelines on the process are publicly available on my Department's website.  The same guidelines were subject to a detailed public consultation prior to their finalisation.  Prior to the phase one decision I answered six parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il on the acquisition and was, for example, exhorted by the National Union of Journalists and certain political parties to use all powers available to me to examine all aspects of the acquisition.  The mergers process went through the full rigour required by the Act and the guidelines after it was received by me on 21 November 2016 and a recommendation was made by my officials on 4 January 2017 that the acquisition be referred to a phase 2 examination.  This was approved by me on 10 January 2017.  The vast majority of the documentation has been on my Department's website since last July but I would be very happy for any Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to come to my Department and view the full file on this merger as I have acted to the letter of the law throughout this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800033#MM01300","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524062100,"counter":467,"content":"<p>We will now have a question and answer process, with one minute for a question and one minute for an answer.

I will cite a few examples to give a picture of how large a problem it is this country is facing.  Sarah, a student from Dublin, stated:<\/p><blockquote>We were basically told we should wait until marriage to have sex.  To emphasise this point, the teacher took a piece of sellotape, stuck it to her hand, ripped it off and showed us the bits of dirt now stuck to it.<br \/><br \/>She likened this piece of tape to each girl, and her sticking the tape down to her skin as each boy the girl kissed.  She kept repeating this action, basically showing us that kissing many boys made you very dirty.<br \/><br \/>When the tape lost its stickiness, she proudly used this as an example of how we became emotionally unable to &quot;stick&quot; to one person if we keep &quot;kissing all these different boys&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>Niamh stated: &quot;I vividly remember the teacher referring to contraception as &quot;the C-word&quot;.  She didn't like saying it in the classroom as it was against the ethos of the school.&quot;  Eoin in Cork explained that a teacher briefly listed forms of contraception and noted that these did not always work.  She told him and his classmates that they should abstain until they were willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood.  No mention was made of homosexuality.  I could go on and fill a 20-minute slot with the responses that we received.  They are not isolated examples, as demonstrated by recently published research by NUI Galway on smart consent.  While it made a number of findings, the headline figure was that 76% of students believed their school sex education left out a great deal of important information.<\/p><p>The truth is that sex education in Ireland is in the dark ages.  We are behind the sex education introduced in Sweden in 1942.  In 2018, we have sex education where LGBTQ+ people are often not mentioned, contraception is barely referenced, the notion of a need for positive, enthusiastic consent does not feature at all, and there is a contrast between what is taught to boys and what is taught to girls.  The sexist so-called gatekeeper model is taught, with girls warned about sexual activity and boys taught nothing about consent.<\/p><p>The reason for this is contained in the importance given to the notion of religious ethos, which informs much of the relationship and sexuality education, RSE, given in our schools.  When one reads the Irish Catholic Bishop's Conference document, Guidelines on Relationships and Sexuality Education, one sees why our education is so inadequate.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>Any attempt to communicate &quot;the facts of life&quot; as mere facts without reference to the religious and moral dimensions of human sexuality and without reference to the pupil's need to grow in maturity would be a distortion.  Scientific facts are not the whole truth about human sexuality and reproduction.  To allow children to become aware of the mere facts without being helped to see them in their rich human meaning would be to deprive them of the truth.<\/blockquote><p>According to the Irish Episcopal Conference's document, entitled Catholic Preschool and Primary Religious Education Curriculum for Ireland, a &quot;Christian practises the virtue of chastity by cultivating decency and modesty in behaviour, dress and speech&quot; and sexual intercourse &quot;is an act of love within marriage&quot;.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, most school students receive RSE that is grossly distorted by the religious ethos of their schools.  In many cases, it is provided by outside religious agencies.  It is a model that is desperately failing young people and wider society.  A transformation is needed.<\/p><p>Another NUI Galway report on sexual health and attitudes in 2017 showed that 45% of females and 41% of males reported their first sexual intercourse as having occurred at 17 years of age or earlier.  It demonstrated the horrifying prevalence of sexual assault, with 12.5% of females and 2.5% of males reporting experiencing sexual assault where physical force or threats of physical force were used, and 20% of females reporting sexual contact being attempted unsuccessfully in that way.  A transformation is necessary when one considers some of the backward attitudes that are still prevalent in society, particularly among men.  Of males, 37% agree with the statement that, if a girl acts like a slut, she will eventually get into trouble and 35% agree with the statement that guys do not usually intend to force sex on a girl, but sometimes they get too sexually carried away.<\/p><p>The worldwide prevalence of sexual assault, harassment and rape was seen in the #MeToo movement, where 4.7 million people posted #MeToo comments on social media within the first 24 hours.  It expanded from there.  It is linked to the pornification of mainstream culture.  An article by Dr. Debbie Ging explains what that means very well.  According to her, it is not about the greater visibility of sex, but of the greater visibility of sex as sex in which women are degraded, the sexual double standard still prevails and consent remains disputed.<\/p><p>There is a backlash on the street and on social media and in movements against that sexist culture.  We saw the large protests in the aftermath of the Belfast rape trial around #IBelieveHer and #WeStandWithHer.  Young people are leading that movement with an awareness of the problem of sexual harassment and sexism and an understanding of consent as something that needs to be explicit, mutual and continuous.<\/p><p>Societal change is needed.  A key part of that is the giving of objective and factual sex education.  Instead of being a laggard in terms of RSE, we want to see the world's best sex education.  This Bill will remove the legal barrier to achieving that.  We are not just discussing a few tweaks or minimal changes.  Rather, we are discussing a fundamental change and the introduction of sex education that is factual, impartial, objective and responsive to the needs of young people.<\/p><p>We are discussing sex education that is LGBTQ+ positive and which teaches in a positive way about all sexualities, including heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality and asexuality, and one that covers all genders - male, female, gender fluid people and non-binary people.  The desperate need for this can be seen in the crisis of mental health for LGBTQ young people.  A GLEN survey in 2016 found that 56% of LGBT people aged 14 to 18 had self-harmed and 70% had suicidal thoughts.<\/p> <p> We need sex education that covers methods of contraception comprehensively and educationally.  Currently, there are students who are not taught anything other than abstinence and the model advocated by the Catholic Church.  Sex education that covers the termination of pregnancy in an objective manner is needed due to the experience teenagers have where outside anti-abortion groups are brought into schools to give their views.  Sex education that teaches about sexual health is needed.  STIs in Ireland are rising among young people at an alarming rate; there was an 11% rise in STIs among 15 to 25 year olds between 2016 and 2017.  We need young people to be taught about regular testing for STIs and for them to learn that HIV is not only preventable but also treatable.  Crucially, we need a sex education that has consent at its very core - consent that has to be explicit, mutual and continuous.  It should teach young people that relationships and sexual activity should make them feel good and that pleasure is a measure of consent.<\/p> <p> I want to send a very clear message to the Government that this Bill being left languishing on Committee Stage will not be accepted.  It is being supported by a wide range of organisations, many of which are here.  They and the school students who have pushed it will not accept it simply not going anywhere.  They will not accept the Government proposing minimal changes to our current RSE programme.  The Bill points to a key issue in Irish society, that is the contrast between the influence of the Catholic Church over our schools, healthcare and society and the attitudes of young people and their aspiration for objective, factual sex education and a modern society.  There is no problem with the Catholic Church or other churches propagating whatever beliefs they have about sex but there is a problem with those beliefs being imposed on young people in schools.  We need a separation of church and State.  It is only a year ago the Government wanted to hand over the national maternity hospital to a religious order.  It was forced back by a movement of protest.  We are now having a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment which puts the view of one particular religious belief into the Constitution meaning those who are pregnant are restricted in their choices.  There is a long, dark history in this country of religious-based laws on contraception, censorship, women's position in workplaces and homes and on same sex relationships.  Those laws have been fought against and there have been important victories after campaigns and struggles.  All of that points to the need for the separation of church and State.<\/p> <p> This is the third Bill we have had on the issue of school ethos.  The issue is not going to go away.  People will force it and demand that the Bill becomes law and that the movement will develop and grow.  There is nothing the Government will be able to do to stop it until we have a full separation of church and State and a secular society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800038#RR02300","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524065100,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Ruth Coppinger on the Bill.  In its simplicity, it does what we have needed for a long time in the State.  The Bill complements the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment.  All of us who were engaged in the process of watching and learning from the Citizens' Assembly and who were engaged in the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution will be aware that one of the strong recommendations from that process, which is connected to the question of crisis and unwanted pregnancy, is the question of non-ethos founded, factually based sex education in our schools.  Sex education has been mandatory in Ireland for the past 30 years.  It is a crucial element in fertility control and sex control.  Research confirms that in Ireland and elsewhere, those who have received proper, factual sex education are more likely to use contraception, more likely to be clean of sexually transmitted diseases and are less likely to experience crisis pregnancies in their teenage years and often later in life.  The contribution this measure could make to improving sexual and reproductive health in Irish society will be enormous.<\/p><p>What was formerly called the crisis pregnancy agency of the HSE commissioned research in this area some time ago but it needs to be updated.  Much more is needed, particularly from the Department of Education and Skills, not just from the Department of Health.<\/p><p>Sex education works.  It could work much better if it was better.  We learnt from the deliberations of the Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that in Holland age-appropriate sex education was made compulsory from the age of ten in 2012.  Between 2012 and 2016, statistics show that crisis pregnancies in teenagers decreased by 30%.  It is quite a startling result.  Considering that change in terms of crisis pregnancy, one could extrapolate that a similar result would be shown in the health of relationships, the issue of consent and the question of how young people deal with their sexuality and the issues surrounding it.  If one was to extrapolate from the figures in Holland, at least 5,000 or so crisis pregnancies could be avoided in Ireland every year if we were to deal with sexual education in a correct way.  It would also curtail the rising levels of sexually transmitted diseases among young people.  I learnt today from a group that represents the LGBT+ community that the biggest rise in HIV among men is in teenage young men who are not being educated about protection or about their own sexuality and who face the sort of mental and personal crises Deputy Paul Murphy has talked about.<\/p><p>As has been pointed out, the school ethos trumps all other considerations in the delivery of sex education.  The delivery of the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme, as it is called, to students at both post-primary and primary level is trumped by the consideration of the school ethos.  The RSE programme has been described as too little, too late.  Age-appropriateness has been determined largely by the Catholic Church and very little of the primary school programme prepares children for their approaching adolescence and its challenges.  At post-primary level, the situation gets even worse, with some of the most vulnerable children, such as early school leavers, missing out on lessons that deal with aspects of RSE most relevant to their needs because such lessons are delayed until the final year.<\/p><p>As a community activist, I can tell the Minister the best sex education is delivered by youth groups in the community.  The numbers of young people who go through that service are much more limited than the numbers of young people who go through schools.  Most youth services capture the children most at risk, but not all of them.  A very limited number of young people get the delivery of proper sex education through the youth services which includes discussion and non-ethos based, factual, biologically correct education.  Hats off to the youth services and youth workers who deliver those services in the community.  Children with special needs, as a result of disability and challenging behaviours, or children from ethnic minorities, Traveller backgrounds or new communities are very poorly catered for in our system.  A very worrying aspect of RSE particularly at post-primary level is that it is contracted out, often to visitor or outside facilitators.  The vast majority are from agencies run by or strongly associated with the Catholic Church.  When asked at the committee about what regulation the Department imposes on these agencies, we were told by the Department official, Ms Emer Egan:<\/p><blockquote>There is no regulation of such agencies.  If an agency has an approach inconsistent with good educational practice and at variance with the policy of a school, the school should not engage it.<\/blockquote><p>The Department does not regulate them.  That is quite a shocking fact. <\/p><p>There is very little monitoring or evaluation of what these visitors do in the classroom in practice and there is no national audit of the extent to which they are used or how effective they are.  The limited research available indicates around 40% of our schools use them and in some schools, particularly at senior level, 90% of RSE classes are given by outside facilitators or visitors, most of them with a strong Catholic ethos.<\/p><p>The challenges facing our children as they try to develop a healthy attitude to sex and relationships are enormous, particularly in the age of online pornography, sexual predators and widespread misogyny, as has been witnessed in the #MeToo campaign and the recent Belfast rape trial which has brought an admission from young people that they are faced with misogynistic attitudes daily and do not know how to handle them because they are not being educated properly and factually to deal with sex and sexuality.<\/p> <p> Our children need and deserve the best preparation for adult life and they are very unlikely to receive it from an institution that has historically shown more concern for its own institutional power than for the children over whom it wielded that power.  As Deputy Paul Murphy said, it is about time we stopped paying lip service to this and saw it though to the end so that we have full, proper, non-ethos based education for all children in all our schools and that sex education is made compulsory, as it has been in other European countries.  We do not have to look very far for this.  Results in Britain, where sex education was made compulsory from an early age in 2012, and in the Netherlands show the positive outcomes when it is removed from an ethos-based system and delivered to children at appropriate levels and appropriate ages and when it is inclusive of all gender and sexual preferences.<\/p> <p> It is amazing we are even having this frank conversation in this House and God be with the days one would not be able to say the word \"sex\" in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The fact that we can have this open discussion is a tribute to the Bill and to Deputy Coppinger for bringing it forward.  I appeal to the Minister and the Cabinet to see this through as soon as possible and stop delaying giving our children what they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800039#SS00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524065700,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Coppinger, Barry and Paul Murphy for tabling this Private Members' Bill.  The Government will not be opposing the Bill.  This is a very important area in which we need to make progress.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to undertake a review not just of the content of the curriculum but of how it is taught, and in particular how young people can get factual information about sexual behaviour, orientation, consent and contraception, which is essential and is the wish of all parents.  We need to look at the content of the curriculum because, while it was probably progressive in its time, the late 1990s, it has now certainly been superseded by a lot of changes.  For example, the revolution in access to the Internet is a dramatic change to the environment in which all delivery of education needs to be considered.  The change in respect of marriage equality and in attitudes, not to mention changes in the law, must also be reflected.  The change in the definition of consent in recent years recognises changes in society and needs to be reflected accurately in the curriculum.  The curriculum must be taught in an age-appropriate manner so that young people receive factual information appropriate to their age and stage of development.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the NCCA to look at a number of specific issues in respect of the curriculum, in particular the importance of consent and what it means.  I have asked it to look at developments in contraception and at healthy, positive, sexual expression and relationships.  I have asked it to look at the safe use of the Internet, at social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem, and on LGBTQ+ matters.  Some issues are dealt with well and there have been good recent developments in the content of the curriculum while others are older and need updating.<\/p>  <p>  I have also asked the NCCA to look at how content is taught.  As the committee dealing with the eighth amendment pointed out in its report, there are concerns that some elements of the curriculum might be missed because they are delivered as part of a religious education.  It is only fair to point out, though, that all elements of the curriculum must be delivered regardless of the ethos of the school.  The committee also found that many teachers were uncomfortable with teaching RSE, which raises issues about their own preparedness and planning and the support we provide to them in the form of continuing professional development, CPD, to equip them to deliver.  A legitimate concern was raised about the fact that, in some cases, the teaching of these programmes is not led by the teacher but outsourced.  Best practice is that teachers lead, but that does not preclude them from using other sources and materials.  The committee was right to ask for a thorough review of sexual health and relationship education, and I have undertaken this.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies commented on the revolution that has occurred in Internet access since the curriculum was first conceived.  There are genuine concerns about Internet safety and the abuses that have developed on the Internet.  I commend Webwise, which is an agency under my Department, for the fantastic progress it has made in developing material such as Be in Ctrl, and Internet safety lockers on sexting, as well as a number of other worthwhile programmes, the most recent of which involved 80 student ambassadors who deliver Webwise by means of student-led intervention in their own schools.  I was pleased that the recent all-party committee on children had a discussion on Internet safety.  There was agreement on all sides of the House that the quality of the material being developed by Webwise was of a very high standard.  We have to make sure high-quality material is delivered in an effective way in all schools.<\/p>  <p>  Many have commented on the coarsening of relationships by easy access to pornography, and this is a genuine concern, so it is crucial we equip young people with the appropriate capacities and to be discerning and respectful so that they have healthy relationships.  It is important that schools play their part in providing this in an effective way and that young people get access to factual and objective information regardless of the ethos of their school.  Ethos is important and it does provide young people with a very strong moral anchor in their own attitudes to sexuality and relationships.  It provides a very wholesome and strong anchor in the personal development of many people and I respect that, but equally, as Minister for Education and Skills, I am determined that we will have a programme of education on sexuality and relationships that is modern, recognises the realities of our communities and the diversity within them and respects the importance of informed consent in all relationships.<\/p><p>These are issues of major concern.  The NCCA is best placed to undertake this work.  It will have access to consultations carried out on the broadest possible basis.  It will have regard to research being carried out in second level schools by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, for example, and it will benefit from the input of many stakeholders in the education world.<\/p> <p> We could quibble about some of the content of the Bill.  A criticism I have is that providing in primary legislation the material that should be covered in a programme could be limiting in the longer term as issues such those in question develop.  We would not want to have to go back to primary legislation every time we wanted to update a curriculum.  That, however, is an issue that can be discussed.  There are constitutional considerations that must be borne in mind in enacting any legislation.  We must make sure we stay on the right side of those because there are constitutional requirements in Articles 42 and 44.  It is important that any legislation, as it develops, respects these.<\/p> <p> I fully respect, however, the spirit in which this legislation has been tabled by the Deputies concerned.  I hope the review the NCCA is undertaking will become available in a timely manner.  It is important that the council be given the time to consult those who have a legitimate right to have their say, and it is important that the best professional input be received because the curriculum ought to be designed by people with experience in curriculum development, continuous professional development and teaching.  With respect to all the drafters of the Bill, some of whom are education experts, we have to ensure in primary legislation that we respect others who have a role to play, and that is why I believe the appropriate way of proceeding is to get the report back from the NCCA.  It will be available to us as we work on this legislation in due course.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for introducing this Bill.  The Government will not be opposing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800040#TT00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524066300,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with my colleagues, Deputies Fiona O'Loughlin and Declan Breathnach.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il acknowledge and support the call from the Citizens' Assembly and the Oireachtas committee on the eighth amendment for improvements in sexual health and relationship education in schools, youth clubs and other settings.  Similarly, we acknowledge and support the calls from the joint Oireachtas committee on the eighth amendment in regard to second level schools, and we also acknowledge the concerns expressed in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We acknowledge and support the committee's recommendation for a thorough review of sexual health and relationship education.  For the reasons the Minister outlined, however, we have a principled objection to this Bill on the basis that Ireland has never legislated in law for a curriculum of any type.  Instead, we left it to expert reviewers, namely, the NCCA, to consult bodies in education.  We have never put in law what should be taught in our classes.  We have left it to teachers and other experts to  decide, and politicians have not got involved.  They should not if we want to provide the best possible fact-based and respect-based education.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has announced a review of relationships and sexuality education in schools, to be undertaken by the NCCA, along the lines called for by both the Citizens' Assembly and the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  This review will cover both the curriculum and support materials in addition to the serious concerns over the delivery of the curriculum to students.  It is our wish in Fianna F&aacute;il - we assume it is the broad wish in the D&aacute;il - that this review be carried out, concluded and implemented as expeditiously as possible.  That is our one concern over the process.  On balance, it seems that the process will actually happen more quickly than legislation, considering the way legislation is going.  That has been acknowledged by others.  It is essential from our point of view that the process be engaged in as thoroughly and expeditiously as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The joint Oireachtas committee decided some months ago, for its 2018 work programme, to seek expert input and carry out a review of relationships and sexuality education.  The Chairman can speak for the committee in that regard in due course.  By specifically providing for the content of the curriculum, this Bill goes against all precedent.  It is a bad precedent to set.  Children and young adults are best served by the NCCA, which effectively involves teachers, educationalists and other professionals seeking expert views from outside groups, as I acknowledge the Deputies who introduced this Bill have done.  The council would come up with a detailed curriculum that undoubtedly will have many of the items the Deputies have set out in legislation.  On that basis, we cannot support the Bill.  I have said this before about other educational matters.  I talked about a smart phone ban last week.  I would not like to legislate for that.  The less legislation in education, the better.  The education system, involving teachers and educationalists, can react to matters as they arise.  The relationships and sexuality curriculum is over 20 years old.  There is no doubt that many aspects of it require review but there are also quite positive aspects.  At the time, it would have been highly controversial.  I certainly remember controversy.  There is little controversy over it now and people support it.<\/p>  <p>  We want to see the review carried out as soon as possible.  As a member of the Oireachtas education committee, I invite anybody interested to make a submission to the committee by Friday.  As the Chairman will outline, many people have already made submissions.  It will take a lot of committee time, which is limited, to hear from everybody.  Their voices will be very important.<\/p>  <p>  The other aspect of this Bill about which we have concern is that the amendment on the characteristic spirit of schools has been produced without any consultation with the education partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800041#UU00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1524066300,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800041#UU00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1524066300,"counter":584,"content":"<p>We acknowledge there is an issue.

I certainly hope many of them will appear before the education committee.  I am sure members of Solidarity who are not members of the education committee will be able to attend its hearings and ask questions in the most thorough fashion.<\/p>  <p>  It is the case that the Minister's review has come at a critical juncture.  While issues of sexual abuse and harassment are mentioned in the original relationship and sexuality education syllabus, there is no mention of consent and its importance.  We really have to send out the message that what has happened to women, and also men, over decades and centuries is not acceptable anymore and must stop.  The education system must play a role in fostering an ethos of respect, consent and equality.  We have to do that.  The best possible way to do so is not to legislate, which could possibly end up in court cases based on the wording of the legislation, but to leave it to the experts in the NCCA.  We are doing that, on balance.  We believe this process will end before this legislation could possibly be passed.  I would love it if the Minister could give a commitment outlining how long the NCCA process would take and when we will see a new curriculum in schools.  That has not been addressed by the Minister.  In fairness to him, however, this review comes on foot of various recommendations.  It is comprehensive and deals with many issues that need to be addressed.  It deals with pretty much all the issues that have been raised in Solidarity's Bill.<\/p>  <p>  It is wrong to legislate for curricula.  We do not want circumstances like those in certain parts of the United States, where elections are fought and won on the basis of what should be in curricula.  It is not a good way to proceed.  We are better off leaving it out of the political system.  Obviously politicians have a role, and the Minister clearly has taken the initiative to get the NCCA to start the review, but the job should be left to the experts and kept out of the political sphere.  We hope this will lead to better and more comprehensive education for young people, and we hope all interested parties will be able to contribute in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800041#UU00600","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1524066300,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that there are very many societal concerns over sexual health and education, and rightly so.
