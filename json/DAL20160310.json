I am conscious that this is an historic moment.  As we assemble on the first day of the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il to elect a Ceann Comhairle we are actually seeing history being made.  Perhaps fittingly, in this the centenary year of our country's Proclamation of our right to self governance, Members of this House will elect their own Ceann Comhairle for the first time.  This process marks a significant change and is the first in a wide range of reforms that are necessary.  We need to separate the D&aacute;il from government, to allow the D&aacute;il to function as a relevant Parliament and not be a servant to government - a distinction that has been rarely, if ever, seen or evident in the past.<\/p>  <p>  The political system as a whole is under scrutiny.  The increased cynicism towards political institutions is an issue we can no longer ignore.  This D&aacute;il is more diverse than any other ever elected and affords us an opportunity and, even more, a necessity to embark finally on a programme of real and comprehensive reform.  All institutions of the State need it, none more so than in here.  As elected representatives, we have to start this reform right here at home in our national Parliament.<\/p><p>The Office of Ceann Comhairle can lead and steer these changes and, most importantly, be a champion of Members' interests.  However, the Ceann Comhairle cannot do this alone, which is why the various proposals which, I think, will be accepted to establish a working group to be chaired by the Ceann Comhairle to be elected today to consider the issue of reform, make proposals and report to the House are very welcome.  This cross-party committee will be responsible for ensuring its work is acted on.  <\/p> <p> I am entering my third D&aacute;il term.  I believe I have the skills and abilities necessary to effect such an agenda of reform to enhance the functionality of the D&aacute;il as a Parliament and to make the Oireachtas more transparent and relevant to the general public.  My role as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has provided me with valuable experience in making committees work and I hope this is generally acknowledged by my colleagues.  The committee carries out a very heavy work programme and has published 36 reports.  I am committed to giving committees more power in the upcoming term.  <\/p> <p> I do not want to pre-empt the work of whatever working committee is set up, but there are a couple of issues at which we should look as a starting point and one of which is the use of the guillotine.  Deputies are elected to legislate and we should be given time.  There is no necessity to impose the use of the guillotine.  Given the diverse make-up of the House, we need to recognise the need to give smaller groups more speaking time and this is something that must be worked out.  In giving more power to committees and the Ceann Comhairle more influence on the Order of Business a fundamental role of the Speaker of the House should be deciding the agenda of Parliament of which he or she is cathaoirleach.  If all of these measures are combined and acted on, we can allow for the guillotine not being used and more speaking time for smaller groups to get work done.  More power for committees is a key part and central plank of this.  <\/p> <p> We need to rebalance the way business is done and can work together to achieve this common aim.  Enhanced oversight and scrutiny of the Government by the Oireachtas, including the D&aacute;il, is central to this.  This, in turn, will allow for better quality legislation and a more expedient way of delivering it.  We could adopt best practice from other countries such as setting aside time, either in committee weeks or by way of the arrangement some of us witnessed in the Scottish Parliament under which mornings are set aside for committees and afternoons for plenary sessions in order that Members will not be running back from committees to vote in the House and we can dedicate our time to the work of committees.  <\/p> <p> The D&aacute;il - the national Parliament - has the power to change the way it does its business.  It is up to it and Members to see what it can make of this opportunity.  The vote to elect a Ceann Comhairle will give the Deputy elected a mandate to work with all Members in driving forward an agenda and the reform proposals necessary.  As I said, we cannot do this alone.  In co-operation with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in particular, the Ceann Comhairle will have to seek real D&aacute;il reform during his or her term of office.  Let this be the first day on which we see real reform of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The people who elected us nearly two weeks ago expect as much and we must deliver.  I believe I am the right person to drive forward this change for the benefit of all Members of the D&aacute;il.  History will probably reflect positively on the events of today in the manner in which the new Ceann Comhairle is being selected, but the jury is still out and it is up to us to determine whether history will reflect positively on the work we will do from now on.  Therefore, it is important that, with good will and co-operation, we all work together.  I am asking for Members' support.  <\/p> <p> I wish my colleagues who are also running the very best.  It is important that whoever is elected today have the support of all Members of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000004#B00600","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1457568900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Bernard J.

There have been changes in recent times, not only in this country but also in many democracies throughout Europe and the rest of the globe.  It is important that we be prepared to react to and accommodate changes as they take place and before it becomes necessary to do so.  One of the things this and future Parliaments must be prepared to do is to anticipate long before things develop what is likely to happen and how we should respond to them.<\/p>  <p>  I hope I have gleaned some experience in the years I have spent in the House and learned a little.  I am willing to learn more all the time.  Some of the things which I believe are sacrosanct at this stage are, first, the rights of the Member.  The late Oliver J. Flanagan once told me that I should never allow my rights in Parliament, including my right to table parliamentary questions, regardless of whether I was in government or opposition, to be eroded.  He gave very good advice which still stands to this day and is more important than ever.  If it is possible to gain information on an issue by way of a freedom of information request, it should also be possible to gain the same information through a parliamentary question.  If that was the case, as I believe it should be, there would have been no need for many of the inquiries that have taken place in recent years.  If I happen to be successful, I can only undertake to say I would like to see the principle that every Member has the right to raise a parliamentary question on any issue at any time and expect to receive a substantive reply honoured.  That is hugely important to the entire democratic system.  <\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the way we do our business.  My colleague, Deputy Andrew Doyle, has already referred to this issue.  We need to change because we are in the public arena to a greater extent.  The outgoing Ceann Comhairle introduced one very important innovation to this House in introducing and facilitating live broadcasting of its proceedings.  It has changed and should change completely the way we do things.  It has brought us under the microscope to a far greater extent.  It has allowed members of the public the length and breadth of the country to observe at first hand the performances of their elected public representatives.  That is as it should be.  We need to be able to conduct our business in a dignified way without rancour and bitterness in order to accommodate each other's opinions at all times, even though we might hold differing opinions.  That is part of the democratic process established in many Parliaments all over the world, none more so than this one.  If I am successful, I hope I can contribute in some way to the fulfilment of the rights of individual Members of the House in a way that is meaningful to them and the people who elected them.  The people who elected every one of us sent us here as messengers and we bear a huge responsibility for them in that we need to be able to respond to them in a meaningful, substantive and responsible way.  <\/p>  <p>  I offer my good wishes to my colleagues who are also contesting the election.  Let the better person win.  Whoever is Ceann Comhairle will definitely have a challenging role to play, but he or she will be assisted considerably by the proposed changes in D&aacute;il reform.  The new Ceann Comhairle will preside over a standing committee which will order the manner in which we will do business and eliminate much of the conflict that arose in the past.  This is hugely important.  <\/p>  <p>  I thank my colleagues who signed my nomination papers and offered support.  I hope I can justify their trust in the time ahead.  Members of the House, many of whom are serving for the first time, will long remember this day with fondness.  It will be a memory they will cherish for the rest of their lives.  This is a very important day.  Being elected to the national Parliament carries with it a very important responsibility.  I hope we can all live up to the high expectations the public have for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000005#C00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1457569500,"counter":19,"content":"<p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il le gach uile duine at&aacute; tofa go dt&iacute; an 32&uacute; D&aacute;il.

We have each come through a tightly fought contest and most of us will have memories of challenging and perhaps even blistering moments.  The election is now behind us.  On 26 February, the people spoke.  They have given us an honoured mandate and one which no doubt we will all strive to respect and fulfil and so it is that we meet here today to take the first steps in the outworking of the people&rsquo;s decision.  For the first time in our parliamentary democracy we, the elected Members of the D&aacute;il, will decide who among our number will preside over the business of this House, who it is we will entrust to oversee the fair conduct of our deliberations and exchanges in this Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  The position of Ceann Comhairle and the allied roles of that office require experience of parliamentary procedures and a disposition that is respectful of all opinion and the right of all to have their views expressed and heard.  I believe that in the past 19 years I have acquired the required experience and have demonstrated that I have the skills and the natural disposition to serve in this important role.  I have over these past four D&aacute;il terms worked closely with colleagues of all political opinion, party members and Independent Deputies alike.  I have been an active and front-line spokesperson in technical groups in two D&aacute;il terms.  I have been convener of cross-party and Independent Members in two major health-related campaigns, Justice for the Victims of Michael Neary and Justice for the Survivors of Symphysiotomy.  I am an active member of the Oireachtas group on mental health and I am a founding and executive member of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association.  I have considerable experience of working on Oireachtas committees, including the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Finance and on Health and Children.  I believe that while I was a passionate and committed advocate of my and my party&rsquo;s policy positions and outlooks in these fora, I was at all times an interested member and listened to all contributions and was jointly involved with colleagues from government and opposition in producing a considerable body of work, reports and recommendations.  I have openly campaigned with outgoing Government Ministers and Deputies on the children&rsquo;s rights referendum and on the referendum on marriage equality.  I have at all times demonstrated my willingness to work with colleagues of all parties and none in the interest of the common good and of outcomes of importance to Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  The Ceann Comhairle must of necessity be independent of government and opposition.  It is my certain view that the Ceann Comhairle is duty bound to uphold the primacy of the individual parliamentarian over and above all considerations of party or groupings.  He or she must conduct the business of this House in a fair and impartial manner and adhere to the highest standards of the office.  D&aacute;il reform has been much commented on of late.  It is not within the gift of the Ceann Comhairle to make changes to the conduct of business already governed by D&aacute;il Standing Orders.  However, in his or her capacity as chair of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Ceann Comhairle can facilitate and encourage real and substantial change.  As Chair of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the Ceann Comhairle can lead effective change in Members&rsquo; interests.  As a member of the Presidential Commission and of Comhairle na Mire Gaile among other roles, there is a lot to the position that Members in the Chamber and the wider public do not see. <\/p>  <p>  I am greatly interested in taking on this honoured responsibility.  I am humbled by the support of colleagues who have nominated me and I thank them for their encouragement.  In conclusion, I ask each of the Members to consider supporting me this morning.  I respectfully request their number one support and if that is not possible, their number two would be greatly appreciated.  If called upon on the conclusion of today&rsquo;s ballot, I will proudly and solemnly declare that I will duly, faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and ability execute the office of Ceann Comhairle of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann without fear or favour.

Is c&uacute;is bhr&oacute;id dom &eacute; a bheith ainmnithe mar iarrth&oacute;ir do phost an Chinn Chomhairle agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och do mo chomhleacaithe as a gcuid ainmneacha a chur leis an iarratas.  Le c&uacute;pla l&aacute; anuas, t&aacute;im tar &eacute;is a bheith ag stocaireacht agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och do chuile dhuine a thug an t-am chun ceist an toghch&aacute;in seo a phl&eacute;igh liom.  D&rsquo;fhoghlaim m&eacute; go leor agus bhain m&eacute; taitneamh as an dteangmh&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  On this the first sitting day of the 32nd D&aacute;il, we begin our business with a changed approach to the election of Ceann Comhairle.  Change is the word that has been most frequently uttered by Members of this House and in the media since the results of the general election became known.  While some of us have struggled to interpret the people&rsquo;s decision of 26 February, one thing is abundantly clear to me: the Irish public requires us to restructure government and to re-order this D&aacute;il in a manner that more accurately reflects the real needs of a modern Ireland.  The Ceann Comhairle has an opportunity in this situation.  He or she has a responsibility to play a central role in the reform of our governmental, political and parliamentary system.  Every one of the 158 Members here has a mandate that is of equal value and, therefore, each of us is entitled to and must receive in this House parity of esteem.  Equally so, each of us has an inescapable responsibility to ensure that the parliamentary forum always conducts its business in a manner that is respectful, constructive and in the interests of the Irish people.  We need to work to create a D&aacute;il that we have reason to be proud of and one in which our people can readily place their faith.<\/p>  <p>  As Ceann Comhairle, I would see my role as an active promoter of reform, based on consultation.  The process of reform must begin immediately and when agreed it must be implemented without fear or favour.  At the heart of what we do must be a change in the relationship between the Executive and the D&aacute;il and the creation of a situation in which the Executive is truly accountable to this elected assembly.  In pursuing this objective, I see the Ceann Comhairle as a servant of the Members and not a slave to the system.  I would be most grateful for the Members' support and commit myself, if elected, to vigorously asserting the rights of the Members and the integrity of the House.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me to conclude without wishing well the four other contenders, Deputies Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Andrew Doyle and my friend of long standing, Deputy Bernard Durkan.  Each would, if elected, give distinguished service.  It would be remiss of us all not to acknowledge that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, with whom many of us might have disagreed on several occasions, devoted himself tirelessly to the service of this Chamber and to the service of the people of Ireland.  He deserves recognition of that in this House today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000006#D00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1457569500,"counter":21,"content":"<p>A Thaoisigh and a Theachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, Dublin Central is the constituency I represent with my colleagues, Deputies Mary Lou McDonald and Paschal Donohoe.<\/p><p>We had the lowest voter turnout in the country and only three constituencies reached a turnout of 70%.  I ask myself why there was that sense of alienation, disillusionment and apathy.  Part of the answer lies in the way we conduct business in this House, the way we conduct ourselves and the way we treat each other.  At times we leave the electorate feeling frustrated, angry and let down because they expect so much more of us.  We owe it to the electorate, those who voted for us, those who voted for our opponents and those who did not vote at all, to do our business in a way that will have the D&aacute;il meaningful and relevant to them and acting in their best interests.  We have to show we are listening to the electorate and that we realise they want us to put in place a government to deal with the issues and problems facing the country, and to do so in a fair, more open and just manner.<\/p> <p> It is a privilege and an honour to be elected.  I am conscious of those former colleagues from the 31st D&aacute;il who lost their seats and are not here today.<\/p> <p> I was part of the Convention on the Constitution that discussed D&aacute;il reform - how to make it more accountable, democratic and efficient.  It is positive and progressive that the position of Ceann Comhairle is no longer in the gift of the ruling parties.  It is very positive that each of us sitting here today had the possibility of standing in this election and there have been five nominees in the end.  It also would be positive and progressive if voting did not follow party and non-party lines - I may be voting myself out of a job before it even happens.<\/p> <p> I did not actively seek the nomination, but I was encouraged to have my name put forward by Deputies, and with the support of my canvassers and campaigners in the Gregory group.  I thank those who nominated me and the others who wanted to nominate me but I had the requisite number.<\/p> <p> In my six and a half years here I have always tried to be fair, to respect the views of others, to respect difference and to listen.  Almost everything in life is done in a collaborative way, through compromise, consensus and reasoning.  I have experienced that here.  I was a member of the Oireachtas group on mental health.  I was a member of another group that worked on prisoner issues.  I chaired the Irish section of AWEPA.  I was part of the Justice for the Forgotten group and a group on animal welfare where members from political parties and Independents worked together.  In each case it was the issue that brought us together and we worked on that issue regardless of our political views.  Of course, the Technical Group was a good example of working in that collaborative way.  Ceapaim gurb &eacute; sin an tsl&iacute; is fearr chun dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh ag obair le ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; ciall san seanfhocal, \"n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile\".  <\/p> <p> People voted for change and they are looking to us to deliver that change.  That begins with reforming the way we do business here in the Chamber and in committees.  It is both a challenge and an opportunity.  Whoever is Ceann Comhairle must, with the relevant committee of like-minded people who are committed to reform, deliver on that reform.  It is a reform that I hope will mean people will have credibility and confidence in democracy.  It means doing whatever is necessary to increase the authority and autonomy of the Oireachtas so that we legislate in ways that are fair and equitable.  It also means that electoral commission really getting going.  It means committing to the procedures and practices that encourage and ensure transparency in all decision making.  It means equality-proofing of budgets and an evidence-based approach to all resource allocations.<\/p> <p> It means moving from the adversarial, the conflict, the theatrics, the shouting-down, and the interrupting that sometimes has this House looking more like the Coliseum than a Parliament.  It means a different way of setting agendas.  It also means accepting that whoever is in government is not all-seeing and all-knowing and that those not in government have nothing to offer.  It also means being prepared to involve others who are not political.  That means a Ceann Comhairle who will ensure respect for difference, who will ensure questions are answered, who will ensure meaningful debate and constructive criticism, and who will drive an appropriate agenda.  It might not make the headlines; it might not make for good or sensational television, but it would go a long way towards eradicating the apathy and disillusionment I mentioned at the beginning.<\/p> <p> Bismarck said that politics is the art of the possible.  Anything is possible, including a woman Ceann Comhairle, which would be a precedent.  I am conscious of those countries where women do not have a voice at all today.  I think most importantly we need a person who is best for the job regardless of gender, age or politics.<\/p> <p> We have major challenges ahead, including in housing and homelessness, and health, especially for those with disabilities, with mental health issues and those in addiction.  We have major challenges regarding climate and the environment.  We have challenges regarding our new communities and we are a long way from being progressive in animal welfare.  I think of our communities and our youth services are areas of great need.<\/p> <p> Deirim ar&iacute;s, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.

Furthermore, I will endeavour to follow in the footsteps of Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett who, in a deeply difficult time for this country, played a central role in this Chair in steering this House through often uncharted waters.  I am aware that in the time to come, tempers may fray and disagreements may flare up.  I promise you I will adjudicate without fear or favour based on the respect for each Deputy's inalienable democratic mandate.  I implore you, the Members, to respect one another's voices as each of us stands not simply for himself or herself, but for his or her constituents across every reach of this country, in town, city, village and countryside.<\/p> <p> Disagreement is the beating heart of a democracy but argument is the lifeblood of a vibrant chamber and mutual respect is the foundation of an effective parliament.  Our unprecedented election of this position is just the first step of what I hope will be many on the road to reforming the workings of our political system.  I personally am fully committed to overseeing that crucial task.  More than 100 years on from the foundation of our Republic, the democratic institutions of the State have often been tested; their strength has not been found wanting.  We have stood up when many believed we would fall and this House has played an essential role in withstanding the storms of history.  The great project of Irish independence, which the first D&aacute;il embodied, still endures in the soul of this 32nd D&aacute;il.  That it continues is an historic responsibility that rests upon the shoulders of everybody in this Chamber.  I look forward to putting in train and overseeing the implementation of deep-reaching reforms that will benefit both those of you seated here today and the people of the country, as well as the generations that will follow us into this, the people's Chamber.  I look forward to working with you all in the coming years as we endeavour together to build a better republic for all our citizens.

As the youngest Deputy in my party, I am immensely proud to do so.  I may be new to this Chamber but I know the difference this Taoiseach has made to the country.  Perhaps it is hard to see and sometimes, indeed, hard to hear through the sound and fury of political opposition.  Yet, his achievements are there and his achievements will last.  These achievements include marriage equality, the country being saved from the financial abyss, an end to the tide of emigration of people my age, two increases in the minimum wage, saying goodbye to the troika and a change in politics for the better and forever.  Your election today is testament to that kind of change and I congratulate you most sincerely, a Cheann Comhairle. <\/p><p>When the Taoiseach was first nominated, the country was asked to trust in the untested and to hang out its brightest colours in faith.  There is always the idealism of the untested, the ideal perfection, but that is not reality.  We know the reality.  The reality is that experience bloodies and experience bruises sometimes.  There is no doubt that being in government has bruised us as a party too.  However, while in government, we took on the challenges for the greater good of the country.  I am proud this Taoiseach has always put the country first and confident he always will put the country first.  A Taoiseach should always be fighting for the good of our society, economy and country, and Deputy Enda Kenny, always has.  It has not been perfect and there is so much more to do.  However, one can only build a house on firm foundations.  There is no doubt that this Taoiseach has strived to build those foundations in a selfless, consistent way, day in, day out.  We can now build on those foundations, if we so choose.  In this year, the centenary of our Republic, it is perhaps worth reflecting on that.  <\/p><p>When I was younger the Taoiseach gave me the advice of Thomas Jefferson - &quot;In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.&quot;  I will stand with him today and always.  He brought this party back from being written off.  Far more important, he brought our economy and our country back when many had written us off.  We should not lose sight of that.  As we mark 100 years of independence, we can look forward to a brighter future.  I believe Deputy Enda Kenny is the man to bring us towards that brighter future.  I am proud to nominate Deputy Enda Kenny today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000011#BB01300","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1457571900,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I am seconding the nomination of Deputy Enda Kenny as An Taoiseach but, first, I congratulate you, a Cheann Comhairle, on your election.

His hard work in very difficult times has helped to create a climate where people can return to work and education, providing hope and opportunities for the many young people who wish to return home from abroad.

I move that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann nominate Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for appointment by the President as Taoiseach.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is very well qualified to undertake the duties of the office of Taoiseach.  In nominating him, Fianna F&aacute;il is making it clear that it is opting for a change of Government because that is what people voted for.<\/p>  <p>  First elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1989, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has been re-elected on every occasion since to represent the people of Cork South-Central.  He is an honest and passionate republican who believes in Ireland and wants to deliver a fairer society for all.  Deputy Martin has extensive experience in this House.  He is a former Minister for Education and Science; Health and Children; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Foreign Affairs.  He has represented the Government with distinction in Northern Ireland, Europe and across the globe.  For the past five years, he has led the Opposition and tenaciously highlighted issues that were having a negative impact on communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  During his time in opposition, he reached out to people and listened to their problems with sincerity and empathy.  He recognised that families and communities were struggling and that Ireland was experiencing a two-tier recovery with some of her people being left behind.  He saw at first hand how public services were depleted, how frustrated people were and how difficult it had become to access even the most basic essential services.  He is a strong believer in politics and has been a positive advocate for the people he serves.  He has led the way in bringing forward proposals to reform how politics is done in our country.  The failure to implement any meaningful political reform over the past five years is the single greatest failure of the last D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  On a personal level, it is a huge honour for me as a new Deputy in the Thirty-Second D&aacute;il to be nominating Deputy Martin.  He has been an invaluable mentor to me throughout my time in politics and has always made himself available to assist me and other younger representatives within the party on our journey through political life.  He has shown courage and determination in bringing a new generation into politics and bringing about real changes in the way we do our business.  As party leader, he has always endeavoured to be inclusive and to ensure that all voices are heard and respected.  I have no doubt that he will be a strong advocate for young people in this country and that he will continue his commitment to political reform and inclusivity in this House.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin believes in the people of Ireland.  He knows this is a country rich with immense potential and generosity of spirit.  People want an Ireland for all and not just for a few.  With Deputy Martin's determination and work ethic, I know he could lead the next Government to achieve this objective.  Throughout his political life, he has been approachable, fair minded and straight talking.  He faces challenges head on and knows that people want a decent society.  In conclusion, I and my party colleagues consider him to be uniquely well qualified to be Taoiseach and to lead Ireland towards the realisation of our shared objective - an Ireland for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000012#CC00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1457572500,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir agus an phribhl&eacute;id domsa ar an &oacute;c&aacute;id stairi&uacute;il seo seasamh os comhair na dTeachta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir mar Theachta nuathofa do Dh&aacute;ilcheantar an Mh&iacute; Thoir.

In this time of uncertainty, instability and hardship for many families and communities, Ireland now needs strong, proven leadership.  Ireland calls out for a leader of vision - not the narrow vision of the conservative establishment parties, but a vision that embraces this entire island, that goes beyond the Border and encompasses both the North and the South of Ireland and all of its people, whether Catholic, Protestant, dissenter or other.  As the leader of the only all-Ireland republican party and the largest all-island political party, and as one of the architects of the Irish peace process, Deputy Gerry Adams has consistently displayed qualities of strong leadership, courage and perseverance.  He has clearly shown that he is willing to reach out to, listen to and work with those who have opposed him.<\/p><p>He has successfully built peaceful relationships between the most bitter of opponents.  Ireland calls out for a leader who will give hope back to the people, to those who have struggled on the watch of previous Governments and who struggle still; a leader who will protect the vulnerable and the marginalised, our young people and our older citizens, who will create real opportunities for decent work and a decent standard of living; a leader who will lift the burden on low- and middle-income families who have been crippled by burdens not of their making and overwhelmed by stealth taxes such as water charges and the family home tax; a leader who is not afraid to take on the elites and the vested interests who laid this economy and society low.  Deputy Gerry Adams will give a voice to those who have not felt recovery - that is, the majority of our citizens.  His positive vision for Ireland will give hope back to the people and will deliver fairness and equality for all.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; tiomanta do chur chun cinn agus neart&uacute; na Gaeilge.

Deputy Gerry Adams is someone who has never put self-interest above or beyond the national interest.

As we approach the centenary of the Rising, about which we will hear a lot over the next number of weeks, it is clear that we live in a very unjust society, where vast wealth is concentrated in the hands of a tiny few while the majority have seen their living standards plummet.  A crisis rages in health and housing, and an attempt is being made to turn water into a commodity capable of being privatised and fetching a profit.  To this day, the church remains entangled with the State and women are denied their civil rights on abortion.<\/p><p>It is clear that, as James Connolly said a hundred years ago, the day has passed for patching up the capitalist system; it must go.  We need democratic public control and ownership of wealth and resources if society is to be run for people's needs, not profit.  We need a separation of church and State.<\/p><p>Today, we will not vote for the identical twin candidates of the two parties that imposed austerity in this country, nor can we endorse the candidate of a party that is claiming to be the friend of ordinary people while implementing austerity in the North and which is based on one side of the community.  All three candidates who have been proposed accept the crumbs of the fiscal space and thus cannot deliver the real change that is needed by the majority in society.  We need the immediate abolition of the water charges, which were clearly rejected by the majority of the electorate, and we support and call for an extension of the boycott to make sure those charges are finished off while the two parties dither over whether they will carry out abolition.  Neither can we wait any longer for a State-backed housing programme to deal with the housing emergency and for NAMA to be declared an agency for affordable housing, which the previous Government refused to do.  We need to end the 32-year hypocrisy of the eighth amendment to the Constitution and allow women to make this decision for themselves in all cases, not just a few.  To fund our public services, we need to end the use of our country as a tax haven and to take control of the wealth of the 1%.<\/p><p>James Connolly wanted to change the system, and we agree with him.  Sixteen days before the Rising, Connolly outlined who will change Ireland, and in whose interests, when he said in the pages of <i>The Workers' Republic<\/i>:<\/p><blockquote>Not the rack-renting, slum-owning landlord; not the sweating, profit-grinding capitalist; not the sleek and oily lawyer; not the prostitute pressman &ndash; the hired liars of the enemy.  Not these are the Irish upon whom the future depends.  Not these, but the Irish working class, the only secure foundation upon which a free nation can be reared.<\/blockquote><p>The candidates of the socialist left will not win the position of Taoiseach today but, in standing, we are making a declaration of intent in this D&aacute;il.  We intend to have a strong, independent voice for workers in this D&aacute;il.  We invite everybody who wants real change in this country to get involved in the political process and to join with us to help build a new mass party for working people in this country in order to finally replace the thoroughly discredited and compromised Labour Party, a party of working people for working people and for a society ruled and run by working people in the interests of the majority.  To this end, I propose Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett for the position of Taoiseach in the 32nd D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000013#DD00300","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1457573100,"counter":75,"content":"<p>To remark on this place, it feels much smaller than it looks on the television, I have to say.  Maybe it is because there are lots of people in the seats, but it does feel a good deal smaller than the image that is portrayed.  However, I feel quite tall in being here, first, to represent the people who elected us and, second, to nominate Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett as Taoiseach.  I want to say a few words about Deputy Boyd Barrett.  This is a man of principle who has led many struggles of ordinary people against austerity, against tax injustice, against the water charges and, indeed, what he has marked out himself, which was fighting on the question of the environment, the harbour in Dun Laoghaire and saving our forests.  I believe Deputy Boyd Barrett would make a fine Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, we know he is not going to be elected.  Indeed, according to the good man over there, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, nobody will get elected today, so we are in a bit of theatre.  In this theatre, the radical left has as much right to be a player on the stage as anybody else.  I would argue, in fact, that there are at least 90 Deputies in this House who were elected by the people to abolish the water charges and to deal with the punitive action of making people pay water charges.  Over 50% of the population has said \"We are not doing it.\"  That has really set the stage, and that stage has been set on the back of people power.  I want to talk about that, because the radical left, particularly as represented by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, is quite different in the sense that we are here as the voice of people, we are here to represent people and we intend to do a very strong and good job.<\/p><p>However, what really matters is what happens in society because people are constantly being treated as economic units.  The measures engaged in by previous governments have been to see the economy as what we need to do to get jobs and all the rest.  However, we have to start putting people before the interests of a tiny elite who gain from the profits in this country.  People are not economic units.  They are human beings with real needs in the areas of housing, health, education and all of the issues mentioned by colleagues.  This is the way we need to go.  We need to combine people power with our voice here and deliver a society that puts these interests first.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett is being nominated, not because of him as an individual, but because of the issues the radical left has to bring to the table.  In the spirit of the Proclamation, we want to see equality for young people and women.  We want to see a referendum this year - the anniversary of the Easter Rising - on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  These issues are a big challenge to the future government which I assume will be formed some time in the future.  This is about how people see the shaping of the government.  There is clearly a major crisis in political terms in this country.  As far as we are concerned, the voice of people power has been brought into this Chamber and will be well represented by all of us here on the radical left and beyond, by all of the left and, in particular, by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  I formally second his nomination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000013#DD00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1457573700,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Are there any further nominations?<\/p><p>I acknowledge that we have heard four Deputies make their maiden speech on this occasion, in support of their party leaders.

The past two Governments had the choice to protect the most vulnerable in society but instead both of them chose to protect the super rich, the bankers and the bondholders.  There are now at least 1,600 children in emergency hotel accommodation.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine claims that between 300 and 350 unnecessary deaths take place each year due to trolley chaos in our hospitals.  This is more than the carnage on our roads.  Yesterday, for example, there were 32 people on trolleys in South Tipperary General Hospital.  In University Hospital Limerick, which serves the northern part of Tipperary, there were 50 people on trolleys.  This is completely unacceptable and must be addressed urgently.<\/p>  <p>  The people have rejected the approach of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  Both of those Governments caused this human emergency.  This new D&aacute;il must take a radically different course to the two previous D&aacute;ileanna.  It must take a course that prioritises human need for adequate medical treatment, including death prevention and the care of all the children of the nation above all else.  I believe there is and should be no higher priority.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I ask the new D&aacute;il to enact the following emergency measure as its first legislative act, namely, that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann set aside and cancel all reductions in universal social charge and-or income taxation granted in the 2016 budget to the 5% of income recipients with the highest incomes and instruct the Government to bring forward amending legislation to enact this measure immediately.  Today, I submitted a Private Members' motion to that effect.  Approximately &euro;125 million will be saved by this measure.  This money should be immediately applied to rescue homeless children and prevent unnecessary deaths due to hospital chaos.  This is the least we might expect on the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  While this measure will, of course, not be enough to remedy the problems of homelessness and inadequate human services into the future, it will ameliorate the position in the short term while fundamental policy changes are formulated and enacted by the new D&aacute;il.  More importantly, it would give a signal that fundamental choices which prioritise the well-being of human beings above all else will be taken by this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Broken promises are eroding democracy and flouting the will of the people.  This D&aacute;il must ensure that citizens are centre stage, with an ongoing input into the democratic process, including the recall of Deputies and the reintroduction into our Constitution of the people's entitlement to instigate referenda and legislation.  I intend to submit proposals to that effect to the new reform committee, which I understand will be established later this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  As a founder member of the Right2Water group, it goes without saying that I will support the abolition of water charges.  These charges and the family home tax are regressive measures designed to load the burden of the crash on those on low and middle incomes, who had no hand, act or part in creating the crisis.  These taxes are designed to protect the super rich from fair taxation.  A situation in which the Exchequer is paying more than &euro;7 billion per year in interest at the expense of under-funded public services must not continue.  That portion of the debt which arises from the compensation of large investors from their failed investments in private banks must be mutualised and negotiations must be reopened immediately on this issue with the European Union authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I contested the recent general election as part of the Right2Water, Right2Change alliance.  Therefore, I will be voting for candidates nominated for Taoiseach who supported and were part of that alliance, namely, Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Gerry Adams, and will oppose the pro-austerity nominees of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000014#EE00300","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1457573700,"counter":79,"content":"<p>In the general election, the Labour Party sought a mandate to continue implementing our policy in government, the job of rebuilding our society and our economy.  We viewed as essential that Ireland would have stable, balanced government to continue addressing entrenched problems, such as health and housing, that will take more time and resources to put right.  We believed the return of the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government offered the best possibility of stable, balanced government and for that reason, we support the nomination of Deputy Enda Kenny as Taoiseach today.<\/p>  <p>  We also support the nomination because the Taoiseach supported key economic and social goals driven by the Labour Party in government, even when they did not form part of Fine Gael's manifesto.  From minimum wage increases to marriage equality and from strengthening workers rights to enhancing maternal care for women, the Taoiseach brought his party with him in recognition of the fact that it was a coalition and that these progressive measures were in the country's and the people's best interest.  That is the importance of compromise and partnership in the national interest.  The electorate has given a greatly increased mandate to those currently on the Opposition benches.  I believe there is, therefore, an onus and responsibility on those same parties, groupings and Deputies to step forward in the national interest and not sit back. <\/p><p> None of us is foolish enough to believe that Sinn F&eacute;in and the ultra-left are likely to suddenly play their part.  If they are remotely serious about fixing Ireland's problems, they should be prepared to make sacrifices in the national interest, as opposed to promoting narrow partisan agendas.  We sometimes forget that one of the basic demands that people make of politicians is that they should be prepared to govern and take decisions in the national interest or the people's interest.  The Labour Party has never been afraid to take responsibility and sometimes the cost of taking responsibility is very high, as we know.  As Shakespeare put it, \"He jests at scars that never felt a wound\".<\/p> <p> Given the reality that quite a few on the opposition benches do not want to be in government, there is therefore an onus on those who have been there before, although Fianna F&aacute;il presided over and created the crash.  There is an onus on that party to step up to the plate and seek to remedy its wrongs.  In 2011, the Labour Party did not stand idly by in its own best interest and we, as its members, stood by the republic.  Fianna F&aacute;il should do likewise now.  Together with Fine Gael, it can provide a Government with sufficient numbers for stability, and such stability is vital now.  To see why, we need only look at Spain.  Three months after its election, there is still no sign of a government there and Spain's unemployment rate is still over 20%, with business leaders warning that the stalemate is having a chilling effect on investment.<\/p> <p> Ireland and its people cannot afford a similar stalemate when we have returned to strong growth and added 140,000 new jobs.  We have put the public finances back on a much healthier footing, created room for additional investment in our schools, begun the process of raising living standards after a very traumatic time for our people and made significant social progress too, including legislating for the X case, strengthening children's rights and delivering marriage equality.  We also delivered significant political reform.  Some of the first legislation brought before the House by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, was to protect whistleblowers and there was also legislation to regulate lobbyists and restore the Freedom of Information Act.  It will fall to the next Government to protect and extend those gains.  Given that Fianna F&aacute;il was the party that shredded the Freedom of Information Act, I would welcome an assurance from Deputy Martin today that he would commit to retaining these new laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000014#EE00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1457574300,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy vote for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000015#FF00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1457574300,"counter":82,"content":"<p>As Labour leader, I know that if a conservative coalition comes about, there is a real risk that economic policy will veer to the right and further social progress will be limited, if it is perceived at all.

I will give a personal reflection if I may regarding the circumstances as I see them.  I will refer to my family roots at a time when we are all looking back.  I knew all four of my grandparents very well.  I saw one as from a Labour background and one as an Independent.  The two others lived with us for ten years and I knew them very closely.  One of those was as dyed-in-the-wool Fianna F&aacute;il Sliabh Luachra as possible and one was a staunch Michael Collins west Cork Fine Gael supporter.  They hated each other's politics but they got into bed together for 50-odd years and it seemed to work as a relationship despite their dramatic differences.  In the recent days, I sense Fine Gael Members opposite, clutched together, the boys all in the bed with the sheets right up to themselves, pointing across and saying that the rest can have a civil partnership but we know it would not work or be a proper partnership.  It would not be civil, given the circumstances we have in this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  We need a Government and it may be time, as the numbers work, for the civil war divide to come to an end.  It may be possible to do that without opening a new divide, pretending that a left-right divide is the defining issue of our time.  We know the right has to learn that business must show it has a soul and social responsibility.  The left must know how wealth can be generated to pay for the social services we also need.  I heard Deputy Varadkar the other day on the radio speaking a truth that my party learned as part of a Government.  We must start on the basis of trust and certain civility.  It takes time to achieve the changes we must make.  It would not be right or in the interest of a party or the public to set up some sort of short-term arrangement that everybody knows will fail.<\/p>  <p>  In thinking big for the long term and about taking time, I indicate that the progeny of the grandparents I mentioned turned out to be green.  I say to those in the position to form a Government that we would like to see them take some leadership in this respect.  There was a meeting in the audiovisual centre last night that set out the stark reality of the science that is facing us.  These issues, including the protection of our living systems upon which we depend, trump everything.  If a Government is not formed that is willing to show leadership and position Ireland to take its place in the nations of the world as a country accepting that responsibility, grabbing the opportunity to create a new economic model that is socially just, it is not worthy of anyone's support.<\/p>  <p>  We have four or five weeks to see whether that is possible.  We will not be voting for any Taoiseach today and it is likely we will go into opposition in a proposing mode.  We suggest to those who have the opportunity to create a Government that they should not miss this historic opportunity or let the Irish people down.  Let us have a civil coalition arrangement and let this D&aacute;il work in the way the Ceann Comhairle suggested when he spoke earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000015#FF00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1457574300,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Bravo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000015#FF00500","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1457574300,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.

It is nothing personal against either Deputy but if one looks at the role the Taoiseach has played over the past five years it is clear that he betrayed the mandate he was given in 2011.

Sometimes I feel that when one walks through the gates of Leinster House one is entering a twilight zone because everybody believes that D&aacute;il reform is the number one issue.  D&aacute;il reform is important; of course it is important that we figure out how to divvy up speaking time, who chairs different committees and how we deal with x, y and z.  However, of the thousands of people I met and canvassed in Donegal, not one mentioned the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  I did not hear one whisper of D&aacute;il reform on the doorsteps in Donegal and I would say that was also the case in many other constituencies.<\/p>  <p>  People were talking to me about other matters.  A woman with two children wondered what she would do since she was up in court because the banks want to repossess her house.  She does not know where to turn.  Another mother spoke to me almost in tears.  She has a child with life-limiting conditions yet she cannot get support from the HSE.  She is exhausted from battling the system.  I spoke to a grandmother who worked to build this country into what it is today.  She talked about her disappointment after Christmas when she saw her daughter and granddaughter leaving for Australia again.  Those are the issues the people of this country voted each and every one of us in here to deal with.  If we want to fix D&aacute;il reform we can do it overnight, it is simple.  Let us get down to the real issues, however, and deal with the real problems we have.  There was a crisis in health just before the election, but there is still a crisis in health.  There is a crisis in accommodation, including housing, which is still there.  There is also a crisis in homelessness.  If we put names to it does it make it more real to people?  If we mention the names of John Corrie and others, or the name of a woman on a trolley, will it make it real for people?  We need to get real here because there is a sense of disconnect, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned.

We welcome the fact that, on all sides of this House, they are converts to political reform but where did this come from?  We got a message from the electorate which was very strong and very definite.  It was particularly pointed at that side of the House.  It was that there was to be a new politics in this country and that they were tired of the resistance of the major parties to political reform.  They wanted something new, different and radical.  Let us not pretend that this conversion has been sitting there simmering ready to erupt on the Government side; it has been forced on them.  Let us welcome that because that is the message from the electorate.  We will participate eagerly and enthusiastically in all efforts, and in the committee that the Ceann Comhairle is setting up today, for political reform in the full knowledge that that zeal for reform has come from the smaller parties and Independents in this House, and not originally from the major parties.<\/p><p>It is only right that the Members opposite be reminded that they spent the past five years resisting that particular policy which they are pretending to champion today.

Why have we not set up a committee to deal with the issue of housing, and other more acute problems, before the D&aacute;il returns?  Deputy Pearse Doherty was right.  D&aacute;il reform may be fascinating to us, and it may be necessary, but it did not really come up on the doorsteps.  It was not mentioned as an immediate problem.  Why did we not set up a committee to address those immediate problems and come back in four weeks' time with proposed solutions to issues such as homelessness, negative equity, reform of the banks, and other things that have so crucially hurt the people of this country in the past five years?  We have an opportunity and we will engage enthusiastically with those parties to whom we are speaking, and others, if they are serious about addressing the reforms this country and the electorate have demanded from us.  However, I fear that there is a movement once again towards traditional old politics.  We must resist that.

This day four weeks ago I had no idea or ever dreamt that I would be addressing D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a Member of the 32nd D&aacute;il.

That is what is going on here today.

More talking needs to be done, and more should have been done in the past two weeks since the election.<\/p>  <p>  The people of Ireland played their part.  They voted for every Deputy here.  They are relying on all of us to come together and form a government.  There is talk that we may have to have another election.  What difference will that make?  Will the people of Ireland change their minds in a few weeks?  I do not think so.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know what happened in the Civil War; it was long before my time but there is a lot of talk about it.  The bigger parties must get together and offer us a government and give over what I call posturing because time is slipping by.

We have nothing substantial to vote for from any side.  I will be voting against the people proposed today. <\/p>  <p>  There is talk about four weeks.  That is too long.  Two weeks is too long.

Our job is to accept that and get on with providing a stable government to address all the issues.  The Labour Party stood up in 2011 and did that.  The then leader of the party said that we would face enormous difficulties and that the next time we met we would be wading through a sea of placards because we had been briefed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA and the Central Bank.  We knew the economic morass the country was in and we stepped up to the plate.  I will not argue the case for Labour again.  The people have made their choice.  It is now for others to stand up for the Republic, stand into that breach and provide a government.

The fact remains that all 158 Members here have been voted in by the people of Ireland to form a Government; so do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000019#KK00400","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1457576700,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Howlin, I had not intended to speak today, being my first day.  I have listened very carefully to all the speeches made but in particular to the speeches proposing Deputies Enda Kenny and Miche&aacute;l Martin for the position of Taoiseach.  During those speeches people spoke about the progress that has been made over the past five years of the outgoing Government and the commitment of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin to tackle the many crises that all Deputies know exist in our health system, housing system, child care and schools.<\/p>  <p>  As I was listening to these comments, what struck me were the families that will spend tonight in emergency accommodation and the families that will become homeless tomorrow and the day after.  What struck me when I listened to those words were the sick people lying on trolleys for which the numbers have increased again this year on last year as they did on the previous year.  In all areas of public services we can talk about families and particularly women locked out of the workforce because of the cost of child care.  We can talk about the increasing numbers of children who will go hungry because of rising child poverty rates or the still unacceptable level of young people unemployed and continuing to leave the country.<\/p>  <p>  I mention these people in the context of this debate on the election of Taoiseach because these people have been left behind by the outgoing Government.  They have been left behind by Deputy Enda Kenny's two-tier unfair recovery.  They are also the people who were let down when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin last sat around the Cabinet table.  To reuse a theme that Deputy Burton used, these are the people her party sacrificed when it abandoned promise after promise and voted for five regressive budgets introduced under the outgoing Government.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin made a very important point for all of us.  I did not get elected to stand on the sidelines.  I did not put my name forward and ask people to vote for me in order not to take responsibility.  However, my responsibility goes beyond just the election, as Deputy Howlin says, of a stable government.  It is to stand up for those people who have been left behind by the parties that formed the previous two Governments.  I do not believe that a Government led by Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael is in the interests of those people who have been left behind.<\/p>  <p>  Today on Kildare Street outside Leinster House there is an Oxfam campaign van calling on this D&aacute;il to make equality its top priority.  We have had 88 years of the inequality in Irish society led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  My responsibility as a new Deputy, whether in government or in opposition, is to champion that cause of equality and challenge the policies that have generated such deep levels of inequality in order to try to make this country a better place.  That is the reason that not only will I not be voting for Deputy Enda Kenny or Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, but also the reason I will proudly vote for the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Gerry Adams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000019#KK00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1457576700,"counter":137,"content":"<p>T&aacute; ceathrar ainmnithe le bheith ceaptha ag an Uachtar&aacute;n mar Thaoiseach.

This is a special day in their lives and one I am sure they will remember.  It is a special day for them and their families, and I hope that after the proceedings die down they will remember it with a degree of fondness.  I would also like to express my commiseration to the many former Members who were not re-elected on this occasion, many of whom did sterling work in the interests of the country and its people, particularly during the recent crisis years.<\/p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il has so far failed to agree on the nomination of a Taoiseach.  Therefore, in accordance with the precedent set in 1989 and followed through in 1992, after today's sitting has concluded, I will inform the President of my resignation from office.  In accordance with Article 28.11 of the Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the Government and I will continue to carry out our duties until a new Government has been appointed.  Let me assure the Irish people that the Government remains in place and that I and my Cabinet colleagues will continue to work hard in the best interests of the country and of all the people.  My immediate duties as Taoiseach include official travel to Washington to meet the US President, Mr. Obama, the Vice President, Mr. Biden, and the Speaker, Mr. Ryan, for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  Following that, I will attend the European Council meeting in Brussels, which will discuss a number of important issues, including in particular the migration crisis, which has enormous implications for European Union, the future of the Schengen area and the Dublin Convention itself.  The Government and the State agencies are also fully engaged in preparation for the centenary commemoration of the Easter Rising, which will be a respectful and inclusive occasion to mark a truly seminal moment in our democratic history.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond these immediate events, a range of important issues and challenges face Ireland.  The careful management of the economy and the public finances must and will remain a priority, particularly in the complex and uncertain international economic environment.  The presentation of the Spring Economic Statement, the introduction of a new way of dealing with the Estimates, and the presentation of the budget in approximately 28 weeks' time are matters to be focused on.  In a matter of a few short months, the people of the United Kingdom will vote on their future relationship with the European Union, the outcome of which has huge implications for this country and for Northern Ireland.  While Brexit may not have been an issue on the doorsteps in the recent election, it is an issue that is coming at us and the implications are not to be underestimated.  We will continue to provide jobs for our people by driving the implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs, which has been so successful at reducing the rate of unemployment from 15% in 2011 to 8.8% today.  We will work in a diligent way on the critical discussions that must take place at a European level now in respect of climate change issues that are arising and that must be dealt with in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  Five years ago, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party entered government, we did so at a time of unprecedented economic uncertainty for Ireland.  At that time, our very survival was in doubt.  Public finances were out of control, jobs were decimated at an alarming rate and Government had to face unprecedented difficulties.  Many believed the situation was hopeless and that rescuing the economy and ending the bailout was virtually impossible.<\/p><p>The Government faced that crisis head on, with tough and very difficult decisions taken that we knew well would be unpopular, and they still have a lasting effect on many people.  They were necessary, and as a result of those decisions being taken to end the crisis, the bailout was ended and the country is in a different place now.<\/p> <p> As I have acknowledged on many occasions, we did not get everything right over the past five years and we were not able to achieve all we had hoped, but the country is moving in the right direction.  I note the official Central Statistics Office preliminary figures published today demonstrate that our economy grew by 7.8% in 2015, the highest rate for 15 years and the highest rate in Europe for the second year running.  Our proposition for the re-election of the Government of Fine Gael and Labour did not receive the mandate of the people in the general election and it is incumbent on us all to work with the outcome of the recent election and the verdict given by the people.<\/p> <p> I thank all those who served as Members in the outgoing Government in the very difficult circumstances we inherited five years ago.  In particular, I thank the former T&aacute;naiste, Mr. Eamon Gilmore, who was leader of the Labour Party, and the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, for their diligence, commitment and courage in standing up and making very difficult decisions in the interest of the country.  Beyond that, the backbenchers of both parties were on the receiving end of a very difficult public onslaught and I thank them for their courage in standing by the country and its people.  Many of them are not here today because of the outcome of the general election.<\/p> <p> We must continue to address the very real issues in the health area, homelessness and housing.  These are not issues that can be put on hold until a new Government is appointed and they will not be put on hold.  It is incumbent on us all with the privilege of serving in the 32nd D&aacute;il to intensify our efforts to provide this country with a lasting and durable Government.  Since the general election, my colleagues and I in the Fine Gael Party have been deeply engaged in dialogue with many of the parties, groupings and individual Independent Deputies.  These discussions have been very constructive and I have found a strong consensus across the groups on the need for a stable and lasting Government.  As Taoiseach and leader of the largest party in the House, I am fully committed to working over the coming weeks to ensure the people get the Government they need and deserve and on which they have given a verdict.  I invite all those who share that common objective to work with us in the time ahead and see that it can become a reality.<\/p> <p> From many of the contributions I have listened to, it seems that a substantial number of people do not want to serve in a Government and to have the responsibility of making decisions for the future direction of our country.  That is their right and they are entitled to that view.  Those of us who accept the responsibilities of a mandate given by the people in respect of providing a Government for the future of our people and country have a duty to face those responsibilities and deal with them in the best way possible.  There are options and it behoves those of us who accept responsibility, as I do as Taoiseach, Head of Government and leader of my party, to examine all those options in the interests of providing this country with a working Government that will last.<\/p> <p> While the work of forming a stable Government is going on, there must be clear consensus, as there is in the House, that a process should be put in place to make that become a reality.  I am glad the Ceann Comhairle is the recipient of his authority after being independently voted on through the reform example of a secret ballot in the House.  It is true that D&aacute;il reform was not the issue on every doorstep in every constituency; of course it was not.  We also made the change when D&aacute;il committees are set up of allocating members according to the d'Hondt system.  The committees will no longer be the preserve of the Taoiseach or the ruling parties of the day but will be weighted in terms of the numbers of seats that groups and individuals have.  In that sense, I am very glad to see the increased number of women Members in the House.  I know there was controversy about the selection process and the issue of quotas, but regardless of whether it was a help, everybody is here in his or her own right and on the basis of his or her qualities, personality and strength of conviction.  Long may that continue and we would like to see such reform increase in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> Pre-legislative scrutiny has been an important issue of reform that has allowed further engagement for Members.  Having spoken to most Members at this stage, I am very committed to understanding that the respect and integrity of every Deputy must be seen.  In return for that, there will be a change in the way business is done at committee level.  It will not just be a case of wanting more money for this or that every week.  The pot is not endless and people must make recommendations based on their own views about how issues are prioritised.  That will change the nature of debate and the work of committees so that the Executive and Cabinet can make decisions in a much more informed manner arising from a really comprehensive set of discussions.  I wish the Ceann Comhairle the best in his chairing of a standing committee to deal with issues that Members on all sides, including new Members and those here for years, can raise.<\/p> <p> This is obviously not the outcome I personally would have liked to see.  I respect the verdict of the people in the general election and that of the House.  I shall in due course tender my resignation to the President in accordance with the relevant article of the Constitution and see that the Government continues its work in the interests of the people and the country until a new Government is endorsed by the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000025#TT00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Standing Order 112 Select Committee: Motion","time":1457579100,"counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000026#UU00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1457579100,"counter":154,"content":"<p>There are three motions on the supplementary Order Paper.

Last month the Irish people chose to elect a highly diverse D&aacute;il.\u00a0 Each Member of this House carries a mandate and a duty to represent those who elected them and to fight for the policies they advocated when seeking support.<\/p><p>I congratulate all new Members who have been elected.  Each of them has an obligation to work towards resolving the many issues that we met on the campaign trail.  I offer commiserations to those who were not successful in being elected but who had the courage to put themselves forward and compete in a parliamentary democracy.  <\/p><p>No one in here carries the right to claim to speak on behalf of all of the people, or to tell others what their mandates represent.  We have had an element of that already this afternoon.  There is only one core message that we must all acknowledge, which is that a strong majority of the Irish people have voted for change.\u00a0 They have voted for a change of government and a change of priorities and, of course, they have voted for a different type of politics.  <\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has emerged from this election with the support of over half a million people.\u00a0 I want to welcome my new colleagues and to acknowledge the incredible work of our members in every part of the country.  We have gained the largest increase in vote of any party and have more than doubled our representation.\u00a0 We did so based on a very clear platform of priorities for this D&aacute;il and a specific approach to delivering the change we believe is needed.\u00a0 We argued that the outgoing Government should be replaced and that Fine Gael policy in particular had been divisive and unfair.\u00a0 This remains our position.<\/p><p>Following this vote, the most urgent question for us all, as Members of the D&aacute;il, is how we will move forward in addressing the desire of the people for change.\u00a0 It is our intention as a party to continue to work for the permanent removal of the now acting Government.\u00a0 As we have been outlining in discussions with various parties, groups and individual Deputies, our immediate priorities are for urgent action on the housing emergency, addressing the growing inequality in the availability and quality of employment, reversing damaging health policies, and implementing a series of measures to support communities and families.  We have been encouraged by the response in many of our discussions to date and have indicated that we will continue them in a more intensive manner after today&rsquo;s votes.  There has been a lot of talk about strong government.\u00a0 I believe that what the people want first and foremost is good government.\u00a0 Some of the worst governments in the world are strong, and the acting Government was rejected by the people after five years of the strongest majority in our history.<\/p><p>We should all realise that one of the arguments that failed to persuade the people was the claim that there would be chaos unless we immediately had a new Government with a solid majority.  If we respect the will of the people, then it is time to put aside the argument that the speed of formation and the size of the majority are what matters in choosing a new Taoiseach and Government.<\/p><p>Following this vote, the situation we find ourselves in is far from unprecedented.\u00a0 D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has twice in the past failed to nominate a Taoiseach on its first day.\u00a0 There have also been instances in which a Taoiseach lost support and there was a delay in electing a new Taoiseach.  In 1992, the formation of a new Government took nearly two months.\u00a0 During that time urgent business was addressed, including the passage of critical Supplementary Estimates and a Finance Bill measure.  Given the fact that the budget has already been passed and there is no urgent Government measure which requires D&aacute;il sanction, we clearly have the time to deliver a Government that respects the views of the Irish people.  In fact, Ireland is relatively unusual in how fast it normally carries out the business of Government formation.\u00a0 This may well be one of the reasons for the fact that the focus is often placed on who holds power rather than what they do with it.<\/p><p>We have already talked about the need to reduce the excessive control of Government on the work of our Parliament. Let us now show that we are serious by taking up this challenge at the start of the 32nd D&aacute;il in an inclusive and urgent way.\u00a0 Let us do this with a commitment to making this a D&aacute;il in which all Members have both the opportunity and the obligation to contribute and be accountable.  Motion 5<i>b<\/i>is a commendable step in that direction, but we are keen that the committee reach a conclusion before 6 April and that it make recommendations that can be immediately introduced to amend Standing Orders in a way that will fundamentally alter how we do our business in this House.<\/p><p>Reform cannot just be about how we ask questions and the timing of legislation; it has to be much deeper.\u00a0 We need a D&aacute;il that is more independent of the Government, but we also need a D&aacute;il that is more expert in its work and in which the proposals it considers, whichever part of the House they emanate from, are subject to real scrutiny.  That is why I and my party took the initiative, while many of the counts were still ongoing, of calling for D&aacute;il reform as the first item on our agenda.\u00a0 We welcome the fact that there is now a consensus on this.  The failure of D&aacute;il reform efforts in the past has been founded on the fact that the process has been in the hands of a Government majority.\u00a0 If we truly want to change the way we do our business, then the best way to do this is to reach agreement on reform before there is such a majority in place.  This is an issue that we as a party have addressed repeatedly in recent years, publishing a list of more than 100 specific reforms.\u00a0 We have gone beyond general principles and set out exactly how procedures and structures can be reformed in order to implement those principles.<\/p><p>The consensus in favour of a cross-House committee chaired by our new Ceann Comhairle is welcome.\u00a0 Certain reform efforts require consideration of constitutional issues as well as complex statutory provisions.  However, many simply involve the passing of procedural amendments.\u00a0 We believe there is enough detail in the proposals that have already been prepared by parties and Deputies to ensure that proposals for immediate and specific reform can be ready within weeks.  I am pointing that out despite the degree to which some Deputies in today's debate have tried to scoff and pour scorn on the urgency of D&aacute;il reform.  People talk about Irish Water and the debacle that it became.  That is intrinsically connected to the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  Why?  It is because the Water Services Bill was rammed through in 24 hours without any proper scrutiny in the House at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000027#VV01200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1457579700,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Which the Deputy voted on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000027#VV01300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1457579700,"counter":173,"content":"<p>It was then rammed through a second time in an amending Bill without due consideration or any detailed examination.  My point is that D&aacute;il reform is essential in terms of how we deal with issues that are critical to people's lives, including health.  We have had a lot of discussion in the last while about having proper parliamentary engagement on that issue.  Let us not just pour scorn, as some Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies tried to do earlier, on the importance of D&aacute;il reform and its connection with good policy formulation and good outcomes on the key issues that concern the Irish people today.<\/p>  <p>  We believe that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is in a position to immediately take up urgent matters that were central to the election campaign.  That is why I approve of the proposal to bring the D&aacute;il back on Tuesday, 22 March to debate the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and housing matters.  We also tabled a motion on housing today, but we sought consensus with other parties in order to ensure an ordered approach.  We did not try to monopolise the situation by saying that we are the only party that cares about housing and health.  Everyone genuinely has an interest in these issues, so it makes sense to have a consensus and some degree of efficiency in how we conduct our business on 22 March.<\/p><p>If people want to debate more, I am open and willing to do that on 22 March, or 23 March if people want that.  It is important that this has been provided for when the D&aacute;il returns.  If we want to break the dominance of Government in all D&aacute;il matters, there is no better way to start, as we said earlier in our consultations with others, than to schedule issues for debate without the immediate distortion that comes from the House being divided into two sides.

He should allow me to make my contribution to the House.  It would not be possible, so let us begin our work by holding debates where all Deputies have an opportunity to set out constructive action on the issues that should dominate the proceedings of the 32nd D&aacute;il.  I think we have had the agreement of most of the parties in terms of how we schedule these debates around the housing emergency and other issues.  There is precedent for this with at least one lengthy policy debate held on urgent European matters in the period of the acting Government after the 1992 election.  Should other urgent business appear in the weeks ahead, and the outgoing Government has so far not indicated that such business is likely, there will be no difficulty in addressing it before the new Government is formed.<\/p>  <p>  In the past, there has been tendency for leaders and Deputies to stand up and simply seek to re-run the election in their contributions following the vote on the election of An Taoiseach.  I have chosen not to do so today but instead to be constructive about how we can make this a D&aacute;il that delivers to the people credible change in how we do our business and how we make sure we are focused on the people's concerns.  We have a strong democratic tradition in this country.  The situation after this vote this afternoon is not exceptional.  The situation now is as it was before.  Every one of us has an obligation to work on behalf of the people who elected us and on behalf of our country.  Notwithstanding the ritual condemnation of Fianna F&aacute;il by some today and the alleged damage we have done, I noted the degree to which some of them were very anxious to get us into Government as quickly as possible.  In doing this, our first obligation is to operate in accordance with the mandate we sought.  In the days and weeks ahead, my party and I will continue to do this.  Our priority remains to deliver the change of Government, change of politics and change of priorities which the people have so clearly demanded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000028#WW00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1457580300,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The primary purpose of the D&aacute;il today and in the weeks to come is to seek by agreement to provide a stable and balanced Government that will provide the basis for many of the reforms people on all sides of the House indicate they are in support of.  I would warn against excessive procrastination.  The people have spoken and have given mandates to many of the parties here.  There can only be one outcome to the different mandates that is positive for people.  This is the formation of a Government that has the capacity to govern wisely and well in the interests of all of the people of Ireland.  The issue of D&aacute;il reform is important but I would argue that it is secondary to the interests of the people in the formation of a solid, stable and balanced Government for this country.  The people have voted and given mandates as they did so to a variety of different political parties.  Political parties cannot just decide to sit back and not be involved in what the people voted for.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach and possibly the Ceann Comhairle to take the initiative to provide that on each of the days on which the D&aacute;il is assembled - 23 March and 6 April 2016 - there will be a report by the Taoiseach to the House on what progress has been made towards the formation of Government.  I have no problem with the issues that have been identified for debate if that can be agreed.  They are significant issues but they are secondary in terms of the constitutional imperative that the country will need a Government and that there should not be excessive procrastination.  Of course, there must be discussions and people must grapple with new realities in respect of how people voted, which may not have been the outcome for which they wished.  The outcome for which the people voted is here in this House and people cannot avoid their responsibility to give the people of this country a stable and, hopefully, lasting Government.<\/p>  <p>  Inherent in many of the contributions today is an implicit recognition that the country has moved on, not to a perfect place but to a far better place than was the case when we took over in 2011.  As is the case after every election, there is a need for more progress to be made for people's conditions to be improved but that does not mean that we should take for granted the progress that has been made such as the fact that we can now borrow on international markets.  When we came into office, Ireland could only borrow at interest rates of around 10%.  We can now borrow at interest rates of roughly below 1%.  Excessive procrastination will send out a message about the country.  On reflection, people may wish to acknowledge that not everything is perfect in the country but that very significant progress has made, not least the fact that the level of unemployment has fallen from a high of over 15%, so-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000028#WW00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1457580300,"counter":180,"content":"<p>We are dealing with three motions.

At least the Ceann Comhairle and others who spoke on this issue should be clear about that.  The republic of 1916 is still to be established and all of us, whatever our party political and individual positions, should endeavour to achieve that and to work every day for that, not just every 100 years.<\/p>  <p>  In that spirit, I welcome all new Deputies here today, including the 12 new Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and wish them and everybody else here the very best in their roles.  I thank everyone who voted, stood and worked for our party and all of our families.  Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir &eacute; a bheith tofa ag an bpobal, ach go h&aacute;irithe mar Theachta de chuid Shinn F&eacute;in.  I also extend my best regards to those who, for a variety of reasons, whether through retirement or loss of their seats, have not returned to the 32nd D&aacute;il and thank them for their contribution to the 31st D&aacute;il.

As the party with the largest number of votes on this island, as the largest bloc within the Right2Change movement, as the third largest party in the D&aacute;il and the main party of the working class, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to get on with the work of building with others a progressive alternative to the politics of the establishment.

The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste have all dodged that question for the past two years when I and others put it to them.  The Northern Ireland Assembly&rsquo;s Committee for Finance and Personnel has just published a progress report on its investigation and put 2,000 pages of evidence, including much material which was previously undisclosed, into the public domain.  Why can these critically important issues not be debated here?  The committee was rightly critical of both the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and NAMA for the way they handled the sale.  This is the people&rsquo;s money.  The Taoiseach should make a statement to the D&aacute;il on that matter sooner rather than later and we should be able to debate that entire scandal here.<\/p>  <p>  We support the establishment of a sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform as provided for under Standing Order 107.

Meaningful reform of the D&aacute;il has to include the notion of a rotating Leas-Cheann Comhairle, end the practice of excluding the introduction of money Bills from the Opposition benches, afford Oireachtas committees the power to introduce legislation, allow Members decide what the business of the D&aacute;il will be - that should not be the preserve of the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip - and provide for Northern representation here, without voting rights but with speaking rights, which was agreed by a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach and ourselves and others.

He remains the caretaker Taoiseach and the Ministers remain in situ.  They have the right, and I would argue the duty and the responsibility, to attend and be heard in this Chamber.  They are going to come in and make statements but they cannot be held accountable.  It is our firm view that they should be held accountable for their actions and decisions and that the D&aacute;il should meet at least one day a week for meaningful debate, not just to go through the motions or for the optics.<\/p>  <p>  Those of us present here and our party sought a very clear mandate to deal with the issues of, for example, the homeless who remain homeless as we sit here, the families in mortgage distress, the victims of the recent flooding who have still to get redress and others in rural Ireland who have been let down.<\/p><p>I received a call today from a Magdalen laundries survivor who had not yet received a full pension, despite assurances from the Department of Justice and Equality.

If it is not done before the formation of a new government, nobody believes it will ever be.  That type of reform is not good enough.  We need the public, the electorate, to be brought centre stage in the democratic process.

We spent several weeks campaigning on our different policies, priorities and political records, but now the judgment has been made.  Our job is to act as swiftly as possible on that judgment and to respond to the concerns, the needs and priorities expressed by the people, both in terms of political reform and the pressing issues which face vast numbers of our citizens.  The prerequisite for us moving to address those issues is the formation of a Government.  Much as I would like for the parties of the left to be in a position to form a Government, we are not in a position to do so.  That is a campaign which we must continue, namely to convince people of our policies and our priorities.  Of course, we will continue to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the responsibility to move swiftly to form a Government lies with those in a position to do so.  One judgment made by the people, which to my mind is beyond dispute, is that they have asked us to move beyond Civil War factional politics.  Instead, they want issue-based politics.  Those parties, whose histories lie in Civil War divisions but where no real substantial differences exist on issues or policies, have a responsibility not to allow tribal or factional differences delay the formation of a Government, so that we can move on to the issues which need to be addressed urgently.<\/p>  <p>  For our part, as a small part of this D&aacute;il, the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit group is willing to talk to anybody about addressing those issues.  However, realistically, we do not believe we have the same approach to addressing them as do those parties which have the numbers and are in a position to form the majority.  We will do so on committees, whether it is to do with D&aacute;il reform or elsewhere and we will work with and discuss with others ways of addressing those issues.  Now, however, a Government must be formed so we can move on to that discussion.<\/p>  <p>  While a combination of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is not the Government I would want, they have a responsibility now to explain why they cannot form a Government or move on to form one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000031#ZZ00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1457582100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>We have explained it many times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000031#ZZ00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1457582100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>It is now Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000031#ZZ00500","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1457582100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>One voice, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000031#ZZ00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1457582100,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I welcome this motion, one to which we also signed up.

It is the responsibility of all of us - it is why I welcome this motion - to respect the judgment made and to allow this D&aacute;il to have a diversity of voices, as well as a parity of esteem among those different forces elected to this House.  They must all have the opportunity to speak, debate, as well as put forward their ideas, policies and priorities.  These should not just be noble words spoken on the first day of the D&aacute;il, soon to be forgotten.  This business has to be done and settled.  Everybody has said today that they want to see it happen.  Now it has to happen because we had similar promises before.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the points made by Deputies Pringle, Healy and Broughan.  It is an error in this motion not to have reference to the Independents, notwithstanding the need for the more detailed debate about changes to the rules of this House.

There is an incontrovertible message which must be acted upon and that water charges have to go.<\/p>  <p>  An urgency was expressed about the situations in housing and homelessness and in our health service.  These are challenges to which all of us must respond urgently.  The situation regarding them is not acceptable.  All of us have to put up our hands and say they have not been addressed over the past five years but must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I met a man I happen to know outside on the street who informed me that his daughter, who is in a wheelchair, went to accident and emergency in St. Vincent's hospital today.  He was told by a consultant that she might be four days on a trolley before she gets treated there.  That is not acceptable.  We need a Government to be formed.  We need the issue of how the business of this House will be done to be addressed as a matter of urgency, so we can move quickly to address the intolerable situation in our hospitals and the unacceptable situation of homelessness in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000031#ZZ00900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1457582100,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I have a large number of Deputies now offering.

He was the only Member who won an election today.<\/p>  <p>  All Members have great expectations.  Mine is that, in a short time, I would be able to hold various Ministers to account.  I know there will be a caretaker arrangement for the next period.  However, between now and a Government being formed, it is important the issues which face the people of my constituency and across the country are dealt with.  Yesterday evening, there was a car accident outside Drumshanbo in which a young woman was injured.  She waited over an hour for an ambulance to come from Carrick-on-Shannon, which is less than 15 minutes away.  Dynamic deployment of our ambulance services across the whole western seaboard does not work.  I want to be here to hold the Minister to account in respect of that.<\/p><p>It does not work in respect of that.  I also wanted to come here to hold the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to account with respect to the many farmers in my area who have a major problem in getting their entitlements, with respect to the issue of young farmers and with respect to the farmers who have been left behind in trying to get their issues resolved.  <\/p> <p> Another issue concerns St. Patrick's Hospital in Carrick-on-Shannon where the nurse-led service, which was withdrawn in recent months, has not been restored.  A further issue involves many people in my area, the people who live on the Burren Road in Templeport and the people who live in the parish of Gortletteragh, who have tried to obtain a school bus service because the rules have been set in such a way that a school bus will only transport their children to the nearest school, even if it is not the school in their parish.  These are the issues I face in my constituency.  When I came to this House I had the expectation that I would be able to hold people to account around these issues, yet we find we have motions before us that will defer democracy until some time in the future and we do not have a date set for it.  We have been told that on 22 March statements will be read in the House.  That is of little use to the people who put us here.  Many young newly elected Deputies to this House expect an awful lot better.  We were all told before beforehand that there is a lot of pomp and ceremony around it, and we understand that, but we want to get down to business.  While I understand a Government has to be formed, and we wish that this will happen as quickly as possible, we also want to ensure today and tomorrow that the issues that face the people who put us here are dealt with.  It seems to me and to all of us that this is being deferred.

I would also like to propose two other amendments to motion 5c.  The first is that what is set down as a statement on housing and homelessness for a debate commencing at 6.30 p.m. and to last for two hours, would be brought forward to the start of the business of the day.  It would be the first debate and would conclude after four hours rather than two hours, thereby at least doubling the time, but the debate would also include provision for motions to be proposed to the D&aacute;il and for motions to be adopted by the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  The tsunami of homelessness and the housing crisis that was spoken about in the course of the election campaign has not gone away.  In fact, it has got worse.  All the empirical evidence in terms of people we meet is that the situation continues to worsen on a daily basis.  Those people affected by the crisis, amounting to hundreds of thousands, cannot wait for a Government to be formed to resolve this crisis.  They need action immediately.  That applies to the 1,600 children living in emergency homeless accommodation.  They cannot wait.  It applies also to the 100,000 families on the social housing list.  They cannot wait.  It applies to the tens of thousands facing imminent rent hikes that they cannot afford.  They cannot wait.  In addition, it applies to those facing mortgages they cannot afford.  They cannot wait.  It also applies to the man living in a box 100 m from the D&aacute;il.  He also cannot wait.  We need to have a substantive debate but we also need provision for motions to be proposed and adopted by the D&aacute;il and, in particular, we need emergency action to resolve the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The second concrete proposal is that we believe there should be an additional debate and statements on Irish Water and the water charges.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will support the amendment of the day&rsquo;s business along those lines.  This is the elephant in the room from the point of view of the establishment parties.  It was conspicuously absent from Deputy Martin&rsquo;s listing of priorities.  As a number of speakers have said, the elephant in the room on the one hand is the 70% of people who voted for parties committed to abolition or at least suspension of the water charges, which means there is clearly no longer a mandate for water charges or for Irish Water.  The media have reported a stampede of people cancelling direct debits, tearing up bills and the growing boycott that will force abolition.  It is approximately a year and a half since the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, declared that the Opposition was having its last protest against water charges on 1 November while we were having protests across the country.  We had another protest today.  The people at the ballot box had a very significant protest and I believe there will be another massive protest on the streets of Dublin on a Saturday in a few weeks' time to demand abolition.<\/p>  <p>  It is only a few months since the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, said that he spends 3% to 5% of his time thinking about the water charges.  The evidence would suggest that perhaps he and the Labour Party should have spent  longer thinking about them, the impact they are having on people and on its support.  We need an immediate debate on water charges and Irish Water.  We need it on the next sitting day and we need a recognition that Irish Water and the water charges have to go, but also a recognition by the establishment parties in here that people are not going to wait.  They are not going to place their trust in negotiations between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to see the abolition of water charges.  People are going to act decisively and force abolition and they are going to do so, correctly, by increasing the rate of boycott, by tearing up the bills and by cancelling direct debits, as is currently happening.  That is why we need a debate on Irish Water and the water charges when we return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000033#BBB00600","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1457583300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Before I proceed to the next speaker &ndash; the list of speakers is growing &ndash; could I ask the House if it is in order to accept motion 5<i>b<\/i>, on the issue of D&aacute;il reform and the establishment of a committee?

There are various points one could make but I will make just two.  In the consideration of D&aacute;il reform we should not confine ourselves completely because how the D&aacute;il works relates to how the Seanad works and also relates to the strength of local government.  The decentralisation of power is one of the solutions to the ills of our democracy.  It is a question of more democracy, both in this House and beyond it.  We will not solve issues relating to Seanad reform or further and better local government reform but they should not be excluded from the consideration of how that process will work.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Naughten that we are in exceptional times.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said the situation is not exceptional.  It is not unprecedented, nor is it unique in the sense that there are a number of other countries in Europe and generally across the western world where the political systems are in a very stressed and fearful state because people for a variety of complex reasons are also in a fearful and stressed state.  There is a lot of uncertainty.  That makes these particular circumstances unique, due to the international environment more than anything else.  In those circumstances, on the first day of this new D&aacute;il, we must enter a slight caveat and express a concern.  As Deputy Naughten said, we have no ability to ask questions of Ministers.  Ministers will attend European Council meetings that are addressing highly complex issues.  The Taoiseach will go to the European Council next week to consider migration and other issues that are not everyday issues.  This is not a time when an interim or caretaker Government can easily manage the process while not being in a position to take significant decisions.<\/p><p>If we end up in a situation where the public service is the interim Government and it ends up taking very significant decisions with no proper democratic oversight and, in effect, with no democratic mandate, it is something we will have to keep a very close eye on as we go through this process.  I just wanted to enter that caveat.  It is not unprecedented or unique but I argue that the circumstances are very special, particularly internationally, and require us to take care.  They require that any caretaker Government takes care of any actions it takes and that there is a certain urgency in providing the democratic oversight that is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000033#BBB01300","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1457583900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Ceann Comhairle and wish him every success in his role as Ceann Comhairle of the 32nd D&aacute;il.

In the current circumstances, with the diverse view across the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, reform is needed so that a Government can be formed under a different format to ensure that it reflects the views across the Chamber and finds solutions for the very serious problems that affect both urban and rural Ireland, families, older people and, right across the spectrum, people with disabilities.

That is an important point to make.<\/p><p>I have two other points before I conclude.  A point was made by Deputy Naughten and I wondered why he sidled down to me to ask me whether I had resigned or not.  I did not realise it was to arm himself for his contribution.  I noticed that in two of the debates, there is provision for the Labour Party to participate as a separate entity but in the third debate on housing, there is not.  I do not know if there is a procedural reason the Labour Party should have a view separately from the Government on the European Council meeting and the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting but not on housing.  We need clarity on that.  Perhaps in the circumstances, each political party or grouping would have provision to have a separate view on these matters - because clearly as parties we do - as well as an interim joint Government perspective on them.  <\/p><p>As the T&aacute;naiste indicated earlier, since many amendments have been proposed, I formally propose an amendment to No. 5<i>c<\/i>that immediately after the first paragraph, which states &quot;accordingly the only business to be transacted on that day shall be as follows&quot;, the first business would be a report to the House by the Taoiseach on the progress made on the formation of Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016031000034#CCC00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1457583900,"counter":291,"content":"<p>With respect to ministerial accountability, it is absolutely important that Members have the opportunity to table parliamentary questions.  I concur with the last speaker that the quicker the Government is established, the better.  In the interim period, we have a caretaker Cabinet with Ministers who preside over their respective portfolios and Government Departments.  As health spokesperson prior to the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il, there are key questions that I would like to pose on matters.  I want to know how these matters have progressed over the intervening period.  The same Minister holds that responsibility.  Deputy Naughten has referenced written parliamentary questions and, whether that was intentional or not, I want to be able to pose questions on the continuing stewardship of those Ministers if we find ourselves in any protracted hiatus period.  It should be accommodated in terms of the amendment to No. 5<i>c<\/i>regarding the extended sitting of the D&aacute;il on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  The facility should be there for Ministers to come in and answer questions properly tabled by Members of the House, not on the cut and thrust of policy, but to find out exactly what the position is on certain very important matters.  It is information which I have no other means of extracting.  As a democratically re-elected Member of this House, I want to be able to continue to perform that role of holding to account whoever is at the helm of the Department of Health.

However, it should not be limited to statements.  It has to include the right of parties to have their motions debated and, ultimately, voted on.  Therefore, we should discuss the Sinn F&eacute;in motion on water charges.  We should have a right to put forward a motion on water charges which would place an emphasis on the boycott.
