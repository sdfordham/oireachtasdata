The Survey showed that 61,000 extra jobs had been created in the economy year-on-year compared to Quarter 4 of 2012.  This was the fifth Quarter in succession where employment has grown on an annual basis.  Employment increased in ten of the fourteen economic sectors classified by the CSO.

There are sectors, particularly Construction, Retail and related sectors, that were hit particularly badly by the economic downturn and which have not yet recovered in terms of employment, even since 2011.

Subject to certain conditions set out in that Act, an employer may make a deduction from wages in respect of the cost of goods or services which are necessary to the employment, including, for example, the provision of uniforms.  The Act provides, in particular, that any deduction must be required or authorised to be made by virtue of a term of the contract of employment, and that the employee be furnished with a copy of the relevant contract term.  If that term was not in writing, then notice in writing of the existence and effect of the term must be given to the employee. It further provides that any deduction must be fair and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, including the employee&rsquo;s wages, and should not exceed the cost to the employer of the goods or services.  <\/p><p>  If an employee considers that an employer has not complied with the Payment of Wages Act, a complaint may be made to the Rights Commissioners Service of the Labour Relations Commission. I believe this represents a reasonable and balanced approach.<\/p><p>  As regards the protection of staff in low-paid positions, further to a commitment in the Programme for Government, on 1 July 2011, the National Minimum Wage was restored to &euro;8.65 per hour from the previous rate of &euro;7.65.  This restoration represents a significant commitment by the Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers. <\/p><p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 came into effect on 1 August 2012.  The main purpose of the Act is to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system.  The Act provides for a radical overhaul of the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It reinstates a robust system of protection for low paid and vulnerable workers in sectors which, prior to the July 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case, had been covered by JLCs. On January 28 last I signed Establishment Orders following a Labour Court review of the existing JLCs.   <\/p><p>  As regards zero hours contracts, these contracts must be entered into freely by the employer and the employee &ndash; one cannot be forced upon an employee.  In certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to both employers and employees.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements.  However, this is an area I will keep under review.<\/p><p>  It must be noted that Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 contains a specific protection for employees on zero hour contracts.  The protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  It covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he\/she was requested to work or to be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he\/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he\/she is required to be available, or 15 hours, whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  Claims of breaches of section 18 may be referred to a Rights Commissioner.<\/p><p>  In addition, Sections 17 and 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act may also be of particular interest to employees on zero hour contracts.  Section 17 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he\/she will be required to work during the week, and Section 19 sets out an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to paid annual leave calculated based on hours worked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA01275","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA01338"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[12011\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of female entrepreneurs that have benefitted from the female entrepreneurship competitive feasibility fund; the progress to date in promoting female entrepreneurship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>Both Enterprise Ireland and the County &amp;amp; City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are actively providing a range of supports to women in business including financial supports, sponsorship of awards, business events, promoting role models and specialised training and networking programmes.  30 female led businesses received Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) Competitive Feasibility funding in 2013.

In addition, section 3 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that a dispute between a worker and an employer only arises if it is connected with the employment, non-employment or the terms of the employment or with the conditions of employment of any person.  Legal advice received by the Labour Court on a number of occasions suggests that a person who is retired cannot be regarded as a worker and cannot be party to a trade dispute capable of investigation by the Court. Where a person is retired they cannot have a dispute concerning their employment or non-employment.  The Court is, however, entitled to investigate a matter which arose prior to an individual's retirement and which was referred to the Labour Relations Commission or Labour Court prior to the individual's retirement.<\/p><p>  In the context of work on the draft Workplace Relations Bill, I am currently considering issues which have arisen in the context of the provision of access to individual former employees to the industrial relations machinery of the State under the Industrial Relations Acts, where they have not referred their claim prior to their retirement. Any change in this area would require amendments to the definition of 'worker' within the meaning of section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and to the definition of 'trade dispute' within the meaning of section 3 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.<\/p><p>  I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, that any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board.

In such circumstances a pensioner will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits.<\/p><p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Social Protections have held initial discussions to explore how retired persons could have collective representation with the Trustees of the Pension Schemes of which they are members and, perhaps more problematically, with former employers where changes to the scheme are being negotiated between employers and employees that may impact on retired persons.

As a small open economy, a central tenet of Ireland&rsquo;s economic strategy is the essential requirement to export goods and services. In order for our companies to achieve success on the global market they must be able to innovate at internationally high levels in order to differentiate themselves.<\/p><p>  My Department and its agencies are focused on the development and support of internationally traded manufacturing and services firms in Ireland.  They have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created by prioritising innovation and technology as a key driver of success. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland provide a range of innovation and science\/ technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative and encourage competitiveness.  In turn, this will help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will be maintained and expanded.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs emphasises the importance of Innovation and the use of technology as core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2014 and into the coming years. In tandem with this approach, it is recognised that substantial international expertise and important sources of non-exchequer funding are available via EU research initiatives. Enterprise Ireland is responsible for coordinating Ireland&rsquo;s national support network for helping Irish companies and third level researchers to participate in Horizon 2020.  This is the new EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation covering the period 2014 &ndash; 2020, with a budget of nearly &euro;80 Billion.<\/p><p>  Horizon 2020 offers valuable opportunities to companies based in Ireland to participate in high-quality research collaborations.

Ireland&rsquo;s drawdown from Framework Programme 7, Horizon 2020&rsquo;s predecessor, was almost &euro;600 Million. This funding has provided a considerable increase in the innovative capability of Irish industry and academics over and above existing exchequer investments in this area.<\/p><p>  It is most encouraging to see that the 2014 European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published last week, shows Ireland increasing its position from tenth to ninth in the overall ranking of 28 EU Member States. Moreover, it is particularly encouraging to see that Ireland is the overall leader in the indicator which measures the economic effects of innovation.  This indicator captures the economic success of innovation in employment in knowledge-intensive activities and the contribution of medium and high-tech product exports to the trade balance.  It also captures exports of knowledge-intensive services, sales due to innovation activities and license and patent revenues from selling technologies abroad.  I am confident that, against that background, Ireland will continue to maximize the financial benefits from EU Framework Programmes and will meet the target we have set ourselves for Horizon 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02050"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[12176\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide an update on the negotiations between the EU and the US on a transatlantic trade and investment partnership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":30,"content":"<p>Since TTIP talks started in July 2013, there have been three Rounds of talks, with a further five scheduled during 2014.

The quickest possible removal of tariffs will lower business trading costs and will bring wider competitiveness and consumer benefits. While current tariffs are already low on trade, even these can act as a tax on trade that in reality serves no purpose. This early exchange of offers did not include sensitive agriculture products.

This is the fourth year in a row for jobs growth and there are now over 161,000 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies, the highest ever number recorded in the history of the Agency. <\/p><p><b>Table shows IDA Ireland Employment Data for 2013<\/b><table><tr><th><b>- <\/b><\/th><th><div><b>2013<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>%<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Full Time Jobs<\/td><td><div>142,283<\/div><\/td><td><div>88.31<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other Jobs<\/td><td><div>18,829<\/div><\/td><td><div>11.69<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total Jobs<\/b><\/td><td><div><b>161,112<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Site Visits","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[12013\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of Industrial Development Agency organised visits by prospective investors to sites in County Limerick and in towns outside Limerick city, since 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Within that region, IDA Ireland concentrates its efforts on the Limerick\/Shannon gateway and the hub town of Ennis.  With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a project win in one location in a region has a positive economic impact on other areas within and in close proximity to that region.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county are being developed.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2013, there were 44 IDA Ireland supported companies in Co. Limerick employing 7,284 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites. The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland are from the existing client base.<\/p><p>  In December 2013, I announced that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is to apply for planning permission to establish a state-of-the art, biopharmaceutical production facility within an 11.88 hectare site, previously owned by Dell in the Raheen Business Park, Limerick.  Subject to planning approval from the local authority, the company expects to employ up to 300 people by the end of 2016, including scientists, engineers, technicians and administrative personnel.  The proposed $300 million investment programme will involve the major refurbishment of existing buildings on the site and the construction of a quality control laboratory, which will transform the site into a world-class biopharmaceutical campus.  Subject to a successful permit, construction and refurbishment is anticipated to begin in 2014 for a two year period, generating up to 600 temporary construction jobs for local contractors.  There were a number of other IDA announcements for Limerick during 2013 including Vistakon (300jobs), EtQ (30 jobs) ACI Worldwide (60 jobs) and WWTS (62 jobs).<\/p><p>  In accordance with the Government decision of November 2012, Shannon Development is being merged with Shannon Airport to form a new entity with a commercial mandate in public ownership.  As part of the restructuring of Shannon Development, the enterprise support functions have transferred to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  This will ensure the continuation of support to both FDI and indigenous enterprises in the region and will also allow the new Shannon Group, being formed from the combining of Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development to focus on the development of an International Aviation Service Centre in Shannon.  IDA Ireland is assuming responsibility for FDI companies in the Shannon Free Zone, which currently has approximately 55 companies with over 5,000 employees.  In addition, part of the restructuring will result in IDA purchasing lands in the National Technology Park in Limerick and the Raheen Business &amp;amp; Technology Park from Shannon Development.<\/p><p><b>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits in County Limerick in each of the years 2011 to date in 2014<\/b><table><tr><th><div><b>County<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2011<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2012<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2013<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2014<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(to date)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div><b>Limerick<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>40<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>30<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>23<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div><b>5<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Jobs Data","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02650"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[12228\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA02700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs created by the Industrial Development Agency in each NUTS-II in the last three years; the number lost in IDA assisted businesses broken down on the same basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Since the Oireachtas Committee Report was issued in October 2012, a study undertaken for the European Commission in April 2013 projects that there may be a shortage of ICT professionals of up to 864,000 in Europe by 2015. In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) published a report in November 2013 which projects that there will be more than 44,500 potential job openings for ICT professionals in Ireland over the period from 2013 to 2018, including almost 20,400 potential job openings for both new graduates and skilled professionals between 2013 and 2015.<\/p><p>  Almost half of applications for new Employment Permits during 2013 were from applicants with critical ICT skills, both within and beyond the ICT sector itself. The Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2013 committed to delivering a range of additional measures to streamline and simplify the Employment Permit application process, with shortages in the ICT sector specifically in mind. These have all been delivered.  For example, an ICT Green Card employment permit application may now be made in respect of all sectors of the economy, not just in the ICT sector itself, in recognition that ICT skills are in short supply across the economy. An Intra-Company Transfer Permit holder or a Contract Service Provider Employment Permit holder can now apply for other types of Employment Permits. The &euro;30,000 salary threshold for IT Graduates (both graduates of Irish and foreign colleges) has been reduced to &euro;27,000. This year, the application process is being enhanced by the development of a &lsquo;Trusted Partner Registration Scheme&rsquo; to allow fast tracking of applications.<\/p><p>  The initial pilot phase of the Scheme will be rolled out for employment in selected enterprises that are enterprise agency clients.  Other changes to the application process, which include enhanced call centre support and the introduction an eForm, have reduced processing times for issue of Employment Permits by an average of 36% over the course of 2013. <\/p><p>  The Minister for Education and Skills and I, together with a range of Government agencies and in close collaboration with industry, have developed Ireland's second ICT Skills Action Plan, informed by the progress to date in implementing the measures under the first ICT Action Plan, and the EGFSN Report. The EGFSN report presents new demand scenarios for high level ICT skills to 2018. The ICT Skills Action Plan will bring together actions by industry, education providers and the state sector to meet the challenge of ICT skills shortages, and will be launched by the Minister for Education and Skills and myself tomorrow.  The focus of this new Plan will be on building the supply of graduates and skilled professionals with core ICT\/electronic engineering qualifications at honours degree level and above. Before the publication of the first Action Plan, domestic supply from higher education programmes only meat 45% of demand. That figure is now estimated at over 60% and we are targeting three quarters by 2018.<\/p><p>  Whilst I have no plans to introduce a Technology Permit, I am pleased that the scope of the new ICT Skills Action Plan has been broadened to encompass measures to increase the supply of highly skilled and experienced ICT professionals from abroad, to meet expected skills demand in the short term.  I also intend to bring before the Houses an Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill during this session to underpin an employment permits regime, specifically focussed on plugging skills gaps and minimising their impact on enterprise growth.  I am confident that the changes to the application requirements specific to the Highly Skilled Occupations &ndash; which includes ICT skills - will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination for ICT professionals and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA03050"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[12225\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the introduction of a living wage and its benefits to employers and employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>The UK Living Wage Foundation describe the Living Wage as an hourly rate, set independently and updated annually that is calculated according to the basic cost of living and paid by employers on a voluntary basis. The UK rate promulgated is &pound;7.65 per hour.  Ireland generally operates a voluntarist system of Industrial Relations where terms and conditions are negotiated freely. This has operated well. In addition, Ireland had certain provisions that apply with statutory effect.<\/p><p>  The National Minimum Wage (NMW) in Ireland at &euro;8.65 per hour, is relatively high by international standards. The most recent figures published by Eurostat show that Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fourth highest among the 21 EU Member States that have a National Minimum Wage. When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fifth highest.  In addition to the NMW, Industrial Relations Acts provide a framework within which employers and employee representatives, through the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system, can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector. Pay rates negotiated in the JLC fora tend to be somewhat above the NMW and the JLCs operate in areas where collective bargaining is not well established and wages tend to be low (e.g. hairdressing, and hospitality sectors).<\/p><p>  For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by Employment Regulation Order. For some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry; a flexibility which cannot easily be achieved by primary legislation. Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge that is of benefit to both.  The decision to restore the NMW to &euro;8.65 per hour with effect from 1 July 2011, together with the decision to put the JLC on a more secure legal and constitutional footing and reinstate a robust system of protection for these represents a significant commitment by this Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.<\/p><p>  Alongside these structures, the Department of Social Protection supports low-income families in work by means of Family Income Supplement (FIS).

I should point out that during the period 2010 to 2013, 35% of all FDI announcements related to locations outside of Dublin and Cork while 40% of all IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors were to locations outside of Dublin and Cork.  Furthermore, 72,500 people, roughly 44% of the total employment in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s base of companies, including those that were former clients of Shannon Development, are located outside of Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>  It must also be acknowledged that some locations outside of Dublin and the main urban centres already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.

Membership of the Entrepreneurship Forum consisted of entrepreneurs and academics with representation also from my Department and Enterprise Ireland.  The rationale for establishing the Forum was to take suggestions\/advice from people who have actually taken the entrepreneurial route, have direct experience of the challenges facing entrepreneurs and can provide a relevant insight into the responses needed in the current economic environment.<\/p><p>  The Forum considered all 74 of the submissions from a parallel public consultation process undertaken in 2013 as well as the outcomes from meetings with stakeholders in the development of their Report.  69 recommendations have been put forward by the Forum in their Report. Many of the recommendations require Government action, but there are also recommendations aimed at businesses, entrepreneurs and industry representative bodies to engage them in building a stronger entrepreneurial culture in Ireland.  The Report is an important contribution to our current consideration of new policies to drive entrepreneurship in Ireland.  I am currently considering the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in so far as my own responsibilities are concerned, and I am also consulting with relevant colleagues in Government in respect of their Department&rsquo;s response to the recommendations falling within their respective areas of responsibility.<\/p><p>  The Government have committed to produce a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement within the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014. Through a disruptive reform on entrepreneurship, we have set out a vision for Ireland to be among the most entrepreneurial nations in the world and to be acknowledged as a world-class environment to start and grow a business.  I hope to be in a position to publish the Policy Statement by early Q2 2014.  The Statement will further expand on the rationale, policies and actions set out in the Entrepreneurship chapter in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  It will contain a set of cross-Governmental targeted actions to drive improvements in the overall environment for entrepreneurship, thereby demonstrating our commitment to increasing the prevalence of job creating start-ups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Property Portfolio","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA04250"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[12229\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of agencies under the aegis of his Department that own business or industrial land for development, broken down by agency and by county; if he intends rationalising this approach to the development of industrial and business sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>The two agencies under the remit of my Department who hold industrial property portfolios are IDA Ireland and Shannon Development.  Details of the land holdings of both agencies are set out in the tabular statement.  IDA Ireland also provides property solutions to companies who are clients of Enterprise Ireland.  Under legislation both agencies are independent in the exercise of their property function.  The empirical results of international research has demonstrated that the availability of suitable property solutions is a key element in the location decision making process undertaken by prospective investors in determining where projects will locate.  Most International development agencies with which IDA competes hold substantial stocks of such properties.<\/p><p>  As part of the restructuring of Shannon Development, the enterprise support functions have transferred to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  This will ensure the continuation of support to both FDI and indigenous enterprises in the region and will also allow the new Shannon Group, being formed from the combining of Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development to focus on the development of an International Aviation Service Centre in Shannon.  IDA Ireland is assuming responsibility for FDI companies in the Shannon Free Zone, which currently has approximately 55 companies with over 5,000 employees.  In addition, part of the restructuring will result in IDA purchasing lands in the National Technology Park in Limerick and the Raheen Business &amp;amp; Technology Park from Shannon Development.<\/p><p>  In recent years IDA Ireland has taken the decision to rationalise its non-core land holdings in a number of locations throughout the country.  Land holdings are initially offered to Local Authorities and recent examples of rationalisation of IDA Ireland non-core lands completed include the transfer of lands to Roscommon County Council, Donegal County Council, Wicklow County Council and South Dublin County Council. In addition, current transfers in legal process include Cork County Council, Leitrim County Council, Wexford County Council and discussions are on-going with Galway County Council, Sligo County Council, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and Kilkenny County Council.  The Agency has explained that non-core lands which are not required by the Local Authorities are placed on the Open Market for disposal.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland also markets non-core lands and properties directly to stakeholders including; OPW, HSE, Chambers of Commerce, An Post and other similar bodies through active engagement in sharing portfolio information with common objectives.  IDA constantly keeps its property portfolio under review and of course the matter will again be reviewed in the contest of the work currently being undertaken on the preparation of a new strategy for the Agency from 2015 onwards. <\/p><p><b>Table shows details of IDA Ireland Land Holdings<\/b><table><tr><th><b>County<\/b><\/th><th><b>Property Name<\/b><\/th><th><b>Property Type<\/b><\/th><th><div><b>Net Hectares<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>Bagenalstown <\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.1555<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>Cavan B&amp;amp;T Park<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>12.0745<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Youghal Springfield Estate<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>1.87<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Youghal Foxhole<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>1.2341<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Mallow B &amp;amp; T<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>3.4585<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Macroom Coolcour<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.3976<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Kinsale Rathhallikeen<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.1298<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Fermoy Rathealy <\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.9955<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Cork City Kilbarry B&amp;amp;T Park<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>57.53<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Carrigtohill B&amp;amp;T Park<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>24.297<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Bandon Laragh Estate<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>1.83<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Ringaskiddy (Strategic Site)<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>156.67<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Cork B&amp;amp;T Park<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.83<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Cork City Ringaskiddy Estate<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.2023<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Cork City Rossa Ave<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.1152<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Millstreet IDA Estate <\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.1133<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Fermoy B &amp;amp; T<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>6.05<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>Cork Carrigtohill East (SSi)<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>53.1576<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Donegal Lurganboy<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.872<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Letterkenny Knocknamona<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>1.35<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Letterkenny B &amp;amp; T Park [30 Ha]<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>24.5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Letterkenny Business Pk<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>2.84<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Dublin 24 - Whitestown Ind Est<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.46<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Swords - Barrysparks<\/td><td>Land<\/td><td><div>0.2834<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>Dubl 11 - Poppintree Ind.

It is a novel Scheme in an Irish context and it is currently developing a position in the Irish financial arena.  My Department, along with the CGS operator, Capita, and the participating lenders has committed significant time and resources to the establishment and operation of this Scheme. While demand for the scheme has been lower than anticipated, it has, nonetheless to year end 31 December 2013 supported additional lending of some &euro;9.788 million to 72 companies and supported 409 new jobs, while maintaining 236 jobs.<\/p><p>  The recently completed review of the Scheme has recommended some changes that could lead to increased take-up if they are addressed. We are nearing completion of the review process, having consulted widely with stakeholders on the proposed changes. I will shortly be bringing a Memorandum to Government seeking approval to amend the Credit Guarantee Act and I am confident that the necessary legislative amendments will be made by the Oireachtas in the coming months, with a view to the earliest possible re-launch of the scheme.

The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs contained 270 actions and 92% of these were delivered by the end of that year.  The 2013 Action Plan contained 333 actions and had a 90% implementation rate.  Those commitments which were not implemented on schedule in 2012 and 2013 were carried forward to the subsequent year&rsquo;s Action Plan, or replaced with more targeted measures.<\/p><p>  A key strength of the Action Plan process is its cumulative impact &ndash; each year&rsquo;s Plan builds on measures which have been initiated in the previous year. The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on 27th February and builds on the actions contained in the 2012 and 2013 Plans.  It contains 385 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 agencies.  The Action Plan process is underpinned by a robust monitoring system, with quarterly reports published on progress against key milestones.  All of the Progress Reports since the commencement of the Action Plan for Jobs process are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.djei.ie.<\/p><p>  The latest QNHS data shows that employment has increased in ten of the fourteen economic sectors classified by the CSO.  The largest rates of increase were in:<\/p><p>- Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, which saw an increase of 26,800 jobs;<\/p><p>- Accommodation and Food Services, which saw an increase of 17,400 jobs; and <\/p><p>- Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities, which saw an increase of 13,000 jobs.<\/p><p>These are all sectors which have been identified as having potential for jobs growth under the Action Plan for Jobs process.  Smaller increases were recorded in other sectors, including Industry, Health and Social Work activities, Education, and Administrative services.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s goods exports in 2013 showed a robust performance, and the figures for December 2013 showed an 18% seasonally adjusted increase over December 2012.  In 2013, the Agri-food sector continued to perform well and exports of food and live animals were up 8%, with exports of dairy products increasing by 15%. This performance shows the quality and competitiveness of our agri-business sector and the capacity of that sector to support export-orientated employment across the regions.<\/p><p>  The services sector also continued to perform particularly well, and comprised almost half of Ireland&rsquo;s exports in 2012.  Services exports reached a record level of &euro;90bn in 2012, when our services sector recorded a trade surplus for the first time.  The value of our services exports continued to grow in 2013, with the latest available figures, for September 2013, showing a 4% increase on September 2012.  I understand that updated trade figures are due to be published by the Central Statistics Office today.<\/p><p>  I am not in a position to provide complete data on the number of new start-ups by region, but Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial and non-financial supports to assist clients through all stages of the business development cycle, including offers to High Potential Start-Up (HPSUs) companies.  In 2013, Enterprise Ireland invested in 189 new HPSU companies by way of Equity and through the Competitive Start Funds.  Table 1 shows the regional breakdown of these approvals.  The County and City Enterprise Boards also provide supports to those who wish to start up a business.<\/p><p>  The latest KBC Ireland\/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index was released last week and showed continued improvement, increasing to 85.5 in February 2013, from 84.6 in January and 59.4 in February 2012. The 3-month moving average increased for the tenth consecutive month, to 83.3, from 78.5 in January.  The indications from this are that consumers are increasingly confident that the Irish economy as a whole is improving.<\/p><p>  As we said two years ago when we published the first Action Plan for Jobs, there is no &lsquo;big bang&rsquo; solution to the employment crisis &ndash; what we need is to systematically build a sustainable growing economy which can create the jobs we need.  Over the past two years we have implemented over 500 actions to improve our competitiveness, support Irish and multinational companies, and target sectors of potential.  We are seeing the results of our efforts &ndash; our competitiveness rankings are improving, our exports are growing, and we are now creating jobs faster than any other economy in the EU or the OECD.  We will continue the process in 2014 with the Action Plan for Jobs and other Government policies, so that we fulfil our promises to the many people around the country still have yet to see evidence of economic recovery in their own lives.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Enterprise Ireland investment in HPSUs by region<\/b><table><tr><th><div><b>Region<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>No. of approvals 2013<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Dublin\/Mid-East<\/b><\/td><td><div>119<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Midlands<\/b><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Mid-West<\/b><\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>North East\/North West<\/b><\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>South\/South East<\/b><\/td><td><div>31<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>West<\/b><\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL<\/b><\/td><td><div><b>189<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA04850"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[12170\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA04900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he expects to see jobs created in the manufacturing and services sectors over the next two years; if he is satisfied regarding the availability of skills in the labour force to meet market requirements; the degree to which specific skills are likely to become sought after in the period in question; if any particular skill shortages have been identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>The Forf&aacute;s Strategy for the Manufacturing Sector, which I commissioned, and which was published in April last, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016.  A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.<\/p><p>  Arising from both the Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i> for 2013 and 2014.  A key initiative which is underway is the development of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms.  For 2014 it is intended to undertake the following:<\/p><p>- Support 130 indigenous companies with an initiative to improve their productivity as part of the National Step Change for Manufacturing;<\/p><p>- Deliver a transformation programme across 70 foreign-owned manufacturing and services companies in Ireland to achieve technology uplift, skills enhancement, energy improvements and investment in new facilities and equipment, and<\/p><p>- Support the adoption of LEAN manufacturing and other productivity enhancing measures across a wide range of enterprises including relevant micro-enterprises.<\/p><p>  In relation to that Skills report, it identified some key areas where up-skilling will be required, including shortages of toolmakers, a growing future demand for polymers technicians, and up-skilling requirements for machinists and a range of other specialisms. On foot of these recommendations, work is underway by key stakeholders such as <i>Solas, Skillnets<\/i> and other educational bodies to implement a range of specific skills actions. In addition, a comprehensive review of the Apprenticeship system has just been completed by the Department of Education and Skills.  Its recommendations take account of the major changes to the structure of the economy and the nature of employment since the current system of Apprenticeships was implemented in early 1990s. A consultation process with stakeholders is now underway to examine how implementation of this report can be progressed as quickly as possible. In relation to overall employment in the manufacturing sector, when account is taken of indirect jobs, the sector now supports over 400,000 employees.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Services sector, this accounts for two thirds of total employment in Ireland. While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the job creation trend is very positive. The various <i>Action Plans for Jobs, including t<\/i>he recently published Action<i> Plan for Jobs 2014<\/i> have included a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established services companies to grow, including International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing\/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services.<\/p><p>  In addition, the <i>Medium Term Economic Strategy<\/i>, published last year, has identified the Services Sector as a key driver of job creation and growth.  That Strategy highlights the opportunities in a range of sectors.  It is notable that the latest employment data shows that, across all sectors, an additional 61,000 people were in work at the end of 2013, compared with one year ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300050#WRA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":73,"content":"<p>Question No. 33 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":74,"content":"<p>Question No. 34 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Missions","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[12014\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will report on the recent joint trade mission carried out in Singapore by his Department and Enterprise Ireland and counterparts from the United Kingdom; and if similar missions will take place elsewhere this year or in the coming years.","asker":"1020","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[7990\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide a full account of the first joint trade mission by Ireland and Britain to the Singapore Air Show; his plans for further joint trade missions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1011","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 40 together. <\/p><p>  As part of a wider trade and investment mission to Singapore and Malaysia, I recently led the first-ever joint trade mission of Irish, Northern Ireland and British companies, together with fellow Ministers Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and Stephen Hammond, UK Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport.

A joint trade stand allowed the Irish and British participants to demonstrate their individual and joint capabilities.<\/p><p>  The joint trade mission arises from a commitment by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister David Cameron at their annual Summit last March. Closer economic and trading ties between Ireland and Britain, including strengthening British and Irish firms' abilities to win new business in third countries, forms part of a wider agenda aimed at strengthening British-Irish relations over the next ten years, as agreed at a Leaders' Summit in March 2012.  The Irish companies participating in the joint mission supply goods and services in a variety of sub-sectors in the aviation industry such as training, recruitment, plastic components, precision tooling, crew management, transport logistics and airport management.<\/p><p>  As well as participating directly in the air show, the companies attended a round- table discussion where aviation experts in the region gave an overview of developments and opportunities, and a site visit to a large aircraft overhaul and maintenance operator.<\/p><p>  The ASEAN region with a population of 600 million people, is a key growth area with enormous potential for Irish companies to grow exports and jobs across a variety of sectors, including aviation.

The challenges facing SMEs in Ireland accessing credit are the product of a complex interplay of demand and supply side factors.\u00a0 Demand factors are clearly critical in determining the relative lack of credit extended to SMEs in Ireland, particularly for those businesses that are operating within the domestic sector.<\/p><p>  Reduced demand for credit has been reaffirmed in a series of independent credit demand surveys that have been commissioned by the Department of Finance since 2010.\u00a0 The most recent Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey highlighted that the marked improvement in trading conditions with improved turnover, profit and staffing across different sizes and types of SMEs has not, as yet, translated into an increase in demand for credit.\u00a0 The next credit demand survey will begin at the end of March 2014 and will cover the six month period October 2013 to March 2014.  In order to support SMEs the Government has developed a suite of State-sponsored financing instruments that provide a broader range of capital, equity and debt funding across all stages of the business cycle.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, measures to promote access to finance amongst SMEs, including measures relating to debt restructuring, are a central feature of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2014.\u00a0 The APJ 2014 includes an integrated action plan that includes a series of measures designed to:<\/p><p>  -  Increase new lending <\/p><p>  -  Increase participation in Government sponsored initiatives<\/p><p>  -  Develop new sources of funding<\/p><p>  -  Increase awareness of Government measures and initiatives to support SMES and <\/p><p>  -  Enhance the financial capability of SMEs.  \u00a0<\/p><p>    Debt overhang and SME arrears are issues which impact on the ability of a SME to meet its existing commitments as well as hindering its ability to secure additional credit which it may need.  In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term forbearance solutions.\u00a0 The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.\u00a0 The Central Bank has informed me that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets to date.\u00a0 This perspective has been reaffirmed by both the IMF and the European Commission who report that the<b><\/b>workout of SME arrears is progressing and that imposed targets are being met. <\/p><p>  Irish banks are well advanced in restructuring their SME loan books.\u00a0 Bank of Ireland indicated in their recently published results that they had reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases.\u00a0 Similarly the AIB's results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.\u00a0 It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year-on-year.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state and will continue in 2014. Additionally, the Government's decision to fast track legislation to allow small companies (as defined by the Companies Acts) to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership, the Irish Banking Federation's new Protocol on Multi Banked SME debt and the on going work of the expanded Credit Review Office are all initiatives that will assist viable SMEs in addressing their debt situation. <\/p><p>  I should stress that the Credit Review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland as well as when credit is refused by them. I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.<\/p><p>  In conclusion the Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as key engine of ongoing economic recovery and growth.\u00a0 Consequently the Department, working with the other relevant departments and agencies, will continue to monitor both the availability of credit and the process of debt management with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade in Tobacco","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[12479\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total number of fines issued to importers of illicit tobacco products and sellers of illicit tobacco products for each of the years, 2011, 2012 and 2013; the total value of fines issued in monetary value for each of the years; the number of such fines that were paid in each of the years; the total value in monetary value of such fines that were paid in each of the years; the amount in monetary value of outstanding fines for each of the years; if he is satisfied with the level of compliance with such fines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that numbers of fines imposed in the years in question in respect of offences relating to illicit tobacco products, and the total values of those fines, are as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>-<div>\u00a0<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012<\/div><\/th><th><div>2013<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>No. of cases in which \u00a0fines were imposed<\/td><td><div>118<\/div><\/td><td><div>92<\/div><\/td><td><div>62<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total value of fines imposed<\/td><td><div>&euro;253,150<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;248,100<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;165,750<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are not responsible for the collection of fines imposed by the Courts and would not have details about their payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[12485\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300051#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will revise the current VAT and duty tax on diesel to assist commercial transport companies who are currently finding it difficult to sustain business due to the considerable hikes in fuel costs; if he will consider offering them a rebate system similar to that available to airline and ferry companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>The Energy Tax Directive obliges all Member States to exempt jet fuel used by airlines and fuel used by shipping in Community waters from duty, but does not allow for a similar exemption to be applied to fuel used by road transport operators.

The most notable difference involves the interest rate charged on the warehoused element of the split mortgage while the maximum amount that can be warehoused is dependent on each lender's own internal criteria.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  The split mortgage, like all other forbearance and modification arrangements, is based on affordability and sustainability of the arrangement from both the borrower and the lender's perspective.\u00a0 There is also a commercial and contractual leeway for the lender in formulating the details of any particular restructure or alternative repayment arrangement from the initial contractual requirements.\u00a0 The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) however cannot mandate that a lender must provide one particular solution, or the terms of one particular solution, as opposed to another.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  As lenders offer split mortgages with differing terms and conditions, the main supervisory issue is one of transparency and the Central Bank is of the view that all lenders should make public all terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for a &quot;split mortgage&quot; to aid both customers and financial advisors.\u00a0 In addition, the CCMA will require the lender, where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered, to outline the reasons why the alternative arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable, as well as the advantages and any disadvantages or potential disadvantages of any arrangement offered, in the context of the individual circumstances of the borrower.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  The new monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.\u00a0 For example, based on data published by my Department in respect of the MART institutions, the number of permanent restructures of primary dwelling houses (PDH) more than 90 days in arrears has risen from around 41,200 in August to around 54,000 at the end of January.\u00a0 The data also indicates that at end January,\u00a07,131 split mortgages\u00a0were put in place in respect of primary home mortgages and a further 384 in respect of buy to let mortgages (this data includes those split mortgages which are initially proposed for a short-term trial period).  \u00a0<\/p><p>  The necessary framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.\u00a0\u00a0Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.\u00a0 Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.\u00a0 However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300052#WRC00200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Customs and Excise Staff","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300052#WRC00250"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[12538\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300052#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of customs and excise officials who work at Ireland West Airport, Knock; if they work there on a full-time or part-time basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  There is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for pensioners under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), though such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  \u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Thornhill Group considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship.  As a general principle, eligibility for deferral should be based on gross income.  The system of deferrals in place is targeted at cases of need, where there is an inability to pay the local property tax under specific conditions.\u00a0 I have specifically provided in Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) for\u00a0a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.\u00a0 These deferral arrangements also take account of mortgage interest payments made by the property owner.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a person whose only income is a DSP payment will qualify for a deferral of LPT.\u00a0 However, if a person has income in addition to any DSP payment, they will qualify for deferral if their gross annual income is less than &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple.  They would qualify to defer 50% of their LPT charge where their gross annual income is less than &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for a couple and the remaining 50% of the tax must be paid.  Where the property was purchased with a mortgage, these income thresholds are increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments.\u00a0 Specific examples of how the deferral arrangements work are provided on the Revenue website at .  \u00a0<\/p><p>  For those who qualify for deferral but do not wish to defer their payment, or those who do not qualify for deferral because they do not meet the necessary criteria, Revenue has provided a wide range of payment options which enables property owners to select a payment option that suits their particular circumstances.  Options include spreading payments over the course of the year by deduction at source from their DSP payment, by monthly direct debits through certain credit union accounts or their bank account or, by making regular weekly or monthly payments to one of the three payment service providers which are An Post, Payzone and Omnivend.  Details of the costs payable to the three service providers are set out on the Revenue website at.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  I am advised that further information on deferral of LPT as well as details of other payment methods are available by calling the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300052#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300052#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[12617\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300052#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"with regard to legislation that is in place to allow disabled persons to avail of a VAT and VRT exception on modified vehicles, if legislation will be introduced to allow these persons to purchase motor cars over 2 litres in engine size, which was the case in the past.

The Central Bank's statistics on SME lending provides a breakdown of outstanding debt across a number of different industries. \u00a0SME credit to non-property, non-financial private-sector enterprises fell by 6.2 per cent (&euro;1.6 billion) in the year to end-Q4 2013, to stand at &euro;24.5 billion.  This represents a decline of 3.1 per cent (&euro;771 million) over the quarter as these SMEs continued to repay more debt than was drawn down.  SMEs accounted for 67 per cent of all non-financial, non-property credit.\u00a0 The Central Bank does not publish figures on arrears or non-performing loans specific to the SME Sector.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  In June 2013 the Central Bank set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer-term forbearance solutions.\u00a0 The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.\u00a0 The Central Bank has informed the Minister for Finance that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets to date.\u00a0 This perspective has been reaffirmed by both the IMF and the European Commission who report that the<b><\/b>workout of SME arrears is progressing and that imposed targets are being met.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  Irish banks are well advanced in restructuring their SME loan books.\u00a0 Bank of Ireland indicated in their recently published results that they had reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases.\u00a0 Similarly the AIB's results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.\u00a0 It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year-on-year.\u00a0 Given the scale of the economic crisis that was inherited by this Government this clearly represents considerable progress in such a vital sector of the economy.  \u00a0<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state and will continue in 2014.

The mandate for the ISIF will be to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  This means the ISIF will have a dual objective   both investment return and economic impact - and there is little precedent for sovereign funds globally investing with such a &quot;double bottom line&quot;, although a number of such funds are beginning to emerge.<\/p><p>  In recent months, the NTMA, in consultation with the Department of Finance and a number of other Government Departments and Agencies, has been developing a new Economic Impact Framework, which will be a key element of the ISIF Business Plan.  The ISIF Business Plan will be approved in due course by the new NTMA Board. The Economic Impact Framework will seek to identify target areas for investment which have higher potential economic and employment impact, and will also facilitate the identification of categories of investment that would be expected to assist and accelerate normalsation of capital markets in Ireland post the financial crisis.  It is expected that the ISIF's investment strategy will involve a combination of investment through funds (such as the SME funds and China Ireland Technology Fund that the NPRF has committed to) and directly (such as the NPRF's participation in recent PPP projects and in the pre start-up stage financing of Irish Water).  An important element of the ISIF strategy will be where possible for the ISIF to be a cornerstone investor, thereby acting as a catalyst for additional third party investors.  This will significantly increase the economic impact that can be achieved in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Because of uncertainty regarding the nature of opportunities that emerge or can be developed, it is not clear at this stage what will be the nature and shape of the ISIF's ultimate investment portfolio and the quantum of co-investment that can be achieved.  There will also be a time lag between the NPRF\/ISIF commitment and when the economic impact takes place.  Therefore it is not feasible at this stage to estimate in advance what the economic activity and employment impacts of the ISIF may be.  The ISIF Business Plan and the new NTMA Board are expected to address this issue.  In the interim, the NTMA is developing its capabilities for collating and analysing data to measure and report on economic impact on an ex-post basis (i.e. after the investment has been made).  This will require a completely new data set to be sought and reported on by funds and the underlying companies in which funds have invested and by companies or project sponsors in which the NPRF has invested directly.  While it is standard practice that companies report financial information to their investors, the new ISIF mandate will also require metrics that can be used to help assess economic impact to be reported.  The NTMA expects to be able to publish a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland by the NPRF during the second quarter of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300053#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Resident Companies","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300053#WRD00450"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[12684\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300053#WRD00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of Irish incorporated companies that are not judged to be resident here under the test of management and control and that have advised the Revenue Commissioners as to where they are actually resident since the change announced in budget 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is important to state clearly that such companies are not paying a low rate of Irish tax.\u00a0 All companies operating in Ireland, whether they are domestic businesses or multinationals, are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here. A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p><p>  The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets, owned by group companies that are not resident in Ireland.  It is incorrect to relate the 12.5% corporation tax rate to both the profits of the Irish-resident group companies and the profits of non-resident group companies  which are not profits chargeable to Irish corporation tax.\u00a0 By mixing up the Irish profits and the foreign profits of multinational groups like this, these reports can produce an average tax rate for the companies concerned that is lower than 12.5%   and an incorrect inference that the full Irish profits are not being charged.<\/p><p>  From an Irish perspective, we ensure that the profits arising in Ireland are taxed at our 12.5% rate of corporation tax.\u00a0 We do not seek to charge profits properly attributable to other jurisdictions.  The ability of entities to lower their world-wide rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.\u00a0 Differences arise in the legal and tax systems between countries.\u00a0 International tax-planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules.\u00a0 The best way to combat such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.<\/p><p>  The appropriate action is being considered in this regard by the OECD as part of their project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Ireland is participating fully in this process.  To demonstrate our commitments in this regard, on Budget Day last year, I published Ireland's International Tax Strategy, which can be viewed on the Department's website.\u00a0 This document sets out our commitments in relation to international tax and highlights our strong support for global action to address harmful tax competition.\u00a0 Ireland is very active in international fora that deal with these issues, such as the OECD's Forum on Harmful Tax Practices and the EU Code of Conduct Group.  Ireland wants to be part of the solution to this global tax challenge, not part of the problem.\u00a0 That is why I introduced a change last year in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 which amended \u00a0Ireland's company tax residence rules to ensure that an Irish-registered company cannot be 'stateless' in terms of its tax residency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300053#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Payments","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300053#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[12737\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300053#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a person who is employed in another country (details supplied) who is liable to pay &euro;8,000 under the universal social charge in this State per year must pay a second preliminary tax of &euro;8,000 up-front for next year, even though they are an employee and not self-employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In general, students who previously pursued a course of study are not eligible for assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level.  The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree. <\/p><p>  Postgraduate students are not entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme.  Those who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.  A postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.  The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2013\/14 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents. <\/p><p>  The Free Fees Schemes do not extend to postgraduate study.  However, where a student is unemployed they may qualify under the Springboard programme which targets funding of free part-time flexible higher education courses up to master's degree level for unemployed and previously self-employed people in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities.  Springboard places are open to unemployed people who have a previous history of employment and there is no requirement that a person be progressing on the National Framework of Qualifications.  Further information on Springboard, including a list of courses that are currently open for application, is available on the dedicated information and applications website: www.springboardcourses.ie.<\/p><p>  Where students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees Schemes or do not qualify under the Springboard programme, they must pay the appropriate tuition fee as determined by the third level institution.  Such institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, the level of fees to be charged is a matter for the institutions.

The Examiner has not yet concluded this process.  It should be noted that as Examinership is a judicial process, I have no function as Minister.<\/p><p>  Examinership is the main debt restructuring system for companies in Ireland and has been in existence since 1990.  Examinership allows for the rescue of companies that find themselves insolvent but have the potential to return to financial viability and continue in operation into the future.  The key feature of the process is a period of court protection, lasting up to 100 days, during which no one may institute proceedings against the company or petition for the company to be wound up.  The Examiner uses this time to devise a scheme of arrangement, in consultation with creditors, the company management, potential investors and any other parties that would be affected by that scheme.  The scheme of arrangement is then put to the court.  If a majority of the company&rsquo;s creditors agree and the court approves, it becomes binding.<\/p><p>  I believe that Examinership is a good option for companies that have real prospects for the future but find themselves in financial difficulty at a point in time.  It is also a balanced procedure, taking into account both the interests of the ailing company and the rights of the creditors, and giving the courts a role in ensuring a fair and appropriate outcome.  For that reason, the Oireachtas enacted the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 late last year, to allow small private companies to apply for Examinership directly in the Circuit Court, rather than having to go first to the High Court.  I hope that this will make Examinership an option for more companies in the future.  In the meantime, I am keeping the law on Examinership under review to identify if there are any other ways in which we can make it less costly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300055#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Microenterprise Loan Fund Expenditure","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300055#WRF01050"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[12547\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300055#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the set up and running costs of Microfinance Ireland; the amount Microfinance Ireland has lent to business to date and on an annualised basis; the amount of income Microfinance Ireland has generated since its inception; if value for money has been achieved for the taxpayer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The foreign direct investment missions arranged by IDA Ireland typically involve meeting with Chairpersons, CEOs and other senior executives of leading companies, across all sectors.  Some of the companies which I met during 2013 already had substantial and valuable activities in Ireland and those meetings focussed on retaining, expanding and further embedding their presence here.  For companies who do not have a presence in Ireland, the focus was to underpin Ireland as a location for the proposed investment against intense competition from other locations around the world.  In addition to the foreign direct investment missions organised by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland organises a series of targeted international trade missions, focussed on assisting Irish firms target and secure international contracts and overseas partners.<\/p><p>  Both agencies see the Ministerial-led missions as key marketing tools.  They provide, at first hand, an opportunity for the Minister to reinforce the Irish Government&rsquo;s commitment to both foreign direct investment and export-led growth.  In the case of both foreign direct investment missions and trade missions, it is not possible to establish a direct relationship between the number of jobs created or investment secured in any one year to the discussions\/marketing undertaken in that year.  However, the positive impact of our overseas activity can be seen in the overall jobs statistics for agency client companies in 2013.  IDA client companies created a total of 13,367 jobs during 2013.  The net number of new jobs created at 7,071 represented the fourth consecutive year of growth in net employment, while the total number of persons employed in IDA client companies stands at a historical high of 161,112.  In 2013 Enterprise Ireland client company employment totalled more than 175,000 on a full and part time basis, representing a growth of 5,442 jobs in the year.<\/p><p>  The importance of our overseas activity has been highlighted in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs by the inclusion of a new Disruptive Reform entitled Winning Abroad.  Under the Action Plan, the Government will: Target the creation of an additional 10,000 new jobs (6000 direct and 4000 indirect) over 5 years through an investment programme which will see the provision of additional resources to IDA Ireland to be deployed overseas including in emerging markets, intensifying FDI employment growth; Increase support for companies seeking to trade internationally, through the provision of additional on-the-ground support by Enterprise Ireland in overseas markets including China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates and South Africa.  This will also include targeting 650 companies to have significant engagement with the Enterprise Ireland potential exporters division, working with 55 first time exporters and providing a range of programmes to exporters in 2014; Develop the capabilities of Irish enterprises to grow exports through programmes aimed at both existing exporters and potential exporters; Promote Ireland&rsquo;s image abroad to drive increased trade, tourism and investment and implement Local Market Plans in priority markets; and undertake targeted initiatives in sectors including international education services, engineering services and cultural services and design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300055#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300055#WRF01750"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[12691\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300055#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total number of jobs created in the services sector in each of the past three years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS), which is published by the Central Statistics Office, provides a breakdown of employment by economic sector.

However, the sector has seen a modest return to growth in employment over the last few years, with an additional 8,000 jobs having been created in the last year alone.  In relation to overall employment in the manufacturing sector, when account is taken of indirect jobs, the sector now supports over 400,000 employees.  It is not possible to give a breakdown of manufacturing job numbers created nationally in the very specific format requested by the Deputy.  The Forf&aacute;s Strategy for the Manufacturing Sector, which I commissioned and which was launched in April last, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016.  A complementary report was also published in relation to skills needs by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s.<\/p><p>  Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the series of <i>Action Plans for Jobs<\/i>.  One of the key actions is to deliver a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multi-nationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.<\/p><p>  The services sector accounts for two-thirds of total employment in Ireland.  While many of these firms are not in receipt of State support, in respect of those that are, there has been a positive trend in job creation recently with 6,372 new full-time services jobs being created by enterprise agency supported companies since 2012.  In relation to the indigenous sector, Enterprise Ireland client companies created 18,033 new jobs in 2013, a net increase of 5,442 jobs.  Indigenous companies like these account for more than 300,000 jobs in the economy which equates to about 15% of the total workforce.<\/p><p>  Regarding the position on costs generally, the <i>2014 Action Plan for Jobs<\/i> places a particular focus on improving competitiveness in all areas of economic activity and contains a range of specific measures which will deliver further improvements in our international competitiveness performance.  These measures include the regular monitoring of competitiveness issues by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs, which will consider specific initiatives to make it easier to do business in Ireland.  The Government will receive a report from the Cabinet Committee on a quarterly basis on these issues.  Other competitiveness measures in the Action Plan for Jobs cover improving cost competitiveness, supporting competitive regions, aligning skills with enterprise needs and using research and innovation to drive job creation.<\/p><p>  In relation to jobs created in County Kildare in the manufacturing and services sectors over the last three years, such data is not readily available.  However, non sector-specific details of jobs created and lost by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the County Enterprise Board, in each individual county, over recent years, were supplied by me in the reply to Parliamentary Question 47719\/13 dated 12 November 2013, to which I would again refer the Deputy.  This data obviously excludes jobs created outside the remit of the Enterprise Agencies.  I am confident that the measures currently underway will help develop and grow both the manufacturing and services sectors in Ireland which, in turn, will lead to sustainable employment and a reduction in the live register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300055#WRF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[12693\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which grant aid from the EU Commission under the heading of innovation, science and technology continues to be made available to small and medium sized enterprises in both the manufacting and services sectors throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It also indicates that business costs in Ireland have reduced significantly in recent years, with overall price levels in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002.  The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by significant reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services. There have also been relative improvements in labour costs in Ireland, which fell on average by 0.9% per annum in the period 2008-2011 while labour costs increased in the euro area by 4.6% per annum on average in the same period.

We have, nonetheless, seen a marked improvement from the 14,500 jobs lost in this age cohort in Quarter 4 2011, and the 10,600 jobs lost in that cohort in Quarter 4 2012.  The QNHS figures also show that in the year to Quarter 4 2013, the number of people who were long-term unemployed decreased by 20,900.  This is reflected in a drop in the long term unemployment rate from 8.2% to 7.2% year-on-year.  We need to continue to build on this progress and ensure that we get as many people as possible back to work across all age groups and all regions. <\/p><p>  Specifically in relation to County Kildare, in 2013 IDA Ireland created 309 jobs, Enterprise Ireland created 534 jobs and over 300 full-time and part-time jobs were created or sustained through supports provided by Kildare County Enterprise Board. <\/p><p>  Clearly, the best way to address the needs of the long-term and youth unemployed is to continue our efforts to support job creation and help those who are unemployed to get back to work. The Government continues to work on these objectives through the combined efforts of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  There are a number of actions in both strategies which are targeted at, or amenable to, younger people and the long term unemployed.  These include the JobBridge programme, the Youth Guarantee, the Momentum and Springboard training courses, and the ICT Action Plan.  These initiatives are collectively delivered by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  <\/p><p>  The Government is taking steps to increase the number of places and make other enhancements to those schemes for younger people, where possible.  For instance, the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment to ring-fence 2,000 places for people under 25 years of age under the new iteration of the Momentum programme this year.  The JobsPlus Initiative, which was launched last year, also provides a financial incentive to employers to recruit people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more.   <\/p><p>  For my own Department&rsquo;s part, we are putting a particular focus this year on supporting entrepreneurship, and will increase the range of supports available to entrepreneurs, including young entrepreneurs.  The Local Enterprise Offices which will be established next month and rolled out during the year will be the local hub for enterprise support, delivering a comprehensive &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; service to local entrepreneurs and businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":262,"content":"<p>Question No. 100 answered with Question No. 94.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":263,"content":"<p>Question No. 101 answered with Question No. 99.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permit Criteria","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[12701\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which persons employed here on a long term basis on foot of work permits but in some of which cases, gaps have appeared in respect of continuity which was not the responsibility of the employee; if he is satisfied that adequate steps are being taken to ensure that such persons have their status updates\/upgraded as required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The onus to maintain a current immigration status rests on the non-EEA national that may be the subject of a work permit application. An individual&rsquo;s immigration status has a major bearing on the consideration of all classes of employment permit applications, but consideration of issues relating to the immigration status of individuals falls to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Services (INIS) under the Minister for Justice and Equality.  My Department has no role in that process.<\/p><p>  If an individual holds consecutive valid employment permits and maintains his or her immigration status over a five year period he or she may apply to INIS for an immigration Stamp 4 that allows him or her to work in this country without a permit. I understand from the Minister for Justice and Equality that interruptions to an individual&rsquo;s permit history or immigration status can adversely affect consideration by the Minister for Justice of an individual&rsquo;s application for such a stamp.  <\/p><p>  I am aware of a small number of historical cases - going back ten years &ndash; whereby an individual&rsquo;s immigration status expired whilst a permit application was being processed. I understand that, in these historical cases, the late submission of renewal applications by the individuals&rsquo; employer was a contributory factor in the delay experienced.  I am satisfied that, in the intervening ten years, adequate steps have been taken to ensure that the risk of such a situation arising again has been minimised.  For example, changes introduced in the 2006 Employment Permits Act, whereby the employment permit now issues directly to the employee (not, as was previously the case, to the employer),  give the employee more control over the process and he or she is fully aware of the duration and expiry of the permit itself. <\/p><p>  Nonetheless, the onus for maintaining his\/her immigration status up to date rests on the individual in all cases. There is an extensive range of information available on the websites of both INIS and my Department clearly advising applicants that this is the case. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s website and all application forms inform the applicant that renewal application forms must be submitted within a reasonable period before the permit expiry date in order to ensure that an employee&rsquo;s permit history remains unbroken. <\/p><p>  In the past, processing times could run to months.  I am satisfied that, due to ongoing improvements and efficiencies introduced in the Employment Permits Section of my Department, such lengthy processing times are a thing of the past.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that current processing times run to weeks not months, with the average wait time in February 2014 being 14 business days. <\/p><p>  I would also assure the Deputy that there is a close and ongoing working relationship between the Employment Permits Section of my Department and INIS, and both Sections work together to resolve issues pertaining to residency and employment permits where they arise.  In addition to the changes already introduced, the Employment Permits Bill (2014), which I intend to publish shortly and introduce in the Houses in this session, will provide for an employment permit for individuals who had been in possession of an employment permit, but through no fault of their own, have fallen out of the system. <\/p><p>  Thus I am satisfied that the steps outlined above that have been taken by my Department in recent years &ndash; both legislatively and administratively &ndash; and the new permit type I am introducing in the upcoming Bill, together with the ongoing close working relationship we have with INIS, address the concerns expressed by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Repayments Issues","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01550"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[12593\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when the present mortgage interest supplement system finishes, the measures she proposes to introduce to ensure that such a system will be continued to enable, struggling families to continue to meet their mortgage repayments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. There are currently approximately 8,900 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;17.9 million for in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Government wants to provide an environment where mortgage holders can pay for and stay in their home but, where people have a genuine difficulty in meeting their financial commitments, they will have a framework to address and resolve that difficulty in an appropriate and fair way having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:<\/p><p>  -  Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers.<\/p><p>  -  A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent).<\/p><p>  -  Comprehensive advice to borrowers.<\/p><p>  -  Personal Insolvency Reform. <\/p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions. The Keane Group&rsquo;s over-arching theme was that the mortgage interest supplement scheme is not an appropriate long term support and should become a time bound payment with an appropriate exit strategy to be formulated for the recipient.<\/p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme over a four year period, up to 1 January 2018. It is expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support as sustainable solutions are put in place dealing with their mortgage difficulties including securing employment and exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme. <\/p><p>  Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, lenders are obliged to put in place Arrears Support Units to deal with borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing short term mortgage difficulties is through engagement with their lender under this process. Lenders must explore all options for repayment arrangements in order to determine which options are viable for each particular case.  These options include interest only arrangements and deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period. <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the range of supports implemented by this Government, including the range of information and guidance resources available, are appropriate in assisting those facing mortgage difficulties following the discontinuance of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01750"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[12466\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300056#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when the appeal against the disallowance of carer&rsquo;s allowance will be decided in respect of a person(details supplied) in Dublin 13.

Should a customer continue to refuse to take up a reasonable offer under various schemes, the Department may take steps to penalise the jobseeker by reducing the value of the jobseeker's weekly payment. <\/p><p>  While I have no proposals to alter the operational arrangements for T&uacute;s or Gateway, the Department monitors the operation of all programmes and schemes on an ongoing basis and will alter arrangements where these are considered necessary to achieve the objectives set by the Government.  Advice on the opportunities across a range of work placement, internships, self-employment, training and educational supports and options can be accessed via the Department&rsquo;s offices and Intreo service and further information is available on the Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; . <\/p><p>  While 3,000 places have been allocated to Local Authorities under Gateway, to date progress on the roll-out has been slower than anticipated.

","asker":"969","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began  in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension (contributory) pension was reduced to 66 years. <\/p><p>  In the context of State pension reforms, and in order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, a number of other reforms to State pensions have recently been introduced as follows:<\/p><p>  -  With effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.<\/p><p>  -  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p><p>  -  As announced in Budget 2012, the period for which a claim for State pension can be backdated is six months.  This change came into effect in April 2012.<\/p><p>  -  From December 2013, the number of paid contributions required for Widow&rsquo;s\/Widower&rsquo;s\/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s pension increased from 156 contributions to 260 contributions. <\/p><p>  Following considerable policy analysis, it is planned to introduce a &ldquo;total contributions approach&rdquo; to determine eligibility for a State pension.  The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change.  The OECD Review of the Irish Pensions System published in April 2013 will also inform future pension reform over the coming years.<\/p><p>  Following the abolition of State pension transition, for those who may be impacted all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.   The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years). Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history. <\/p><p>  There are two other related provisions; one provides that, in the case of a job seeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year. A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of job seekers benefit within the past year <\/p><p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2014, I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements for older jobseekers, i.e. those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 or over will be placed on yearly signing and will be given the option of transferring to EFT payments. Furthermore, they will not be subject to mandatory activation measures but may avail of employment supports which will continue to be available to them and they will not be subject to activation-related sanctions.<\/p><p>  Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300059#WRK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":356,"content":"<p>Question No. 138 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300059#WRK01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300059#WRK01550"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[12540\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300059#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding sources that have been investigated to allow grant-aiding of commemorative initiatives, local and national as part of the Decade of Centenaries 2013-23.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The regulation of the industry, including regulatory issues surrounding speeds, is a matter for ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at , as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in County Kerry. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p> -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p> -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services and is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband.<\/p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in Dingle, Co. Kerry before July 2016.<\/p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. <\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.<\/p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300059#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300059#WRK02150"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[12597\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300059#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the costs that have been incurred by the different State agencies regarding the proposals to export wind energy from Ireland to England also land owners who have signed up lease options on their land; if their land will now be in effect sterilised and held up for any further potential for the next 10 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Following concerns that the use of certain categories of biofuels could have Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC) effects that would reduce their effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the EU Commission proposed amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive in 2012 to limit the contribution that these biofuels can make towards renewable energy targets.<\/p><p>  Ireland's preference is to see as low a cap on biofuels with a risk of ILUC effects as is realistically achievable in order to mitigate the potential conflict between biofuel use in the EU and land use in the developing world.

This is an on-going concern for residents, local authorities and my Department.  Until taken in charge, housing developments are the responsibility of the relevant developer and in some cases receivers acting on the instructions of funders acting in possession.<\/p><p><i><\/i>My Department does not hold specific information in relation to the list of developments where there may be difficulties with public lighting, this being a matter for the local authorities concerned and subject to constant change as the planning enforcement, taking in charge and unfinished housing development processes are implemented by local authorities. However, my Department intends to issue a circular letter to local authorities outlining a uniform approach to be taken by authorities with regard to public lighting in unfinished housing developments.<\/p><p>  I am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on UHDs to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations. My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative (PSI) in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available. To date, &euro;3.26m has been drawn down.<\/p><p>  The Public Safety Initiative provides funding only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development. However, in circumstances where the developer is merely inactive the responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development are matters which need to be addressed between the developer and the relevant stakeholders, and my Department has no remit in this regard.<\/p><p>  Also, Budget 2014 contains a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments. The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer\/owner\/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.<\/p><p>  My Department is currently evaluating SRF proposals from local authorities. I hope that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.<\/p><p>  Regular meetings are held between my Department and local authorities under the auspices of the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments.

Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website <\/p><p>  In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. This data collection exercise has been initiated and will inform future actions. Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review. <\/p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity. In such cases, borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. <\/p><p>  The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now in place to deal with personal insolvency. On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.<\/p><p> To date, 34 households have availed of the Mortgage to Rent scheme facilitating low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable. In addition, my Department has issued full funding approval under the scheme for a further 51 housing units. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body and the family becomes a tenant of the approved housing body. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support. <\/p><p>  The scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears, which was piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, was implemented nationally in recent weeks. With the support of the nister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Housing Finance Agency, I will be allocating an additional &euro;20m to the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) fund in 2014 to significantly expand the capacity of that resource to assist local authority borrowers in mortgage distress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300061#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Initiatives","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300061#WRM00950"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[12651\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300061#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide details and favourable consideration to the requests made to him by the Irish Local Development Network on its engagement with the alignment working group; if he proposes to meet the ILDN at an early date to resolve these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre (JRC) has found that Irish dairy production has the joint lowest carbon footprint in the EU. The footprint of Irish beef is also below the EU average.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has also found that the temperate grassland production system, which is the predominant system of production in Ireland, is one of the most efficient in the world.<\/p><p>  My Department is aware of the need to identify cost effective abatement strategies that can reduce carbon emissions while at the same time improving farm profitability.  We are now preparing the agriculture sectoral roadmap under the Heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill published in early 2013.  This  sectoral roadmap for agriculture will take into account the targets in the industry&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 report as well as the  environmental sustainability commitments contained in that report. However, it is important that the roadmap also seeks to balance the objectives of allowing the food industry grow to meet the food security challenges that face the world as well as meeting the needs of future climate change ambition.<\/p><p>  Work in this issue has been ongoing for some time.  In 2012, Teagasc published its Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture which outlined the detailed research which had been undertaken on a number of existing mitigation strategies.  This provided results showing the technical, financial and environmental effectiveness of implementing these mitigation measures.  These measures include areas such as:<\/p><p>-  Accelerated gains in the genetic merit of cows;<\/p><p>-  Extended grazing season;<\/p><p>-  Fertiliser and manure management.<\/p><p>  Many of these mitigation measures are of direct relevance to dairy farmers and have the strong potential to lessen the environmental impact arising from the proposed expansion of the dairy herd.  Teagasc has tailored its broadly based advisory programmes to increase knowledge and uptake of these measures and has also developed a Carbon Navigator tool  to advise farmers, at individual farm level, on the most cost-effective approach to implementing these measures.<\/p><p>  In addition, the recently published Food Harvest 2020 Environmental Analysis Report assessed the potential environmental impact of increased food production as envisaged under Food Harvest 2020. This comprehensive analysis, which is available on our website, has found that the adoption and use of high technology and best production methodologies at farm production level will yield the best environmental outcomes and result in the most effective mitigation measures.  A wide range of mitigation measures are available in relation to biodiversity, flora and fauna and water quality and there is an extensive list of technically feasible measures for mitigating potential damage to the environment.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the recommendations of the FH 2020 environmental analysis report are informing the drafting of the new 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme (RDP). Proposals in the  current draft programme are designed to progress a range of agri-environmental measures, on-farm resource efficient investments and knowledge transfer mechanisms to support the shift towards a low carbon, climate resilient economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300064#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Bodies","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300064#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[12498\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300064#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will instruct the DSPCA in the interest of transparency to publish an up-to-date account of its kill records.","asker":"1015","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding to animal welfare organisations, including the DSPCA, to assist them in their work in animal care.

As I have stated on a number of occasions it is important to note that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill. A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues. One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy. I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution. This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill. I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  <\/p><p>  I am not in a position to give a comprehensive account of the provisions of the proposed legislation until the Heads of Bill have been agreed by Government.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration. The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.  In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound.  <\/p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements in existing procedures for the tracing of birth parents by people who have been adopted.  The Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1st January last, has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Agency&rsquo;s Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the Agency implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. I have been advised by the  Agency that it is reorganising adoption services in 2014 at a national level, and will consider how best to deploy its staff to deal with this important issue so as to facilitate access to records where they exist. <\/p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Agency.

Targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes such as the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In addition, some 31 national youth work organisations, including Youth Work Ireland, are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 for a new capital funding programmes has been provided to my Department for these schemes.<\/p><p>  In 2014, funding of &euro;124,626 has been allocated for three projects under the Special Projects for Youth Schemes (SPY) operated by Youth Work Ireland, Galway. These projects provide valuable services for young people in the area including Recreational Group Work programmes, In-school-Anti-bullying programmes, Summer Camps, Transition from Primary to Secondary programmes and programmes to promote confidence and self-esteem in young people. It also operates a number of rural youth clubs in the area.  Funding of &euro;47,163 has also been allocated in 2014 by my Department for a Youth Information Centre in Ballinalsoe.  I understand from Youth Work Ireland that it is providing an amount of &euro;65,593 to Youth Work Ireland Galway in 2014 to support the delivery of youth work services at regional level.

The information provided in the parental declaration forms submitted to my Department is verified by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the HSE.

This information is gathered during a &lsquo;snap shot&rsquo; week in the month of October.<\/p><p>  Service providers consider their budget and fees policies prior to the &lsquo;snap shot&rsquo; week based on the number of children they have in the service and their own requests for information from parents to estimate what subvention level they can apply for.

Following verification, participating services are provided with a list of qualifying parents and confirmation of the subvention level applied to each parent.  Parents can appeal if they consider that they are entitled to a higher rate of subvention. Applications for appeal must be submitted within one month of receipt of confirmation of subvention level. The verification process in this school year issued to childcare providers in January and the closing date for parents to appeal these decisions and to establish their eligibility for the programme was the 28th February.  <\/p><p>  The appeals process for this year is underway and the outcomes will be communicated to the childcare providers as quickly as possible.

This will include:<\/p><p>- Examining the midwifery workforce planning needs in a defined number of maternity hospitals nationally using Birthrate plus to include 2 large sized units\/hospitals, 2 medium sized maternity units and 2 smaller units. <\/p><p>- As a result recommend appropriate midwifery staffing and skill mix levels and\/or initiatives to meet emerging models of maternity care ensuring that standards of safety and quality care for women and their families are met in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300068#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly Provision","counter":664,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300068#WRT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[12521\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300068#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update in the consultations on Shaen and Abbeyleix hospitals; the state of the decision making process; and when he will report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on this matter.

This study reviewed the use of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in a population-based cancer screening programme and compared the results with screen-film mammography.

Recent negotiations with the APMI have resulted in additional price reductions being agreed. From 1 April 2014, the maximum price the HSE will pay for generic products will be 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This will result in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% currently to approximately 20%.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduced a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. <\/p><p>  In the case of  drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland. However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  However, I would be disappointed if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients. <\/p><p>  The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. <\/p><p>  Finally, my Department has asked the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (the pharmacy regulator) to consider how to provide greater price transparency in retail pharmacies.

This commitment is borne out by my decision to establish a new Patient Safety Agency (PSA).  The PSA will be established initially on an administrative basis within the HSE structures in 2014.  The HSE will establish a Board to oversee the PSA and agree its initial governance and operational arrangements.  A key role for the PSA will be to provide national leadership for patient advocacy services.  The HSE is expected to begin the process of recruiting an interim CEO for the PSA shortly.<\/p><p>  An on-line information service called healthcomplaints.ie was launched in September, 2011.  This initiative, which was developed by the Office of the Ombudsman in cooperation with   a number of organisations including my Department and the HSE, provides information on how to make a complaint or give feedback about health and social care services in Ireland. This website has been developed for people who use health and social care services in Ireland, as well as for their families, care-givers and advocates.  <\/p><p>  I will now outline the avenues open to individuals to make a complaint about the health services.<\/p><p>1. HSE Complaints Process<\/p><p>  Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 states that a person has the right to complain about any action of the Health Service Executive (HSE) or a service provider that they believe was not fair or had an adverse affect on them. The HSE has appointed designated Complaints Officers to ensure the effective management of complaints throughout their relevant areas of responsibility.  The HSE actively encourages and promotes consumer feedback and links with customers on a regular basis to ensure that the complaint handling processes are effective, are being communicated and are achieving outcomes that are satisfactory to the consumers.<\/p><p>  I believe that it is generally best that complaints are dealt with directly when they occur and all efforts made to resolve them locally with the patient or person that complains.  The HSE continues to seek improvements in its complaint handling ability and capacity in order to respond to the needs of patients. If an individual is unhappy with the way in which his\/her complaint was dealt with the National Advocacy Unit of the HSE will appoint an independent officer to review the complaint.<\/p><p>  In addition to the complaints procedure outlined above, the HSE operates its <i>&lsquo;Risk and Incident Escalation Procedure&rsquo; <\/i>  overseen by its National Incident Management Team (NIMT) in cases where a national or integrated response is required.<\/p><p>2. Coroner<\/p><p>  The Coroner is an independent official with legal responsibility to enquire into the circumstances of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths.  This may require a post-mortem examination, sometimes followed by an inquest.  The Coroner essentially establishes the &quot;who, when and how&quot; of unexplained death.  The coronial process comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The recently published Report of the CMO into Perinatal Deaths at HSE Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise (2006-date) recommended that guidelines for staff should be developed which provide information on the inquest process, detail expected behaviours and requirements for attendance. My Department will be engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of the Coronial service.<\/p><p>3. HIQA<\/p><p>  I also have the power under Section 9 (2) of the Health Act 2007 to direct HIQA to undertake an immediate investigation into the safety, quality and standards of a health service provider where I believe that there is a serious risk to the health and welfare of a person receiving those services or where the risk may be the result of any act, failure to act or negligence on the part of the HSE, a service provider, the registered provider of a designated centre or the person in charge of a designated centre if other than its registered provider.  A number of such investigations have taken place, with the most recent being the HIQA investigation into University Hospital Galway (October 2012).<\/p><p>4. Office of the Ombudsman<\/p><p>  An individual may at any time refer a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.  The  Ombudsman can  examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies, including the HSE.  In addition, since January 2007 he\/she may also examine complaints about agencies delivering health and personal social services on behalf of the HSE.  These agencies can include charitable organisations or voluntary bodies.  <\/p><p>  The Ombudsman can examine complaints about how staff of the HSE or other agencies carry out their everyday administrative activities when providing services to members of the public. These include complaints about delays or failing to take action.  The Ombudsman deals with all complaints independently and impartially when judging whether the action or decision of the HSE or a service provider was fair and reasonable.<\/p><p>5. Professional Regulatory Bodies<\/p><p>   Finally, if an individual is unhappy with the level of care provided by a health service employee such as a doctor, nurse or other regulated healthcare professional, he\/she may make a complaint to that employee's professional regulatory body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300071#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300071#WRW01150"},{"type":"question","counter":754,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[12753\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014031300071#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person working and paying tax both in another country (details supplied) and here and living here can qualify for a medical card here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for public health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.

These are decisions for the Boards and management of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland and I have referred the question to them for direct reply.
