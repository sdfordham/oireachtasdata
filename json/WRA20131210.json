I have, against that background, previously undertaken  to give serious consideration to the issue.<\/p><p>  Travellers, of course, have the same civil and political rights as other citizens under the Constitution.  Moreover, the key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group which are protected.  The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those EU directives explicitly protects Travellers.<\/p><p>  The commitment I made to give the issue of recognising Travellers as an ethnic minority further consideration led to a Conference on the subject of Ethnicity and Travellers: An Exploration being convened by the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee with support from my Department in September 2012.

As part of that function, particularly under Part IV of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 dealing with the 'Protection of Clients', the Law Society is obliged to continue to maintain and administer the Solicitors Compensation Fund.  Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Law Society that any client of a solicitor has sustained loss in consequence of fraud or dishonesty on the part of that solicitor or any clerk or servant of that solicitor arising from that solicitor's practice as a solicitor within the jurisdiction of the State, then, subject to the relevant provisions, the Society is required to make a grant to that client out of the Compensation Fund.  It is also provided that before a practising certificate can be issued to a solicitor, the solicitor in question must have paid the annual contribution to the Fund and the issuing of a practising certificate can be withheld until the payment has been made.<\/p><p>  As such, the Compensation Fund and its attendant inspection procedures under which, I am informed, around 400 inspections were carried out by the Law Society last year, provide an important protection against acts of fraud and dishonesty that may be perpetrated by solicitors in the handling of clients' monies.  As Deputies will be aware, the Fund has been relied upon in a number of high profile cases in recent times.  In the five years of 2008 to 2012, I am advised  the Fund paid out a total of &euro;17.7 million in claims.  The total in claims actually made for that same period was nearly &euro;48 million.  There was a 9% increase in the 266 claims made against the Compensation Fund in 2012 over the previous year's 244 claims though this remains much less than the peak of 672 claims received in 2008.  The net assets of the Solicitors Compensation Fund were valued at &euro;18 million as at 30th June 2013.  In the six months up to that date 165 claims on the Fund were received which, excluding invalid claims refused, amounted to &euro;1.16 million. The annual contribution to the Fund for 2013 is &euro;760 per solicitor.  Annual insurance cover for &euro;50 million with an excess of &euro;5 million is also in place.<\/p><p>  Under the Compensation Fund structures provided for under the Solicitors Acts, the Law Society is, therefore, able to respond immediately to serious financial complaints and has the right to carry out investigations, without notification, where justified by the circumstances.  The Society can also apply to the High Court for orders to protect clients' funds when serious irregularities arise.  Pay-outs by the Compensation Fund have a serious impact, including in terms of ongoing costs, across its entire solicitor membership.  To that extent, the Fund has a capacity to strongly incentivise financial compliance by solicitors in the public interest while simultaneously avoiding the imposition of an undesirable burden on the State or public resources.  It should also be borne in mind that, following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, the Law Society is  required to investigate compliance with anti-laundering regulations.<\/p><p>  Against this background, I would consider it prohibitive for the State to assume the enormous and ongoing liabilities that may arise directly or indirectly from the acts of fraudulent solicitors or the operation of the Solicitors' Compensation Fund.  It would not be in the public interest to carry potential liabilities for solicitors' fraud of tens of millions of euro that would, under such an arrangement, have to be paid indefinitely out of the public purse.  However, while it is my considered view that the Law Society should retain responsibility for the Solicitors Compensation Fund, I am happy to report that, under the Legal Services Regulation Bill which is at Committee Stage, any matters of professional misconduct or discipline that may arise from cases of solicitors' fraud or dishonesty are, in the future, to be dealt with independently under the aegis of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000052#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Remit","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000052#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[52653\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000052#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is satisfied that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has sufficient powers to investigate Garda malpractice, in view of statements made by both the ombudsman commission and the Garda Commissioner.

These two reports recommended a number of changes aimed at ensuring that tighter administrative procedures are correctly followed throughout the Force in relation to the cancellation of fixed charge notices.  The report from the Professional Standards Unit did not, however, include a specific recommendation for any separate investigation of the type referred to in the Deputy's question.<\/p><p>  As I have previously advised, the two reports were published on my Department's website on 15 May 2013.  In publishing the reports, I welcomed their recommendations for enhanced safeguards to ensure integrity in the Fixed Charge Processing System.\u00a0 In addition, in order to provide even further public reassurance as to the effectiveness of these changes, and with the agreement of the Garda Commissioner, I asked the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to review the recommendations, to make any necessary supplementary recommendations, and to then review their implementation after 18 months.\u00a0\u00a0The Inspectorate is making progress with this work and I expect to receive their report shortly.

At that time there were approximately 22,000 applications awaiting decision, many of which had been waiting for 3 years or longer.  Notwithstanding the significant increase of almost 60% in the volume of valid applications received - from 12,500 in 2010 to just under 20,000 in 2012 - some 68,000 decisions on valid naturalisation applications have been made since I came into office.  In the past year I have decided over 30,000 applications and issued certificates of naturalisation to some 28,000 applicants.  Quite clearly, this has also resulted in a huge reduction in processing times, with over 70% of standard applications now being decided within 5 months.  This is a major reform given the 115% increase in valid application levels since 2008, when processing times were more than 4 times longer.  At present, there are approximately 8,500 applications pending a decision.  It is my intention that we will continue to build on this success in 2014 and to further reduce the time taken to reach a decision for most applications.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, as well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is also a major step for the State as it confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State, but also at European Union level.  It is therefore vital that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b> All applications are processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and are submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.<\/p><p>  This successful tackling of the backlog of citizenship applications has no direct impact on the direct provision system as persons in direct provision have not yet had their protection applications determined.  If a person is successful in a protection application, he or she may apply for a certificate of naturalisation when they are in a position to meet the statutory residency requirements.  It is my objective to speed up the protection determination process to the greatest possible extent, consistent with natural justice and asylum law, to keep the number of persons housed in this system as low as humanly possible.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, the Deputy may wish to note that the greater majority of successful naturalisation applicants are not asylum seekers and in fact are migrants who came to Ireland for work and other related reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000052#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":38,"content":"<p>Question No. 83 answered with Question No. 75.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Investigations","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000052#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[52547\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000052#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 129 of 13 November 2013, if he will amend legislative provisions in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission so that the Irish model would be similar to the model in place in Northern Ireland whereby a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a member of staff of the commission could not investigate a complaint against a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in circumstances where the investigator had a conflict of interest.

They are not accountable to the Minister for Justice and Equality for their performance of this statutory function.<\/p><p>  The activities of revenue sheriffs in discharging this function are governed by a Code of Practice which is published on the web site of the Revenue Commissioners (www.revenue.ie).  The Code contains provisions governing contact between the revenue sheriff and taxpayers, as well as a procedure for handling taxpayer complaints.  Under the Code, revenue sheriffs are required to investigate written complaints and respond as promptly as is practicable in the circumstances.  A written appeal against such a response may be lodged with the Revenue Commissioners and the Commissioners may request the revenue sheriff to carry out a review of his or her decision.  Where, following this review, the matter has not been resolved, the complaint may be referred to the Joint Standing Committee (JSC) of the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs' Association for further review.<\/p><p>  As I stated in responses to earlier Questions from the Deputy on this matter, revenue sheriffs are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.

Where computer equipment containing personal data has been seized by the revenue sheriff, such data should be returned under secure conditions to the person from whom the equipment was seized unless there is a legitimate reason for non-return of the data.  Such reasons could, of course, vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case.<\/p><p>  I should add that enforcement of the data protection legislation is a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner.

While money laundering is an offence of itself, it would of course be reasonable to consider it closely associated with organised crime which generate significant financial gain.  Addressing organised crime in all of its guises remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and these priorities are clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013.<\/p><p>  In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks by utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies.  In addition, multidisciplinary approaches are used to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p><p>  Specifically with regard to money laundering, the Deputy may wish to note that the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act, 2010 represents a radical overhaul of the anti-money laundering system in establishing a new framework of anti-money laundering regulation for credit and financial institutions and other &quot;designated persons&quot; in line with the 3rd EU Money Laundering Directive and the standards of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  In addition, the Criminal Justice Act 2013 made further amendments to that Act in order to align certain provisions more closely with international standards.  Furthermore, in February 2012, the FATF further revised its standards with the aim of strengthening and protecting the systems in place to deal with money laundering and terrorist financing and proposals for a 4th EU Money Laundering Directive are currently being negotiated which will take into account the revised FATF recommendations.<\/p><p>  In concluding, I can fully assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to vigorously pursue all persons involved in organised criminal activity including money laundering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000052#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000053#WRC00075"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[52651\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000053#WRC00100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps that can be taken by either his office or the Law Society to deal with a practising solicitor who suppresses information in his or her possession in relation to child sexual abuse, leading to a continuation of that abuse.

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to reduce the burden of legal costs on consumers and enterprise.<\/p><p>  The Bill, in three of the objectives it sets out in section 9 for the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, balances the focus of regulation more evenly to the benefit of consumers of legal services.  It does this in terms of 'protecting and promoting the public interest, protecting and promoting the interests of consumers relating to the provision of legal services and, promoting competition in the provision of legal services in the State'.<\/p><p>  Building on these key and consumer focussed objectives, the Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles.  These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication.  These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.<\/p><p>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business.  It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.  Legal practitioners, whether solicitor or barrister, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.<\/p><p>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &ndash; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Guidelines and will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its decisions about disputed legal costs.  The Bill also facilitates the introduction of new business models for the delivery of legal services including alongside other services where costs efficiencies can be captured to the benefit of consumers.  In other provisions the Bill lifts existing restrictions on direct access to a barrister and on barristers who share premises or costs from advertising themselves as such a group.  The Bill also allows that a barrister in employment may provide legal services for his or her employer.<\/p><p>  In support of new and more open regulatory and legal costs regimes, the Bill also provides for a new and independent regulator  in the form of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be bolstered by an independent complaints regime and an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal.  This will provide a first port of call that is entirely independent of the legal professional bodies for members of the public who may have complaints about solicitors or barristers.  The comprehensive range of relevant reform measures contained in the Bill is intended to better empower the consumer of legal services in terms of both the standard of those services and their cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000053#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":83,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bail Provisions","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000053#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[52634\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000053#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when he expects to be in a position to introduce the necessary legislation to discourage recidivism, with particular reference to the introduction of bail restrictions to impede those who commit crime while on bail for a previous offences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Section 2(2)(d) provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under that section, a court shall take into account and may receive evidence or submissions concerning any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.<\/p><p>  The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served.  It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.

The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.<\/p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out a review incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies.

An estimated 350,000 took part in an anti-government rally in Kyiv on 1 December to demonstrate their support for Ukraine&rsquo;s political association and closer integration with the EU.  The protests have focused on Independence Square and in the areas surrounding the Presidential Administration, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and Parliament.  There are also protests on a smaller scale in other parts of the country.<\/p><p>  The rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and are fundamental in any society.  I strongly believe that these rights should be fully respected by the Ukrainian authorities and would expect nothing less from the current holder of the Chairmanship-in-Office of the OSCE.  The demonstrations have been largely peaceful though there have been reports of provocateurs being active among the crowds.  The excessive use of force by the police over the weekend of 30 November-1 December in an effort to disperse peaceful protestors was not justified and has been, rightly, widely condemned.<\/p><p>  I fully support the call made in Kyiv on 4 December by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Thorbjorn Jagland, for an immediate and thorough investigation into the violence.  In that context, I welcome Prime Minister Azarov&rsquo;s apology to the people in Parliament on 3 December for the police actions and the announcement of measures to be taken against those who had used force.  While I have not spoken to the Honorary Consul, I have been kept informed of developments by Ireland&rsquo;s Prague-based Ambassador to Ukraine who was in Kyiv from 2-4 December.  She has reported to me on meetings which she attended during her visit with the Ukrainian authorities, with other resident Ambassadors and with Ireland&rsquo;s Honorary Consul.   <\/p><p>  As for the background to the demonstrations, I am on record as expressing our disappointment with Ukraine&rsquo;s decision to postpone the Association Agreement process while reiterating that the European Union&rsquo;s comprehensive and generous offer remains on the table.  Together with the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement this package was the most ambitious offer made to any partner by the EU.  It was also one very much in the interests of Ukraine and its people in terms of the long term benefits it would bring.<\/p><p>  I am encouraged that contacts are ongoing between the Ukrainian government and the EU and hope that the Association Agreement process can be resumed.  This will require Ukraine to make further tangible progress on the conditions set out by the Foreign Affairs Council last December, including in the area of selective justice.  Important progress by Ukraine had been achieved. I commend the European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission, led by former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa&oelig;nievski, and former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, for their intensive engagement with the Ukrainian authorities over many months on all areas of concern.<\/p><p>  Of course, ultimately it is a matter for Ukraine to decide freely what kind of engagement it wishes to have with the EU.  In the meantime, I urge the Ukrainian government to fully abide by its international commitments to respect the rights to freedom of expression and assembly.  In this very tense and fluid situation, it is incumbent on all sides to show the utmost restraint and I would stress the importance of dialogue to help reduce the tension and to try to find an agreed way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[52718\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has spoken to the Irish Honorary Consul in Bangkok recently regarding the ongoing violence there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These are the loss of the additional supplies formerly obtained through the smuggling tunnels from Egypt, as a consequence of developments in that country, and an ongoing dispute between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas authorities in Gaza, who have refused to pay for the fuel supplies which the PA formerly sent to them, and which were allowed through by Israel.<\/p><p>  I repeat my call in reply to a recent Question on this topic for all relevant authorities in the area to consider the effects of their actions on the ordinary people of Gaza, who are helpless among these conflicting forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[53551\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount of funding his Department gives to Irish charities; the name of each organisation that receives funding; the amount of funding each organisation receives; the number that are open and transparent regarding salaries; and the steps he is taking to deal with non-disclosures.

About a quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance is channelled through Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).  This reflects the strong contribution which Irish NGOs are making to the fight against world poverty and hunger, and the broad support which they continue to receive from the Irish public.  Funding is provided to support the long-term development work carried out by NGOs in developing countries, as well as emergency humanitarian assistance and development education programmes.<\/p><p>  Given the level of Government funding for the NGO sector, the issue of their internal governance arrangements is a matter of legitimate public interest.  It is important to note, however, that NGOs are independent organisations. The salary levels of their employees are determined by the Board of the NGO and are typically funded from a variety of income sources, including general donations from the public, bequests and official funding.  In relation to the funding provided through the Irish Aid programme, my Department appraises funding applications from the NGOs and assesses the cost efficiency and effectiveness of their projects and programmes and the basis of their expenditure decisions.  Financing agreements between Irish Aid and NGO partners include clear parameters on certain cost categories, including administration costs.  A limit of 6% of funding provided can be allocated to administration costs, with remuneration levels for senior executives being reviewed in the context of overall administration costs. <\/p><p>  In 2012, Irish Aid entered into agreements for a new series of programme grants with the larger Irish development NGOs for their long term development work over a four year period.  These agreements require these NGOs to follow best practice financial reporting standards for staff salaries as set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice in place in the UK. This British standard is currently used by Irish Aid, pending the establishment of the Charity Regulatory Authority.  In line with the standard, these NGOs are required to set out in their published audited financial statements the number of staff receiving salaries above &euro;70,000.<\/p><p>  The statistical annexes to the Irish Aid Annual Report provide a detailed analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA, across a range of metrics including details of funding to non-governmental and civil society organisations. The most recent data published relates to ODA for 2012 and is available on the Irish Aid website at .  Detailed statistical analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA for 2013 will be compiled early in the New Year and will subsequently be published on the Irish Aid web site.<\/p><p>  My Department provides funding for the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the <b>Fulbright Commission<\/b>), which is a registered charity, on an annual basis.  A grant of &euro;254,000 was provided to the Commission in 2013.  The Commission was established by the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991 to facilitate the administration of educational and cultural exchanges between Ireland and the United States of America.  Under the Act, the approval of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ambassador of the United States is required for the engagement of an Executive Director and other administrative and clerical staff.  Terms and conditions (including salary levels) for the staff are set by the Commission itself. Details of the staff salary levels are made available to my Department.  Members of the Commission do not receive remuneration.  My Department is provided with annual financial statements of the Commission, as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These financial statements are also laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s <b>Emigrant Support Programme<\/b> (ESP), provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  Applicant organizations to the ESP should be established as registered charities, charitable bodies or voluntary\/not for profit organizations.  While the vast majority of funding under the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) is provided to organisations overseas, almost 12% of the budget is allocated to Irish based organisations.  Recipient organisations here are typically active in providing services to returning or departing Irish emigrants or in promoting Irish heritage and sport abroad.  Organisations receiving grants under the Emigrants Support Programme (ESP) are required to submit a financial report for each programme funded and financial accounts or audited financial statement.  Full details of all funding provided by the Emigrant Support Programme can be found here: .<\/p><p>  Through the <b>Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds<\/b>, which support cross-community outreach in Northern Ireland and the border counties, cross-border co-operation and sensitive commemorative and cultural events, my Department has awarded a total of &euro;1,751,183 so far in 2013. A table of all organisations awarded funding is set out below.  Funding is awarded only for project costs.  Salary costs are ineligible for support from the Funds.  There are mechanisms for annual reporting and accounting by recipient organisations.

C<\/font>rypto-currencies are not legal tender in the Euro area.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that e-commerce, including the use of virtual currencies, present a challenge to tax administrations throughout the world.  Specifically, regarding the possible use of crypto-currencies (including Bitcoin) to circumvent taxes, the Revenue Commissioners and tax administrations in other countries are actively monitoring developments.  Because Bitcoin is a combination of some factors that constitute a commodity and some that constitute a currency, the implications for taxation are varied.<\/p><p>  If Bitcoins are received as payments in commerce, then the same rules in place for payments received in other foreign currencies also apply.  If speculation on Bitcoin occurs, the taxation rules that would apply to any gain are applicable.  More specifically, VAT is generally chargeable on the total consideration for goods and services, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges (excluding the VAT chargeable in respect of that supply).  This general rule is based on the EU VAT Directive.  Where the consideration does not consist of, or does not consist wholly of, and amount of money, VAT is chargeable by reference to what might reasonably be expected to be the open-market price of the good and services supplied.  The VAT Regulations require that the amount of tax included on an invoice is expressed in Euro.  The exchange rate to be used for non Euro currency transactions is either the latest selling rate for the foreign currency recorded by the European Central Bank or alternative method of determining the exchange rate that is agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  More broadly, I am advised that shadow economy activity has always been attracted to cash businesses, in large part because of the difficulties in traceability and record keeping.

While it has the potential to increase instances of non-compliance, I am advised that, currently, the threat posed to the Exchequer is likely to be small.  It is probable too that for some evaders, it represents a new opportunity for existing non-compliance, rather than a new form of evasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Exemptions","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD02850"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[52562\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will give consideration to providing an exemption to the universal social charge in cases where medical expenses are greater than taxable income, particularly for residents of nursing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  The USC is a charge on the gross income of individuals if their gross income exceeds the USC threshold of &euro;10,036 per annum.  It applies on a broad base with very few exceptions. <\/p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of health expenses in the provision of health care incurred by an individual or an individual&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, on their own behalf or on behalf of someone else.  Relief is provided at the standard rate except in the case of nursing home fees which are provided at the marginal rate. <\/p><p>  There is no relief against Universal Social Charge for health expenses.  However, it should be noted that payments from the Department of Social Protection such as the State Pension are exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC).  In addition, individuals aged 70 and over, provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000, are not liable to the top rate of charge and payments from the Department of Social Protection will not be taken in to account in determining if an individual has exceeded the &euro;60,000 threshold.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009 was introduced to provide financial support for people assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  The scheme is founded on the core principles that long-term care should be affordable and that a person should receive the same level of State support whether they choose a public, voluntary or private nursing home.  Since the 27th October 2009, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is the single funded means of accessing long-term nursing home care for all new entrants. <\/p><p>  Any contribution made by an individual in defraying expenses in the nature of maintenance or treatment in a nursing home, where that individual has received State support under section 3 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, is treated as health expenses qualifying for relief.  This relief is given at the marginal rate of tax but cannot exceed an amount which reduces the income tax liability for the year to nil.  As stated previously, this compares with tax relief at the standard rate for any other health expenses.  Given the additional tax relief currently available for nursing home fees I would not be in favour of providing an additional relief from USC for such fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Guarantee Scheme Administration","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[52671\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000054#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of the auditors who audited Irish banks prior to the introduction of the bank guarantee; if these audit companies continue to have an audit role within the same banks covered by the guarantee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>May I bring to the Deputy&rsquo;s attention that the details of the auditors of individual banks are publicly available and published in the Annual Reports of the various institutions.

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.<\/p><p>  The proposed new credit, should the changes be approved by the Oireachtas, will operate differently from the One-Parent Family Credit, such that the credit will be available in the first instance, to the primary carer, that is, the single individual with whom the child resides for the greater part of the year. In addition I introduced an amendment at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to allow the primary carer to relinquish the credit such that a non-primary carer can claim it in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  If the primary claimant relinquishes the credit, a secondary claimant may claim it.  The child must reside with this individual for over 100 days in aggregate in the year, which is indicative of a level of involvement in the care of the child that is supportive of the primary claimant.  For the purpose of this limit a day can include the greater part of a day.   <\/p><p>  The new credit will be an activation measure and it is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment. It will assist single parents or carers with the cost of childcare. Where a primary carer chooses to relinquish the credit, it will assist a non-primary carer to take up or remain in employment   The purpose of relinquishment is to ensure that if the primary claimant has insufficient income or does not wish to avail of the credit, a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for over 100 days in the year may claim it in recognition of their involvement with the child and the support they provide to the primary claimant.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this procedure of relinquishment means that two individuals could, by agreement among themselves, alternate claiming the credit with the primary claimant getting it in year one, and the secondary claimant in year two, and so on.<\/p><p>  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  <\/p><p>  Allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents to agree. Therefore, I have no plans to amend the legislation to allow for the splitting or apportioning of the new tax credit.   <\/p><p>  This new policy has been agreed by Government based on a recommendation put forward by the Commission on Taxation that the credit should be retained but that it should be confined to the principal carer only.

Therefore, a decision to hold onto the Preference Shares could not be made unilaterally.

I was not prescriptive in how this was to be achieved respecting their differing State ownership and investment and paths to profitability.  I have reviewed the letters submitted and I am satisfied that the banks will deliver remuneration cost savings of 6% to 10%. <\/p><p>  The Bank of Ireland letter focused on changes to the defined benefit pension scheme that will affect all staff who are members of this scheme and as the deputy will be aware an agreement has now been reached with the IBOA in this regard.  The AIB proposal included the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual along with other changes including an increase in working hours which were agreed with the IBOA in July.  The ptsb proposal centred on the wind-up of the defined benefit pension scheme for all staff who were members of this scheme. <\/p><p>  For clarity senior management in the banks have made the following contributions; in the case of Bank of Ireland the proposed pension changes affect all staff in the BSPF scheme including the Chief Executive.  AIB has taken the following specific actions to address remuneration levels: reductions in pay and benefits of higher earners ranging from 7.5% to 15% implemented in the second half of 2012 and it also should be noted that the AIB Leadership Team have all joined the bank since 2008 and receive reduced pension contributions from their predecessors.  In the case of ptsb all senior management have been negatively impacted  .<\/p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency published a table of salaries by salary band at the end of 2012 on page 35 of its annual report; the table shown below splits the staff into individuals who work for NAMA and the NTMA.

For example in one institution there are 12 different pension schemes with 12 different sets of terms and conditions.  Further given the fluidity of the current employment situation in the institutions e.g. the current schemes for early retirements and voluntary redundancies, freedom of personnel to leave on notice and the individual nature of retirement packages especially at executive level (transfer in arrangements), it is not possible to forecast figures in relation to future entitlements.<\/p><p>  While the trustees of the schemes have actuarial models which allow them to forecast the financial state of the various schemes, these models are not available to my department and the institutions rely on their pension trustees for forecasting.  In addition to the points above, due to the small number of individuals in some institutions, even if it were possible to calculate the data, it would not be possible to release the information due to data protection constraints on personal data.<\/p><p>  NTMA employees are members of the NTMA defined benefit superannuation scheme or else have Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.  The pension benefits of members of the NTMA superannuation scheme prior to 1 January 2010 are based on final salary.  The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings.  Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay as you go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme.  Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme.  Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme.  The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1\/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000056#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":245,"content":"<p>Question No. 153 answered with Question No. 149.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Staff Issues","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000056#WRF02050"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[52987\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000056#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff who have left Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited or the National Treasury Management Agency since 1 January 2011 to join AIB, Bank of Ireland or Permanent TSB; if he will provide details of the posts which these persons vacated at Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the posts they took up in AIB, Bank of Ireland or Permanent TSB; and the month in which they took up these positions.

Lenders must assess whether an alternative repayment arrangement can be put in place and allow the SME appeal that decision and meetings with SMEs which approach them with concerns about meeting repayments.<\/p><p>  The banks are required to comply with the Code as a matter of law.  The Code makes it clear that anybody acting for or on behalf of a bank is subject to its provisions.  The Central Bank can invoke its statutory powers to require compliance with the Code.

Updates and changes to these pages are made exclusively by Indirect Taxes Division. <\/p><p>  The Taxes and Duties section of the Revenue website contains a range of information regarding VAT.  The VAT rates database, which contains details of an extensive listing of products and services, links to the applicable rate of VAT and other related information.  The VAT treatment indicated is based on current practice and is not to be regarded as a statement of law or as a substitute for consulting the legislation. <\/p><p>  The entire database is updated on a regular basis with rates on new goods or services or amendments to previously published rates based on changes in legislation, appeal decisions or the nature of the goods and services.  When the database is updated, the rate shown for each good and service, whether it has been changed or not, is given the same update date.  At present rates show an update date of 23 July 2013.<\/p><p>  The 'cowmats' entry has been on the website database since the 1990s.  The original entry read &quot;Cowmats - Supply and Install Rate 21%&quot;, which was the standard rate of VAT at the time.  In conjunction with the introduction of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 the database was upgraded to include an enhanced remarks field.  Since 2010, the entry on the database makes reference to the two-thirds rule that may apply to cowmats in very exceptional circumstances.  The entry on the database since the introduction of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 reads   <i>&ldquo;Cowmats &ndash; Supply and Fit Rate Standard Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 Ref: Section 46(1)(a) Remarks;  However, some cowmats may be regarded as fixtures e.g. mats set in wet concrete or stuck down over their entire surface qualify as fixtures, subject to the 2\/3 rule.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>  Section 41 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 specifies that where the value of movable goods provided under an agreement for the supply of services exceeds two-thirds of the total consideration under the agreement for the provision of those goods and the supply of the services the consideration shall be deemed to be referable solely to the supply of the goods and tax shall be charged at the VAT rate appropriate for the goods.  This is known as the two-thirds rule.  The two-thirds rule applies to construction services for agricultural buildings and non-residential immovable goods.  The two-thirds rule has been a feature of VAT since its introduction and is applied in all relevant cases.<\/p><p>  Revenue select cases for intervention using a risk-based approach that considers the presence of various risk indicators and other information available, with the aid of their computerised risk analysis system, REAP.  The type of intervention to be undertaken is, in any particular case, the one considered to be the most appropriate to target the specific risk identified. In many cases this may lead to a single tax head, multi tax head or single-issue audit rather than a comprehensive audit.<\/p><p>  Section 46 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides that tax shall be charged in relation to the supply of goods or services at the rates set out in that section.  Where an intervention results in the conclusion that a supplier has charged the incorrect rate of VAT, Revenue may recover the underpaid VAT by raising assessments under section 111 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.  The recipient of a VAT invoice has an entitlement to an input credit only for the VAT shown on the invoice where the goods or services are used by him or her for the purpose of VAT-able supplies.  The issuer of an invoice which shows VAT at a lower rate than the correct rate for the transaction may seek to justify their failure to correctly operate the VAT system by claiming that a loss of revenue does not arise where the recipient of the invoice, such as a VAT registered farmer, had full recoverability for the VAT.<\/p><p>  Revenue has a clear responsibility to ensure the correct operation of the tax system, and the onus of proof that 'no loss of revenue' arises rests clearly with the taxpayer and the taxpayer and\/or the tax adviser in any case must engage directly with their Revenue district to establish this.  The procedures in relation to 'no loss of revenue' are clearly set out in Revenue's Code of Practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000056#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Staff Issues","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000057#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[53063\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000057#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if AIB has any plans to outsource certain jobs from Ireland over the next number of years as part of Project Orion; if he will provide details of this project including the cost, the number of jobs involved and the functions that may be transferred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware under the Relationship Framework the State does not intervene in the day to day operations of the bank or their management decisions regarding commercial decisions.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. <\/p><p>All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/14 school year by 15th March, 2013.  The NCSE published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/2014 school year in June of this year.  The NCSE has also now published details of the additional SNA allocations which have been made to schools since the initial allocations were made to schools in June.  The NCSE published details of these revised allocations on 21st October, 2013.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis<\/p><p>The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>  The level of support required by pupils with special educational needs may change from year to year, in line with their changing care needs including diminishing care needs as they mature and become more independent over time, for example.  The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the revised SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them.  In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school. <\/p><p> I understand from officials at my Department that a response will issue to the Deputy from the National Council for Special Education by the end of this week regarding the individual case referred to him in this question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000059#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Statistics","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000059#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[52845\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000059#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of fee-paying schools here; and the number of fee-paying schools that offer the leaving certificate applied programme.

","asker":"1058","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p>I am satisfied that robust external inspection arrangements are in place that predominantly focus on evaluating the quality of learning and teaching in schools.  During all whole school evaluations, inspectors provide individual teacher feedback and whole-school feedback highlighting good practice and aspects of practice that require improvement.  The reports arising from whole school inspections and subject inspections are published so that there is a clear record of the strengths of the school and the areas that require improvement.<\/p><p>  To complement these evaluation models the Inspectorate conducts unannounced incidental inspections focussed also on evaluating the quality of teaching and learning in classrooms.  Since the introduction of unannounced incidental inspections in November 2011 some 700 unannounced inspections have been conducted in post-primary schools.  The inspectorate has also commenced specific follow-through evaluations where inspectors monitor the implementation by schools of recommendations from previous inspections and it is expected that these reports will also be published from 2014.  The Inspectorate has been and continues to be engaged in an ongoing programme to review existing inspection models such as whole-school evaluation, and to develop and introduce new models of inspection and reporting on schools in line with section 13(8) of the Education Act, 1998.  <\/p><p>  Responsibility for addressing shortcomings in learning and teaching in a school rests primarily with the school's board of management and its leadership team in the case of voluntary secondary and community and comprehensive schools and with the school leadership team and the relevant Education and Training Board in the case of schools run under the auspices of Education and Training Boards.  This responsibility placed on schools to address any inadequacies in teaching is underpinned by the provisions of Section 24 of the Education Act and related circulars.  Procedures for dealing with professional competence and disciplinary matters for teachers are in place for all schools.  Under the penultimate stage of these formal procedures, boards of management are required to seek an independent evaluation of the work of a teachers where the board of school is dissatisfied with the professional standards of the teacher's work.  The Inspectorate has responded to all such requests from boards of management and has conducted the requisite inspection visits and provided reports to the boards of management involved.<\/p><p>  In the small number of schools where the Inspectorate has identified serious weaknesses in the quality of teaching and learning or in the leadership and management of schools, the Department has engaged with the patron, trustees or management of the school to ensure that the need for improvement and change is fully appreciated by the school and by those responsible for its management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000059#WRJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[53009\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000059#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide in tabular form by county, the number of inspections carried out by the Chief Inspector in 2012; the number of inspections that were carried out as a result of a request from the building and planning units; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is part of the standard set out by the Teaching Council in the Code of Professional Conduct for Teachers, and it is something that society and students can reasonably expect from their teachers.<blockquote>  My Department supports teachers in this endeavour by providing a wide range of CPD opportunities.  In relation to Irish in particular there has been significant investment in CPD in recent years, such as:<br \/><br \/>- CPD in relation to the national literacy and numeracy strategy for primary teachers and post-primary teachers, including specific provision for teachers in Irish medium schools and a commitment to offering 20 hours of CPD over the course of 5 years to certain teachers.<br \/><br \/>- CPD for post primary teachers of Irish from 2007-2012 provided by the Seirbh&iacute;s Taca&iacute;ochta Dara Leibh&eacute;al don Ghaeilge.

It was recommended by the Labour Court that anyone who is on sick leave at the time of the introduction of the new scheme will continue to avail of the current sick leave scheme and will be provided with access to six months full pay and six months half pay (over a four year rolling period) for the duration of that particular illness.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of retrospection it was agreed by the Labour Court that an employee&rsquo;s sick leave records over the last four years will, as is currently the case, be used to determine whether an individual has access to sick pay or not.  In the case of a non-critical illness there will, however, be a reduction in the number of days sick leave absences in the preceding four year period above which there will be no entitlement to paid sick leave &ndash; other than Temporary Rehabilitation Pay - from 365 days to 183 days.  The new sick leave arrangements were agreed under the Croke Park Agreement and did not form part of the Haddington Road Agreement.  The parameters of the new sick leave scheme are contained in the Labour Court Recommendation and the scheme will be implemented in accordance with this recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000060#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oireachtas Members' Remuneration","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000060#WRK02050"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[52780\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000060#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide in tabular form for each of the years 2007 to 2013, inclusive, the gross annual salary of a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; the gross annual salary of a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann; the total amount paid to all Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in expenses and allowances; the total amount paid to Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in expenses and allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation draw-down pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  The profiling of capital expenditure is carried out by individual Departments on the basis of the likely timing of payments related to capital projects and programmes which they deliver.<\/p><p>  While gross capital expenditure was 13.9% behind profile at the end of November, information supplied by Departments indicates that the majority of their remaining capital budgets will be spent by year end.  The spending pattern is in line with trends from previous years which show that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place towards the end of the year.  Where it is not possible to spend their capital allocation in full by year end, Departments may apply to carryover unspent capital (up to a maximum of 10% of their Voted capital allocation) into the next year.  Any underspends in the capital budget which are not carried over into 2014 will be returned, as a saving, to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  In the context of the requirement to meet our deficit targets and restore our economic sovereignty, each Department must ensure that the Vote level allocations are adhered to and that both capital and current expenditure are managed from within the overall allocation for the Vote.

While this estimate for labour intensity is used as a general rule of thumb, it is important to note that the amount of employment generated by capital expenditure depends on how that expenditure is invested.  For example, the purchase of new rail rolling stock would typically generate little direct employment in Ireland as such stock is generally produced abroad.  Furthermore, different types of public construction project have different levels of labour intensity.  For example, smaller scale projects such as school building and repair, or smaller local and regional road-works, tend to be more labour intensive than major national infrastructural projects.<\/p><p>  The Exchequer capital framework for the period 2012 to 2016 was set following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme conducted in 2011.  The focus of that review was the identification of infrastructural investment that can aid economic growth, generate sustainable jobs in the medium term, and address urgent social requirements.  Much of the capital programme for the five year period of the Framework is geared towards smaller, more labour intensive projects.  It is also noteworthy that investment in enterprise supports has the highest direct employment impact.  Accordingly, the capital Framework made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.<\/p><p>  Since the capital plan was launched in 2011, the Government has been able to announce a number of increases to its infrastructure investment through the introduction of a new PPP pipeline and the use of the proceeds from the State asset and Lottery licence transactions.  This additional investment is expected to support significant numbers of jobs across the country.  The previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment in the PPP Pipeline may support in the region of 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.  In addition to this, it is envisaged that the additional Exchequer funding of &euro;150 million, which I announced in June of this year, can support up to 3,000 jobs.  These initiatives will of course also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  The Exchequer projects, in particular, involve mostly smaller scale capital works which are known to be labour intensive.<\/p><p>  It is my intention that a review of the public capital investment framework will be undertaken in 2014 in parallel with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Following this, a new five year capital envelope will be set.

Under the initiative, vouchers worth &euro;5,000 are allocated to small businesses whose proposals, to work with public knowledge providers on specific innovation questions, meet simple criteria.<\/p><p>  The following table illustrates the number of Innovation Vouchers issued; the number redeemed and their respective total values since the programme commenced.<\/p><p>Innovation Vouchers Approved and Redeemed for years 2007 to 2012<table><tr><th> -<\/th><th>2007<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>Totals<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Vouchers Redeemed <\/td><td>4<\/td><td>206<\/td><td>526<\/td><td>524<\/td><td>518<\/td><td>525<\/td><td>2303<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Vouchers paid &euro;<\/td><td>18,264<\/td><td>1,014,935<\/td><td>2,406,334<\/td><td>2,591,145<\/td><td>2,573,568<\/td><td>2,547,178<\/td><td>11,151,424<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Vouchers Issued<\/td><td>428<\/td><td>588<\/td><td>798<\/td><td>855<\/td><td>757<\/td><td>767<\/td><td>4193<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> &euro; Amt approved<\/td><td>2,140,000<\/td><td>2,940,000<\/td><td>3,990,000<\/td><td>4,275,000<\/td><td>3,785,000<\/td><td>3,835,000<\/td><td>20,965,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>At the end of 2012, 55% of Vouchers issued were redeemed while 45% of approved Vouchers were not redeemed within the one year period of validity which is broadly typical for this form of innovation support.  For example, in the Netherlands where this scheme was originally established, 40% of issued Vouchers were never redeemed.  The Vouchers target small companies who may decide not to pursue the Voucher for a number of reasons including a change of company direction in the interim or a change of R&amp;amp;D or innovation ambitions.  The projected outturn for 2013 is positive with 1,007 Vouchers issued so far with a value of &euro;5,035,000.  In addition, 491 Vouchers have been redeemed to date with a value of &euro;2,360,337.  Under the current guidelines for the programme companies may make use of a maximum of three vouchers, one of which must be a 50-50 co-funded voucher between Enterprise Ireland and the company.  Excluding cancellations 3,337 companies have received vouchers to date, 76% received one voucher, 21% two vouchers and 3% have received 3 vouchers.<\/p><p>  The timescale between the award of an Innovation Voucher to a payment being drawn down differs as each project is distinct and the time to completion varies widely depending on the circumstances of the company, the knowledge provider and the nature of the project.  Many voucher projects are completed within a month of project commencement whereas others may take up to one year to complete depending on the nature of the work.  Vouchers are valid for one year from the date of issue and in general are redeemed within that period unless an extension is granted.  A formal procedure exists to enable companies to apply for an extension of the voucher, however, information on this specific data set is not available.  Enterprise Ireland believes that the number of Vouchers that have received an extension would represent a very small proportion of the total Vouchers redeemed.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland carry out regular independent programme evaluations to assess the effectiveness of all programmes.  The most recent external evaluation of the Innovation Voucher programme in 2012 indicated high levels of programme effectiveness and company satisfaction.  As part of this evaluation 94% of companies said that they would be willing to participate in an Innovation Voucher project in the future and 93% would be willing to recommend the programme to other businesses.  A further 82% stated that participation in the project has increased their desire to work with research partners in the future.  One of the key objectives of this programme is to improve links between industry and academia &ndash; these findings suggest that the Voucher programme has been successful in doing this.  The findings also demonstrate a very positive company experience and indicate how beneficial companies found the Innovation Voucher programme.<\/p><p>  The evaluation noted that the programme has delivered direct benefits for 69% of companies including new and improved products and processes to the company and to the commercial market.  The evaluation also found that the scheme achieved &euro;7.65 in company turnover per &euro;1.00 invested by Enterprise Ireland to date.  This evaluation also found that most companies were either satisfied or very satisfied with their partner institutes when asked about the following aspects:<blockquote>- overall role of the provider (72%)<br \/><br \/>- partner institute&rsquo;s role in the setting up of the project (67%)<br \/><br \/>- partner institute&rsquo;s role in supporting the project (68%)<br \/><br \/>- partner institute&rsquo;s role in following up the partnership after completion (57%)<\/blockquote>  As a more immediate measure of the achievement of the Voucher&rsquo;s objectives, at the completion of an Innovation Voucher project the company must sign a declaration to confirm that the knowledge provider has completed the project to their satisfaction.  On receipt of the signed declaration Enterprise Ireland can issue a payment in respect of the Voucher.<\/p><p>  Innovation Voucher projects are independent projects carried out by the knowledge providers at the company&rsquo;s behest.  The company requires the skills and expertise which is available within the third level research community to help them address a particular technical issue or challenge that the company faces.  These projects are defined by companies and are in the research domain of the knowledge provider involved.  They are distinct and additional projects to the knowledge provider&rsquo;s core work and are paid for via the Innovation Vouchers.<\/p><p>  A full list of approved knowledge providers who have agreed to participate in the programme is available on the Innovation Voucher website .  This provides a directory of the skills and expertise available within each third level institute and a designated contact person for each knowledge provider.  Enterprise Ireland advise companies who have been awarded Vouchers to use this directory to assist them to contact and select the most appropriate knowledge provider for their project.  The competence of the knowledge provider in relation to providing knowledge to the companies participating in the Innovation Voucher programme is validated by the companies&rsquo; level of satisfaction and through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s evaluation of the programme.<\/p><p>  The Innovation Voucher programme is restricted to small companies* (less than 50 employees) and medium size companies are not currently eligible to apply for a Voucher.  Specific data breaking down further the &quot;small company&quot; designation into further strata such as spin off companies or micro enterprises is not available.<\/p><p>*For the purposes of the Innovation Voucher Initiative, a Small Enterprise is defined as a company or (if part of a group) a group of companies where the total number of full-time employees in the company (or the entire group) is less than 50 and has either an annual turnover and\/or an annual Balance Sheet total not exceeding &euro;10m.

For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by ERO, while for some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry &ndash; a flexibility which cannot be achieved by primary legislation.  Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge.<\/p><p>  The net effect of changing the scope in the ways recommended is intended to reduce the overall size of the JLC to more closely match the majority share of the competitive grocery market; to extend the scope to cover all of the relevant employees that fall within the remit of the JLC and to make it more flexible and simpler to follow and to enforce.  While some shops that are currently covered by the JLC would be excluded, these were not considered by the review to be a significant proportion of the main competitive market of the sector as a whole. <\/p><p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Council has been requested to prepare new orders to give effect to the Labour Court recommendations.  In addition, I am considering legal advice received from the Attorney General and I hope to deal with this issue and other establishment orders shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000062#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000062#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[52953\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000062#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"of the &euro;23 million in capital funding recorded as not spent under the expenditure profile at end November in the most recent analysis of gross Voted expenditure Exchequer figures, the reason for the underspend; if he will provide a breakdown of the capital projects or outlays that have not commenced as yet, as per the profile; if any of the &euro;107.2 million in total capital carryover in Government for 2012 relates to his Department; the amount of same; if it has been spent; on what it has been spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1033","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>The &euro;23million in capital expenditure referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question represents the difference between the capital expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s Vote as reported in the End November Expenditure Return published by the Minister for Finance and the amount of capital expenditure originally profiled for that period at the beginning of the year.  In this regard, as part of assisting the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s oversight of exchequer expenditure, Government Departments, including my own Department, are required to prepare a monthly profile of expected expenditure, including capital expenditure, from their Votes at the beginning of each year.  It is the case that as the financial year progresses there can be a number of reasons why monthly expenditure may deviate from the initial monthly profile, resulting in capital underspends or overspends at the end of a particular month. <\/p><p>  Capital expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s Vote is essentially expended by the enterprise development agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation as well as the County Enterprise Boards.  Typically this funding is by way of grant provision to private industry and to the higher education institutions.  The drawdown of exchequer financial support by companies or other bodies, such as the higher education institutions, is demand-led and funding is provided on the basis of matured liabilities.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that such funding provision can only take place if the entity in question has progressed a given project in line with the agreement entered into with the State.  In addition, there can also be factors such as timing issues relating to the finalisation of legal agreements or the securing of matching private funding by the successful grant applicant to ensure eligibility to drawdown the grant.  Given these factors, it is important to point out that the &euro;23 million referred to by the Deputy represents just 4.7% of the overall Departmental capital budget for 2013.<\/p><p>  Insofar as 2012 situation is concerned, the total Government capital carryover of &euro;107.2 million referred to by the Deputy included an amount of &euro;25 million in capital carryover in respect of my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  I would point out that as part of the conditions associated with any annual capital carryover provision, a Ministerial order approved and signed by the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, requires that carryover money must be expended in the early part of the following financial year to support on-going activity.  Such carryover provision must be exhausted prior to expending any of the capital funding provision approved in the Vote allocation as published on Budget Day. <\/p><p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a breakdown of capital projects in this area, it is the case that as there can be several thousand live grant awards and initiatives being supported across the enterprise agencies at any particular point in time, it would be not feasible to provide the Deputy with specific details regarding the status of projects per profiled expenditure.  The capital expenditure programme overseen by my Department is undoubtedly a key element in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s jobs, enterprise and research activities.  The total capital allocation of &euro;479.5m for 2013, which includes the aforementioned &euro;25m in carryover from 2012, represents a very significant and vital stimulus in the on-going and increasingly successful challenge of promoting enterprise and creating jobs for our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000062#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000062#WRM00550"},{"type":"question","counter":490,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[53033\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000062#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs created and the number of jobs lost for each year since 2007 in the manufacturing and in the financial services sector; the way these figures are determined; and if the recent figures\u00a0are in line with the targets set by the Government for these sectors.","asker":"984","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":491,"content":"<p>The total number of jobs lost and gained for the Manufacturing and Financial Services Sectors, for the period 2007-2012, is set out in the tables below.

JobBridge is a voluntary scheme.  Host organisations are not obliged to offer an intern employment at the end of their internship.  However, a six-month cooling-off period applies where the host organisation cannot advertise for another intern for the same area of activity.  This is to prevent potential displacement.<\/p><p>  As at end of November, 2013, there were over 6,500 jobseekers participating on the scheme.

In all Member States, biofuels will be the largest contributor to meeting this obligation and all biofuels used in doing so must comply with a strict set of sustainability criteria.  The Government shares the concerns expressed that biofuel production and its use, unless properly regulated, may not deliver the required greenhouse gas savings and could impact negatively on food production and on food prices.  My Department has been in regular contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the issue of sustainability and land-use implications of biofuels, including food security and food production.<\/p><p>  In light of these concerns, during discussions on the European Commission's proposal to address the risk of indirect land-use change (ILUC), Ireland has argued for a restriction on first generation biofuels that can contribute to the 2020 renewable energy targets and for incentives to encourage the development of advanced biofuels that do not affect food production.  Our preference is to see as low a cap on biofuels with a risk of ILUC effects as is realistically achievable in order to mitigate the potential conflict between biofuel use in the EU and land use in the developing world.  Ireland will re-emphasise the importance of these concerns at the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting taking place on 12 December.<\/p><p>  As regards biofuel use in Ireland, based on figures provided by the National Oil Reserve Agency (NORA) to my Department, over 16 per cent of the biofuel used in 2012 was produced indigenously with the remainder imported from a number of different countries.  Currently, there is only one biofuel producer of scale in Ireland and it produces biodiesel from waste materials, such as used cooking oil and tallow.  It produced over 99.75 per cent of the indigenously produced biofuels placed on the Irish market last year.  One other Irish producer produced a small amount of biodiesel from rapeseed. <\/p><p>  Table 2 of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme Annual Report for 2012 produced by NORA provides a breakdown of the biofuel placed on the Irish market since the sustainability criteria were fully applied in 2012.

No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the domestic market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.  In addition, no company has opted to offer, on a commercial basis, a feed-in-tariff for microgeneration to the commercial and industrial sectors.<\/p><p>  Currently, a number of supports are available for commercial micro and small scale generation.  All renewable electricity generating technologies can avail of tax relief on capital directly invested in renewable energy assets under Section 486B of the Tax Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 (as amended).  This allows an investor to claim the lesser of 50% of all capital expenditure (excluding lands) or &euro;9.525 million for a single project.  Investment by a company or group under this scheme is capped at &euro;12.7 million per annum.  Corporate investors in renewable energy projects can claim tax relief on equity investment in capital assets.  Other tax based support measures include the <i>Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme<\/i> which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year.  This scheme supersedes the previous Business Expansion Scheme.  It provides a minimum tax relief of 30% with an additional 11% accruing at the end of the third and final year if the business has expanded to employ a designated number of people (or if the investment was used for R&amp;amp;D).  The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and is thus suited to commercial small scale generation projects.  An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies against their tax liabilities in Year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period of years, thus aiding their cash flow.<\/p><p>  Analysis of the potential of microgeneration, using technologies such as solar and small scale wind and hydro, has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  During 2011 and 2012 SEAI carried out microgeneration field trials, a final report on which was submitted to my Department earlier this year.  A progress report on Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), as required by the EU Renewable Energy Directive, is currently being completed.  The findings of this progress report will provide a suitable context for reviewing the potential for cost effective support of microgeneration, and whether any such support should be tariff, or non-tariff, based.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000066#WRQ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000066#WRQ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":691,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[52950\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000066#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"in respect of the &euro;22 million in capital funding recorded as not spent under the expenditure profile at end November in the most recent analysis of gross Voted expenditure Exchequer figures, the reason for the underspend; if he will provide a breakdown of the capital projects or outlays that have not commenced as yet, as per the profile; if any of the &euro;107.2 million in total capital carryover in Government moneys for 2012 relates to his Department; the amount of same; if it has been spent; on what it has been spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The broadband service contracted under the NBS is a basic, affordable, scalable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme in September 2007.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is optimised in terms of resources and focus to maximise the response to social housing need.  This must be achieved in a context in which public expenditure necessarily continues to be constrained.  Nonetheless, in July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. <\/p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8 million in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department&rsquo;s Abridged Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million for the State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and an additional &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.   <\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in their capacity to attract external financial investment.   <\/p><p>  In spite of our challenging economic circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will also be provided for social housing in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000067#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Service Issues","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000067#WRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[52514\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000067#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the development of\u00a0fire service\u00a0provision in County Cork; and if there will be an increase in employment in the fire services there during the next year.","asker":"984","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>It is a statutory function of each individual fire authority, under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981, to provide a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable.  Cork County Council&rsquo;s fire services are provided primarily through a retained staffing system with a core of full time officers.  Retained fire-fighters are employees of fire authorities, and are organised to provide a fire service through a network of 21 fire stations located throughout the county. <\/p><p>  The <i>Keeping Communities Safe<\/i> (KCS) policy document, which I published as national policy in February 2013, sets out standards and norms for developing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of fire services in Ireland.  The approach in KCS is based on an &lsquo;area risk categorisation&rsquo; system which will be applied across the country by all fire services, including in Cork County.  This will result in fire station areas being graded across five bands from very high to very low risk categories.  The fire service approach to risk management, including response in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews in an area, is to correspond to this risk categorisation. <\/p><p>  I understand that the risk categorisation process has been completed for the Cork County Area and appropriate risk designations for each station area in Cork County have been determined.   To maintain local political accountability for fire services to the community, Section 26 of the Fire Services Acts provides that it is a reserved function of local authorities which maintain a fire brigade to adopt &lsquo;fire and emergency operations plans&rsquo; indicating the provision made in respect of organisation, appliances, equipment, fire stations, training, operational procedure and any such matters as may be relevant.  It is expected that the risk categorisation mentioned above will inform the next iteration of Section 26 plans.   <\/p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each county and city manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible.  Accordingly, the deployment of fire brigade staff in Cork County is a matter in the first instance for the management of Cork County Council. <\/p><p>  Since the embargo on the filling of public service posts was introduced on 24 March 2009, local authorities seek permission from my Department to fill staffing vacancies that arise within a fire service.  All requests are considered on a case by case basis, having due regard to maintaining appropriate services within budgetary and staffing constraints.  Fire-fighters numbers (1,170 full-time and 2,063 retained) have been protected from the impact of the recruitment embargo and the numbers have not changed since 2008, in contrast to the general trend in the local government sector, which has seen an approximate 25% decrease in staffing levels, including among senior fire officers.     <\/p><p>  I understand that the position in relation to staffing in Cork Fire Service is kept under constant review by Cork County Council management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000067#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Mortgages","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000067#WRR01400"},{"type":"question","counter":720,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[52555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000067#WRR01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to address the situation faced by those with shared ownership arrangements with local authorities and who are presently servicing a mortgage and paying rent to the local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This additional work is underway and I expect to make further recommendations to bring the review process to a conclusion in the near future.  Also, on foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a mortgage to rent scheme, in respect of distressed mortgages in the commercial sector, on a pilot basis in February 2012.  This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund, as General Purpose Grants.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   <\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014.  Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes must be managed.   <\/p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with a priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.  In allocating general purpose funding for 2014 I am seeking to ensure, in combination with the funding being made available through Irish Water, that these elements of support for local authorities would be maintained around 2013 levels.  It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to use General Purpose Grant revenue in line with local priorities and circumstances.     <\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000067#WRR04900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":756,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000068#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":757,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[52832\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000068#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason his Department has spent &euro;172 million less on the capital side than was profiled in the November Exchequer figures.

The Revised Estimates for Public Services 2013, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform earlier this year, provide for gross capital expenditure of &euro;726 million in respect of my Department in 2013.  At the end of November, capital spending by my Department was behind the profile established earlier in the year.  Expenditure under the Water Services Investment Programme in 2013 has been less than anticipated due to slower than expected progress on water services capital projects during the year;\u00a0work on the implementation of the Water Sector Reform Programme, in particular on the establishment of Irish Water, has required considerable input from the local authorities and this has impacted on the progress of the Programme.\u00a0 In addition, drawdown by local authorities of housing funding has been slower than expected. <\/p><p>  I expect that there will be some further expenditure\u00a0under the water, housing and other capital programmes before year end.

In this regard, local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Safety Act 1981, the Building Control Act 1990 and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant in relation to fire safety arrangements in residential buildings, and have successfully used such powers to deal with a number of instances of non-compliance. <\/p><p>  I have also amended the Building Control Regulations to require, in respect of building projects commencing on and from I March 2014, lodgement of design documentation, inspections during construction, overseen by registered construction professionals, and certificates of compliance signed by designers, builders and assigned certifiers.

In relation to concerns about street crime the figures show a substantial reduction in public order offences of 14.6%. In addition, the incidence of assault causing harm fell by 9.3%. <\/p><p>  The commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackling violent crimes is set out in the National Policing Plan for 2013 which includes objectives to address all forms of violent crime through strong enforcement and crime prevention strategies, working with all relevant partners.

In particular, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda&iacute; with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda&iacute; to tackle misuse of alcohol. These include provisions to allow Garda&iacute; seize alcohol to prevent underage drinking in public places and to forestall public disorder or damage to property.<\/p><p>  In relation to violence aimed at the Garda&iacute; themselves, there is specific legislation in place to deal with assaults of, or threats to, emergency workers in front line positions, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Act sets out the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account. <\/p><p>  Before a final determination a number of factors may be taken into account including:<blockquote>  - the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates;<br \/><br \/>  - the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;<br \/><br \/>  - the period of the sentence served by the person;<br \/><br \/>  - the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;<br \/><br \/>  - the person's previous criminal record;<br \/><br \/>  - the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release;<br \/><br \/>  - the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release;<br \/><br \/>  - any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release;<br \/><br \/>  - the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;<br \/><br \/>  - the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release;<br \/><br \/>  - the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.<\/blockquote>  Temporary release assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to prisoners. It is an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each application for temporary release for whatever reason, including those referred to in the Deputy's question, is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.<\/p><p>  The Act also provides that,  I may consider prisoners for temporary release where I am of the opinion that it is necessary and expedient in order to ensure the good government of the prison concerned and to maintain good order as well as humane conditions within the prison concerned.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have announced a number of initiatives and programmes to alleviate over-crowding in the prison system. The Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan (2012-2015), which is publicly available, outlines a number of measures to be undertaken including the Community Return Scheme, a closer working relationship with the Probation Service and a more structured approach to Temporary Release.<\/p><p>  The Community Return Scheme, which was first piloted in 2011,  has been rolled out nationally across all prisons.  Almost 750 prisoners have taken part in the initiative since it commenced with 526 prisoners now having completed the programme. On 4  December  2013, there were 117 prisoners on the Scheme.<\/p><p>  In addition to Community Returns, the Unlocking Community Alternatives Scheme (UCAS) and the Community Support Scheme have been set up in Cork and Mountjoy Prisons in an attempt to address the recidivism levels of those serving sentences of under 12 months from those catchment areas. The UCAS and Community Support Scheme groups are comprised of a number of prison-based personnel, representing the discipline grades and therapeutic services, as well as Community Support Workers based in the community. These Schemes will see a focus on working with short term sentenced prisoners - assisting with issues such as housing, medical care, substance abuse, training needs, etc. The aim is to increase support to prisoners - prior to their release from prison, upon their release and then for a period after their release in order to help break the cycle of re-offending.

The Irish Prison Service is also represented on seven of the Regional Homeless Consultative Fora established under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 2009. Through these fora, the Irish Prison Service, in partnership with the Probation Service, has been working to ensure that the unique circumstances of homeless offenders are taken into account in the development and provision of preventative and other supporting actions for persons who are vulnerable to homelessness.  <\/p><p>  With regard to women prisoners specifically, in recent years, in addition to the direct work of probation officers on accommodation issues, a weekly clinic service has been provided in the D&oacute;chas Centre by the Department of Social Protection Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Person's Unit (HPU).  This service is co-funded by the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Department of Social Protection and four local authorities. Referrals to this service generally are at the pre-release stage and emergency and other accommodation options, supplementary benefits and fast tracked medical cards are arranged by the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) who provide the information and clinic services. There were 241 female prisoners assisted by the HPU in-reach (CWOs) in D&oacute;chas Centre in 2012. These 241 prisoners account for 1,138 interactions with this service. The HPU service is invaluable for the successful resettlement of offenders and a vital component of pre-release planning. Focus Ireland operates a homeless in-reach service in Limerick Prison, which also accommodates female prisoners. The Focus Ireland service provides a case management and pre-settlement service for prisoners.  The service supports participants in accessing appropriate services and accommodation on the pathway to independent living.<\/p><p>  In addition I would like to inform the Deputy that as part of the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan, 2012-2015, the Service has committed itself to work in partnership with the Probation Service and other stakeholders in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors which include Dublin City Council, the Office of Public Works, the Health Service Executive and City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board in order to develop a strategy for dealing with women offenders and to put in place a targeted response in relation to homelessness for these women. The engagement between the Irish Prison Service and these agencies to date, has in part, concentrated on the provision of a Centre in the greater Dublin area which would target women with specific needs and would provide:<blockquote>- Supported accommodation,<br \/><br \/>- Intensive case management (temporary and long term),<br \/><br \/>- Specialist addiction and mental health support, with primary care teams, and<br \/><br \/>- Day services with drop in and structured programmes, including training and educational programmes.<\/blockquote>Priority access will be given for women from the D&oacute;chas Centre.<\/p><p>  In relation to the development of a centre for women, the Irish Prison Service are working with the following:<blockquote><i>Strategic Partners<\/i>:<br \/><br \/>  Dublin Region Homeless Executive<br \/><br \/>  Health Service Executive<br \/><br \/>  The Probation Service<br \/><br \/>  City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board<br \/><br \/><i>Operational Group<\/i>:<br \/><br \/>  The Probation Service<br \/><br \/>  Dublin City Council<br \/><br \/>  City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board<br \/><br \/>  Novas Initiatives<br \/><br \/>  Depaul Ireland<br \/><br \/>  Heath Service Executive<br \/><br \/>  Department of Social Protection<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000070#WRU02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Justice Strategy","counter":876,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000070#WRU02050"},{"type":"question","counter":877,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[53004\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000070#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the impact of the Garda diversion programme on anti-social behaviour and youth crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1038","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":878,"content":"<p>The Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner. The objective of the Diversion Programme is to divert any child who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal or anti social behaviour from committing further offences or engaging in further anti social behaviour. This is done by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The Programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and the programme also pays regard to the needs of the victims of youth offending.<\/p><p>  The Programme is supported by 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects.  These projects are nationwide, community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives run in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and funded\/overseen by my Department&lsquo;s unit within the Irish Youth Justice Service. These projects seek to divert young people from involvement in anti-social and\/or criminal behaviour. They aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the projects. The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &quot;at risk&quot; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of  these young people remaining within the criminal justice system. <\/p><p>  The Annual Reports of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme under Part 4 of the Act 2001, as amended, include details of the number of incidents of youth crime and the number of individual children referred to the Programme each year.

It must also be borne in mind that modern organised criminal groupings are transnational in nature and engage in a wide range of disparate criminal activities. It can, therefore, be difficult to identify definitive numbers of groupings and members involved in such illegal and covert activity at any particular point in time.<\/p><p>  However, I can assure the Deputy that the operation of organised crime groups is closely monitored on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that tackling these groups remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013.<\/p><p>  In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle organised crime through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle their operations. This involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.   An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also maintains close liaison with other law enforcement agencies internationally in this area.<\/p><p>  The activities of these units are highlighted in the annual reports of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, e.g. in 2012, the Organised Crime Unit alone undertook 387 targeted operations against criminal groups. While the challenges and threat posed by such groups remains clear, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to arrest and bring those involved in such criminality before the Courts where substantial sentences continue to be handed down for serious crime offences.<\/p><p>  Our law enforcement operations are underpinned by a comprehensive framework of criminal law measures which are being fully utilised by the Garda&iacute;. In this regard I should highlight the recent publication of legislation to provide for the establishment of a DNA database to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling crime. The intelligence generated from this database will be of particular value to the Garda&iacute;, and will greatly assist in the investigation of a wide range of serious crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the most recent recorded crime statistics, which were released at the end of October show falling trends in the offence numbers for most categories of crime, including offences relating to  homicide, kidnapping, weapons and explosives, and drugs related offences. These crime figures reflect well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and demonstrate that those involved in criminal gangs are being vigorously opposed. In concluding, I can fully assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to actively pursue all persons involved in criminal gang activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000071#WRV02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":926,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000071#WRV02950"},{"type":"question","counter":927,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[53089\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000071#WRV03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total number of vacancies at all ranks waiting to be filled at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.<\/p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. Finally, the draft Rural Development Regulation sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.<\/p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.  As part of this process, I have met with a number of stakeholders, including the Irish Farmers Association.<\/p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required. I expect to make decisions in relation to the measures to be supported under the new RDP by the end of this year, and to submit a draft programme to the Commission in early 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000073#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Mergers","counter":999,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000073#WRX01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1000,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[52772\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000073#WRX01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the stage of the proposed merger of Coillte with Bord na M&oacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Enterprise Ireland administers this funding which supports both greenfield and expansion projects in food. <\/p><p>  It funds a range of key programmes delivered by Enterprise Ireland supporting innovation, sales and marketing skills, strategic thinking and competitiveness, including Lean Training programmes, Leadership4 Growth and Innovation Vouchers.   <\/p><p>  DAFM representatives sit on the EI committees for Investment and Jobs Expansion.<\/p><p><b>Research and Development<\/b><\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland sits on the industry led Food Research Expert Advisory Group operated by my Department which developed the <i>Food Research Ireland<\/i> strategic research agenda (SRA) used to guide the content for the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM) calls.  In addition, EI sits on the overarching Research Committee which conducts the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> stage (short listing projects for possible funding by DAFM) in the evaluation process for DAFM competitive research programmes.<\/p><p>  In turn representatives from my Department bring their expertise to bear as members of the Enterprise Ireland Industrial Research Commercialisation Committee, which deals with the funding for applied research and commercialisation involving the public research organisations, collaborative research and industry led networks. This committee has supported innovation with pan-industry initiatives, including the Food Health Ireland Technology Centre (parts 1 &amp;amp; 2), the currently developing Dairy Processing Technology Centre and a similar project regarding a potential centre for meat processing.  My Department also participates on the EI R&amp;amp;D Committee concerning support for in-company research.<\/p><p><b>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)<\/b><\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the attraction of international investment to Ireland and maintains a team in Ireland, supported by colleagues in the market place.  The FDI function is a key area of collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and my Department.

These swaps are completed by the Department using the EU FIDES fishery database system. <\/p><p>  The third reason for swaps is at the end of year where a quota has been exceeded  and  any opportunity to address this overfishing is used through  completing swops with other Member States. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000075#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1086,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000075#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1087,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[53149\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000075#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he has taken to date to address the suspension of the fishing fleet in Kilmore, County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1088,"content":"<p>Operational issues in relation to sea fisheries control are a matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).

It is important to note that many children and adults with a disability can be very effectively supported within mainstream child and adult health services.  <\/p><p>  Dyspraxia is a developmental co-ordination disorder that affects movement and co-ordination.  For some children, dyspraxia can affect their learning capacity.  For this reason they may require additional supports in the school setting to keep up with their classmates.  A comprehensive range of supports is in place in our school system to supports these children.  <\/p><p>  From a health perspective, there are a number of therapies that can make it easier for people with dyspraxia to cope.  These include speech and language therapy, to improve speech and communication skills, and occupational therapy to find ways to remain independent and complete everyday tasks.  Such therapy services do not necessarily have to be delivered through specialist disability providers and are frequently accessed through Primary Care Teams and community therapy services.        <\/p><p>  The Dyspraxia Association is just one of a range of organisations around the country at present providing supports to specific diagnostic groups who do not receive HSE funding.  Funding of these types of organisations is an issue that is under active and on-going consideration by the HSE.  Pending approval of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014, it is not possible to predict the service levels and funding to be provided next year for the disability sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000076#WRAA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000076#WRAA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[52511\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000076#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a full medical card will be reinstated in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1136,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Supports are tailored on a case-by-case basis by a job coach and can include on-the-job training , social skills training, assistance with travel to and from work, assistive technology and other supports necessary to make the employment successful, for both the employer and the employee.

On the 5th of December, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the NTA announced\u00a0that about 10% of publicly subvented (PSO) bus services will be tendered out with the new services commencing in the summer of 2016.<\/p><p>  It is recognised that there are a number of concerns in relation to potential tendering for PSO services.\u00a0 These include the impact on industrial relations and cost savings measures within CIE at a general level and the specific implications of Transfer of Undertakings legislation (TUPE) and related issues.\u00a0\u00a0However, it must be recognised that the proposals outlined in the consultation process are relatively modest and there will be a long-lead in before any tendering takes effect. Furthermore, it is of course open to the\u00a0two incumbent companies to compete for any tendered routes, so it should not be assumed that there will be any reductions in staff numbers or that TUPE will even arise.<\/p><p>  Following the announcement by the NTA on 5th December,\u00a0these issues need to be addressed by it and the bus companies through constructive engagement with the unions in the course of the procurement process over the next two years.\u00a0 I undertook to the trade unions at our meeting that I would contact the NTA to seek to have such a structured engagement put in place and I\u00a0wrote to the Chairman of the NTA on 26th November to that end.  It is important to remember that it will be open to Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus to tender for these contracts. The winning tenderer will be required to deliver a specified\u00a0service under which the timetables, fares and standards of service will be set down by the NTA. The intention is that a better service can be procured for the same PSO subvention that is currently provided, or that the same service can be provided for a lesser cost to the tax-payer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000081#WRFF02300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1382,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 558 to 560, inclusive, answered with Question No. 549.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Safety","counter":1384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000082#WRGG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1385,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[52523\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013121000082#WRGG00200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if part-time bus drivers are subject to a specific directive regarding their working hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1386,"content":"<p>The working time rules applicable to all bus\u00a0drivers,\u00a0full-time or part-time,\u00a0depend on whether or not the drivers concerned come within the scope of\u00a0Regulation (EC) 561\/2006\u00a0of\u00a0the European Parliament and\u00a0of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport, and are therefore required to use a tachograph when operating.\u00a0    \u00a0<\/p><p>  If the drivers are within scope of Regulation (EC) 561\/2006, their driving and resting times are further regulated by Directive 2002\/15\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities.
