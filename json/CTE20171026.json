It concerns the IDA's recent appearance at the committee.  It had been asked for a more detailed note on how it verifies the job creation numbers it presented to this committee.  There was some discussion on how the IDA calculates what jobs are created from its clients and how ConnectIreland does it.  I have forwarded two notes or forms to the secretariat.  It is extraordinary, because what the IDA said when it was before the committee was that 14,000 jobs were created last year.  The IDA verifies the jobs by asking the relevant company to fill in a form.  The form, which I forwarded to the secretariat, is an annual employment survey.  It simply has two boxes.  The checks involve making sure that the form was filled in.  The form is sent out to companies and the companies respond by saying how many jobs were created.  There is no follow-up in terms of linking it with revenue, payroll or PRSI.  That can be juxtaposed with the process that ConnectIreland is asked to go through.  It has a responsibility to identify how the jobs are created.  The company has to prepare a spreadsheet with the name of the employee, employee position, start date and end date.  The IDA, at its discretion, can talk to the companies.  It can get permission to view payroll reports, bank statements, latest P30s and samples of employee contracts.  It is much more robust.  It certainly is the case that for ConnectIreland, a very detailed process was in place to prove that the jobs that were created were actually created.  However, in the case of the IDA, a straightforward self-assessment letter is sent out and that seems to be the process.<\/p> <p>  This is important.  I am not doubting the figures or saying that the figures that were presented to us were not genuine.  However, I am concerned about the process.  It is questionable whether the figure presented to us can be independently verified.  These are figures which guide policy.  Perhaps we should wait until the detailed note comes back from the IDA, but it appears that there are double standards here in terms of how the IDA requests ConnectIreland to verify its jobs while having a much simpler process itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I understand and completely appreciate what the Deputy has said.  I received a similar copy of that correspondence yesterday but it has not been circulated to the committee as it arrived too late.  However, we have written to the IDA directly on this topic, following on from the earlier correspondence from ConnectIreland.  We want a detailed response on that, and we will forward this documentation to it as well.  It will be circulated to the members of the committee shortly.  The question that arises is what happens when the questionnaires are not returned.  What figure does the IDA take in that instance?  I am very interested in the questionnaires that are not signed by the companies and returned.  We want to check the verification, but when forms do not come back, we want to know how the IDA comes up with a number.  I am sure it has some mechanism to count the jobs in particular companies.  We will add that to our list of questions for the IDA.  I have no doubt that we will have a detailed discussion when we receive the reply from the IDA and will proceed from there.  We will ask the secretariat to encourage the IDA to respond as promptly as possible.<\/p> <p>  That arises out the minutes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>While it might be better to raise this issue when discussing the work programme, will we deal with the issues that arose around the Eversheds memo and the legal advice received now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B00900","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>As it is in the work programme, we definitely will come to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B01100","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We will move on to correspondence.

Correspondence item No. 820C (i &ndash; ii) is correspondence dated 11 October 2017 from Ms Niamh Larkin, director of audit in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, updating the committee on correspondence regarding Meath County Council.  A matter relating to the legal status of certain companies that have contracts with Meath County Council had been raised by an individual and this was referred by the previous committee to the Department in January 2016.  The letter advises that the local government auditor for Meath County Council met the correspondent in July 2016 and has corresponded with him a number of times from January 2016 to date.  She advised the correspondent in July 2016 that his correspondence did not fall within the definition of an objection, and on 14 July 2017 she confirmed to the correspondent that it was not intended to take any further action.  A copy of the correspondence to the individual is attached.  I propose we note that.  It has been looked at locally by the local government audit.  I propose we note it and move on because Meath County Council is not within the remit of this committee.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence item No. 821C (i &ndash; ii), dated 17 October 2017, from Ms Patricia Quinn, managing director, Benefacts, enclosing information for the committee about the database of Irish non-profits comprising extensive governance, regulatory and financial data and analysis.

The secretariat has proposed having representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS, the funders of the ETBs, attend the first session together.  I would like everyone to be present for the full meeting.  In other words, I want the chairmen and chief executives of the two education and training boards to be present for the session with the Department and SOLAS.

I want all the groups to be fully aware of what is being said, although we will provide time for different sections.  We do not want to take a silo approach.  We want everyone present throughout.  We will start the meeting with an information session with the Department and SOLAS.

However, I also asked the secretariat to choose the best education and training board and Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board seems to be doing its business properly.  If it can do things right, why can the rest of them not do things right too?  We want to pick out some elements of good practice and tell the other boards they do not have any excuses because their counterparts elsewhere are doing things right.  We want to have a contrast.  Rather than bringing in the bottom half of the class, to use an educational term, we are bringing in examples of good practice.

I am fascinated about where the money comes from to do that kind of thing.  There is undoubtedly an issue.  It is important that if Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board comes in, we are all circulated with the 2010 report beforehand because we need to know the history as much as the current issue that is under investigation.  It is also useful to look not just at geographic areas but the number of schools.  An area might be small but might have many schools that are under its remit.

The complication that arose was the necessity for clarity on a memo that has come into the possession of the committee and is now a document of the committee as I understand it.  It has been circulated to us and forms part of our papers.  Clarity was required about the extent to which or whether legal privilege applied to that document.  I also understood that we would seek legal clarity, a legal opinion or legal advice on that matter.

Second, and this is important, when Mr. McEnery was here he did speak about the meeting so that notwithstanding the notes he did talk about what happened at that meeting.  His response to a question as to whether a boycott of the fair deal scheme was discussed was yes, it was, but he was not party to it and did not support it.  There were only two parties in the room, himself and Nursing Homes Ireland, so if he did not initiate, support or take part in a discussion on a boycott, and he acknowledges that discussion took place, then Nursing Homes Ireland did.

The figure for nursing home support scheme - fair deal private nursing homes only - is &euro;623 million in 2016.  The cost of public nursing homes is &euro;333 million.  That is a bigger figure than fair deal.  Not everyone who is in a nursing home is on the fair deal scheme.

I am accompanied by Ms Colley, the chief officer of CHO area 5, which is the relevant CHO area.  She joined the HSE in September 2015.  Therefore, it is important to point out that she would not have had any involvement in the matters in the south east prior to that date.<br\/><br\/>I am mindful that, in addressing these concerns, I have taken the time to consider a number of issues addressed to committee members by the provider in correspondence dated 4 October 2017.  It is important to preface my opening statement in the knowledge that matters of concern for this committee are also germane to the statutory investigation that is sitting.<br\/><br\/>In addressing the matters in the service provider's correspondence to the committee, I wish to provide important background and context leading to the final 20-page report and appendices issued to me, as commissioner of the review, by Deloitte on 15 September 2017.<br\/><br\/>During the course of my opening statement to the committee in February of last year, I discussed levels of funding for the voluntary provider for the years 2009 to 2015, inclusive.  The budget for the voluntary provider involved was set out together with a comparison of the percentage increase or decrease in budget relative to the percentage increase or reductions across the area and nationally.  In the course of the meeting, the then Chairman stated:<\/p><blockquote>I understand that Mr. O'Brien [me, of course] is going to have a discussion with it [the provider] and I know he will be fair about it.  I think when you look at the funding figures that you quoted in your opening statement, and factor in the work that had to be done and the care that had to be given, you will find that its funding actually decreased over the period.  I will not argue with you about the figures, but I am going to ask you to examine that table at some stage and be prepared to inform the next Committee of Public Accounts of the position.<\/blockquote> <p>Following the committee meeting, the figures were disputed by the voluntary provider in question.  As part of an engagement with the organisation, I gave a commitment that I would undertake an independent external review of funding, to which the provider was agreeable.  I commissioned Deloitte, an internationally recognised organisation, to undertake the review in accordance with the following terms of reference, which relate to the cost of care from 2009 to 2016 for a specific individual in the care of a service provider, and the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider from 2009 to 2015.<br\/><br\/>I now wish to address the serious allegations made by the service provider in its correspondence to the committee regarding the independence of the report.  Deloitte, as part of its methodology, undertook to engage with the provider and relevant HSE personnel and requested information from both parties.  As part of the process deployed, Deloitte exchanged a draft document with both parties and had further engagements with them regarding clarifications and inputs to the draft.  I understand that the methodology employed by Deloitte is the norm when undertaking such reviews.  That is, it is a reasonable standard to expect that both parties to the review would have the opportunity to comment and offer feedback for &quot;consideration&quot;, following which the independent reviewer has to decide on what will or will not be included in the final report, having taken into account the information and views of the parties to the review.  This is precisely what Deloitte undertook as an independent and reputable professional services firm.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding this, and given the gravity of the concerns expressed and the assertions contained in the provider's correspondence, I felt it important to seek written assurances from Deloitte as to its view of the assertions made.  I therefore wish to read into the record of the committee the following response received from Deloitte:<\/p><blockquote>In support of our findings in respect of part (b) of the TORs (our analysis of the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider from 2009 to 2015), our report includes the detail of the amounts initially reported by HSE to the PAC in respect of funding provided over the period adjusted for funding for one-off and new services which shows the real reduction in funding for like for like services over the period and is consistent with what was in the draft report.<br \/><br \/>There was an additional table (table 3.3) in the draft report which further adjusted the funding received for the shortfall determined under section (a) of the TORs.<br \/><br \/>We determined that further adjusting the table for this shortfall was confusing and could be misleading as the report already clearly set out the shortfall related to part (a) of our TOR.  The removal of this table was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.<br \/><br \/>As the report was prepared for the HSE, we considered it appropriate that additional information be included in the report which provided the HSE's context to our findings.  It is not uncommon in such reports to obtain responses to findings from those subject to the review and the report clearly sets out that this information was provided by the HSE and not subject to independent review by Deloitte.<br \/><br \/>It was not in our TOR to conclude as to whether the shortfall in the funding for Grace was effectively an additional cut in funding to the body or deliberately done because of the whistleblowing, this is a matter for the Commission of Investigation.<\/blockquote> <p>Having regard to the above response from Deloitte, I wish to address concerns raised regarding material - in this instance, tables relating to financial data - being in the draft report for consideration as distinct from the final report issued by the independent reviewer, Deloitte.  As I have referenced in terms of Deloitte's correspondence, the information that was contained in table 3.3 of the draft report had already been dealt with in the report and was removed to avoid confusion.  The removal of this table was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.<\/p><p>In its final report, Deloitte reproduced the table of figures provided by me in my opening statement to the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February last year.  These figures were subsequently disputed by the provider.  The Deloitte report at 6.4, page 17, states the following on these figures:<\/p><blockquote>From our analysis of the breakdown of the funding provided by the HSE to the Service Provider, we are satisfied that the figures set out in Table [6.1] above are in respect of total funding.&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>The report further states at 6.5, page 17:<\/p><blockquote>The Service Provider has advised us that whilst there was an overall 18% increase in the level of funding in 2015 compared with 2014, this increase is after the provision of new services.<\/blockquote><p>I take from this that the figures as presented by the HSE to this committee in February 2016 were correct.<br\/><br\/>I have accepted the final report as issued to me by Deloitte.  I remain of the view that the evidence in this report indicates the service provider was treated fairly in comparison with other similar service providers in the period under review.  I am satisfied, based on assurances from Deloitte, that any adjustment between the draft report of May 2017 and the final report was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.  It is also my view that any remaining concerns should be dealt with through the Farrelly commission, which is established in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1509004800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Deputy Sean Fleming resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane has indicated his wish to speak.

Maybe Mr. O'Brien should correct the record of the committee and confirm that only the commission of investigation will make the determination, and it may influence whether the providers get an apology.

Again, before this committee in 2016, I indicated that in relation to those persons who had been harmed and were the subject of the Devine review, the executive - the HSE - would take a particularly positive approach to ensuring that appropriate restitution-compensation was paid for the failings in care, and the consequences of failings in care, in the south east, related not just to Grace but to a number of people.  Consequently, the approach to this case was not a hostile defensive approach but one, working with the State Claims Agency, which sought to put to right all of the issues regarding the deficiencies in the care that had led to the harm suffered by this person.  Consequently, it was right that the person would be provided with restitution which also would compensate the person for the cost of the care the person had received.

As we approach the flu season, it is important that those in the at risk groups - health care workers and those among the elderly population - avail of the flu vaccine.  There has been some controversy this week about whether it is exactly the right match.  The truth is that it is never exactly the right match, but the flu vaccine confers protection.  It can reduce the number of hospital admissions among the elderly, in particular, by between 50% and 60% and also reduce the number of deaths among those who contract the flu by up to 80%.  Therefore, there is a real and fundamental benefit both for the individual and our society.  I am very happy that this place of employment facilitates everyone who works in it through ease of access to the flu vaccine and hope other employers will also do so.

It is timely and important in ensuring the effective spending of public moneys in a way that will provide maximum benefit for those who use the services of the agencies involved.  <\/p><p>Mr. O'Brien, director general of the HSE, is joined in this session by Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer and deputy director general; Ms Rosarii Mannion, national director, human resources; Mr. John Cregan, head of compliance; Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary affairs division; Mr. Kevin Cleary, HSE compliance division, and Mr. Michael Flynn, national director, internal audit division.  We are also joined from the Department of Health by Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary general, and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Mr. Barry O'Brien and Mr. Tom Clarke.  <\/p><p>By virtue of 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Before I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement, I point out that it is almost 11.50 a.m. and that there will be block voting in the D&aacute;il in approximately one hour when we will have to suspend the sitting.  It is inevitable we will have to resume afterwards as we will certainly not have our business transacted within the next hour.  I am putting people on notice that we will be back after the block voting and a lunch break.  <\/p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor general to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#R00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":527,"content":"<p>The HSE funds over 2,270 service providers to deliver services on its behalf, as provided for in sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The service providers include large acute hospitals, as well as services for people with a disability and older persons.  They provide mental health, social inclusion, palliative care, primary care and health and well-being services.  The funding to pay for these services is allocated to HSE annually from the health Vote.  In 2016, &euro;3.8 billion, or around 28% of the HSE's Vote, was for the provision of payments to agencies.  It included a sum of &euro;2 billion to be shared between 16 acute hospitals and a sum of &euro;1.8 billion for voluntary and community groups.<\/p><p> Chapter 19 of the report on the accounts of public services for 2016 examines the HSE's framework for monitoring grants to service providers, drawing on the results of the audit of the financial statements of the HSE for 2016.  The current grant funding system has evolved from a long established model of service provision, whereby the State relies substantially on the voluntary sector to provide certain health services.  The formal arrangements with service providers are usually put in place by negotiation rather than through competitive processes.  The HSE has two types of contractual arrangement with service providers, depending of the level of funding provided.  Service arrangements are put in place with larger service providers, those operating on a for-profit basis and out-of-State service providers.  In 2016 approximately 570 agencies in receipt of &euro;3.75 billion were managed under these arrangements.  Grant aid agreements are put in place with service providers in receipt of funding below &euro;250,000 a year.  Approximately 1,700 agencies in receipt of just over &euro;32 million were managed under these arrangements in 2016.<\/p><p> The HSE has established a complex framework for the monitoring and oversight of these arrangements that is currently administered and overseen by nine community health care organisations, referred to as CHOs, located around the country and by six of the seven hospital groups, as summarised in Figure 19.1 of my report.  Progress has been made by the HSE in putting in place a systematic process for the oversight and monitoring of grant funded service providers.  However, the has report found that specified procedures within the HSE's monitoring framework were not applied consistently.  For example, funding CHOs did not have details of all of the key governance arrangements for a sample of service providers examined.  A service provider with multiple locations can receive funding from more than one of the HSE's CHOs and be subject to separate monitoring by each funding CHO.  The examination found that in these circumstances the identification of responsibilities in the HSE for monitoring and oversight was difficult.  The results of various audits and external reviews and compliance statements made by service providers highlight a number of governance issues arising across the sector, in particular non-compliance with procurement rules and regulations, non-compliance with public sector pay polices and the absence of internal audit functions.  Service agreements specify key performance indicators and reporting frequency.  Required key performance indicator returns were on file in just over half of the sample cases examined, of which over one quarter were not at the frequency specified in the service arrangement.  In the sample cases examined required audited financial statements had not been provided for the funding CHO in just under one quarter of service arrangements and grant aid agreements.<\/p><p> The report makes a number of recommendations in regard to the HSE's framework for oversight and monitoring, including that the HSE be satisfied that service providers have appropriate governance structures in place; that the service arrangements clearly set out key performance indicators and associated monitoring arrangements, including the responsibilities of both parties; that the monitoring arrangements specified in the service arrangements be complied with; and that the roles and responsibilities for monitoring be clearer where a service provider receives funding from more than one CHO.  The HSE has indicated that it accepted all of the recommendations made.  The director general will be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Before I call Mr. O'Brien, perhaps Mr. McCarthy might explain the phrase \"service arrangements are put in place with larger service providers, those operating on a for-profit basis and out-of-State service providers\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#S00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Do you mean out-of-State service providers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Yes.

The Chairman has introduced my team.<\/p> <p>  The HSE previously acknowledged that it had concerns about aspects of the monitoring and oversight arrangements for the grants paid to outside agencies.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is, therefore, timely and will further assist the HSE in ensuring both the HSE managers responsible for the oversight and monitoring of grants and the agencies in receipt of them will continue to work towards a comprehensive and effective oversight process.  The HSE has provided a briefing paper for the committee which describes the overall governance system in place for the management of the relationship with funded agencies and outlines the various elements introduced to ensure greater accountability and compliance with public sector norms.<\/p> <p>  The HSE's relationship with the voluntary sector should not be framed in purely negative terms.  I highlight the valuable role the sector plays in the delivery and development of health and personal social services.  The HSE funds 2,279 section 38 and section 39 agencies.  The reality is that the State depends on the voluntary sector for the delivery of many services and voluntary organisations are often the first to identify gaps in services.  At this stage, the agencies accept that expenditure of public funds and, just as importantly for their reputations, other charitable funds will attract greater scrutiny by the funder and the public at large.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's audit shows that there is adequate specification of outputs, that is, that the HSE is clear on what it expects in terms of the quantum and quality of services for the grant to be paid, but that some further work is required on other aspects of the oversight system.<\/p> <p>  The audit report speaks for itself regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the HSE's approach and performance.  I do not propose, therefore, to recite the detail of the report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has made three recommendations: the need for the HSE to include an assessment of the effectiveness of governance structures in its monitoring procedures; a need to highlight responsibilities for the monitoring of key performance indicators; and a need for compliance with the monitoring arrangements specified in service arrangements.  These recommendations are agreed to and progress on their implementation is being made.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges that the annual compliance statement process, the external governance reviews commissioned by the HSE, the HSE internal audits and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this examination and previous audits all point towards a number of governance issues arising across the sector, in particular non-compliance with procurement rules and regulations, non-compliance with public sector pay policies and the absence of internal audit functions.<\/p><p>To address these governance issues, the HSE has taken steps to enable agencies to have greater access to the HSE procurement systems and has provided training and guidance to external agency staff.  The executive has also taken steps to maintain the focus on compliance with public sector pay policy by all agencies and it will continue to subject agencies to greater scrutiny, in particular, through the HSE's national HR processes.  The HSE has also taken steps to emphasise a requirement for the establishment of an appropriate internal audit function, or the accessing of internal audit resources, as set down in the service arrangement.<br\/><br\/>There has been significant progress in effectively overseeing and monitoring the payment of grants, and compliance levels by agencies have improved.  The HSE will continue to develop its systems and it will, for example, establish contract management support units in the community health care organisations, CHOs, to ensure that matters such as the recommended frequency of monitoring meetings is met in all cases and that the oversight of multi-agreement agencies is co-ordinated.<br\/><br\/>The HSE will also further develop its IT system to streamline the oversight and monitoring administrative processes.  However, irrespective of how sophisticated and extensive the HSE systems are, the HSE cannot guarantee that every agency it funds will meet all its obligations.  In the past, the challenges faced by the sector <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the HSE are rooted in governance issues.  Good governance is fundamental to the effective delivery of services and the sustainability of agencies.  The HSE is not, and does not wish to be, the regulator for the sector and neither does the HSE wish to micromanage external agencies.  The HSE, like all public funders relies, and must be able to rely, on agencies' audited accounts.  The importance of a robust statutory external audit process cannot be overestimated.  Like all public funders, the HSE cannot audit all agencies as that would require an army of auditors.  While agencies should be accountable for the grants made available to them, they should continue to be independent and they should not be so constrained that the innovation and drive they bring to services is lost.<br\/><br\/>Once again, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and I can confirm that the HSE is working to implement the recommendations made and address the concerns identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#S02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

It remains the case that what the internal auditors found was the flagrant misuse of charitably given funds, not HSE funds.  That went right to the heart of the honesty of the HSE's relationship with that organisation, which meant that it could no longer have such a relationship.  That does have generalisable lessons, to use the phrase I used at the time, which does affect the way both internal audit, management and the compliance unit relate to those types of organisations.<\/p> <p>  On the other issues, on a quarterly basis the national director for internal audit presents a report at the national leadership team meeting of the HSE which covers all the audits concluded in that period, with a summary of all the findings, graded by classification.

That is what I want to establish.<\/p> <p>  There is a table on the screen which shows the 19 audited reports which framed the basis of the previous table which generalised the areas of concern.  The types of issues identified by internal audit are a high number of bank accounts, incomplete accounting records, transactions not authorised at appropriate levels, expenditure on gifts and entertainment, poor audit trails over credit card expenditure, absence of policies and procedure regarding conflicts of interest of board members and confidential disclosures, board members not completing Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, returns, salary payments in excess of the Department of Expenditure and Public Reform pay scales, senior staff in receipt of allowances and round-sum payments, staff in receipt of bonus payments, procurement issues including contracts awarded without competitive procurement processes, and documentary evidence not retained for the awarding of contracts.

I ask the Chairman to indicate when I have three minutes remaining as I wish to address a couple of issues.<\/p> <p>  We cannot throw all of these organisations under a bus because we need the services that some of them provide.  At the same time, we are in a pitiful position in terms of providing the level of oversight that would give members of the public the peace of mind they are entitled to in respect of expenditure of &euro;4 billion per annum, which a substantial sum of money.  If we continue with a process that is, by consensus, insufficient, with Mr. Flynn completing 19 or 20 audits each year, it will take us 113 years to get through all these organisations.  The HSE has provided a useful table setting out the audits carried out on 19 organisations, which shows that multiple breaches were recorded in three or more areas in almost 65% of audits.  It stands to reason that there is a very serious problem with governance and, potentially, misappropriation of funds in at least some organisations which have been designed to feather the nests of individuals.<\/p> <p>  This is a matter of grave concern, which requires a wholesale investigation.  I mean no disrespect to the witnesses but it appears the HSE is not capable of carrying out such an investigation.  An army may well be required to do this given the public interest involved, the &euro;4 billion at stake with the percentage of breaches emerging each year.  Last year, the examination carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General made similar findings.  I spent two years locked in a room adjacent to this one discussing banking.  This sounds similar to the Central Bank light touch approach which involves learning and teaching rather than imposing sanctions.  This approach does not serve us well, as we saw in the difficulties with tracker mortgages this week.  We, and those who come after us, will spend the next 113 years identifying the same difficulties.  With respect, the Department of Health and Minister must scope out what needs to be done to adequately manage these organisations and have an appropriate system in place.

I have a few questions, Deputy Connolly may wish to speak again and Deputy Murphy may have some final questions.  I will address the audit side.  In the HSE's annual report and financial statement for 2016, the section dealing with the directorate members' report is on page 135 and it addresses the membership of the audit committee.  The following individuals are members of the audit committee: Mr. Peter Cross, from the private sector, who is the chairman; Mr. Joe Mooney, former principal officer in the Department of Finance; Mr. John Hynes, former Secretary General of the then Department of Social Protection; Mr. David Smith, principal officer in the Department of Health; Mr. Stephen McGovern from CRH; Dr. Sheelah Ryan, public health physician and former CEO of HSE West; Professor Patricia Barker, chartered accountant, director of Tallaght hospital and former vice president of academic affairs in DCU; and Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, the HSE's national director of mental health.<\/p> <p>  To summarise that, there are two HSE staff or former staff, three current or former civil servants and three from outside the HSE.  The HSE's audit committee is for all of the HSE and not just section 38 and 39 bodies.  The HSE has a throughput of &euro;14 billion or &euro;15 billion per annum.  There are only three non-HSE or current civil servants on the audit committee.  Why is the number so low?  Is that in legislation?  Such a big organisation would benefit from having a majority of its members not being current or former public servants or people immediately connected with the HSE.  I do not get it.

The directorate by its nature comprises full-time HSE officials.  That is how it is composed.  The balance comprises persons considered by the directorate - which has the statutory responsibility to appoint the audit committee on my recommendation, as it happens - to have significant relevant experience.  Given the particular issues that arise for a body in the public sector at the time when this committee was established - it has been refreshed, and there have been some significant changes since this particular report - I believed it was of benefit to have persons who had served as Accounting Officers in the public system, hence the couple of people who were formerly Secretaries General.  However, the chair has no public sector experience and, as the Chairman has identified, there are a number of other members with very significant broadly based experience in the area of accounting, including a senior person from CRH.  It was the balance of competencies and experience and a particular ability to understand the complexities that arise in public sector accounting and the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of this committee as distinct from normal private sector accounting.  I also took the view, given the nature of some of the discussions that have to be undertaken, that it would be valuable to have a person nominated to the committee by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, which accounts for the individual who at that point was a Department of Health civil servant.

As Mr. Cregan said, whether one does it centrally by the core of the HSE or centrally by one of the CHOs, preferably the one that is the lead CHO for that organisation, the issue is to do it once and to tell the rest of the organisation.  The vast bulk of our voluntary organisations are not big enough to extend beyond one of our nine CHOs, but some very definitely are and some potentially even extend to all of them.  That is just the nature of the business.<\/p><p>It is imperative for the more important parts of governance that the key relationship, which is covered in schedule 2, is between the local community health care organisation, CHO, and the local part of the service provider to ensure there is real governance across the service, regardless of what other tasks can be done centrally.  If a large service provider has only signed in seven of eight CHOs where it happens to operate in all of them, then it has not completed the process.

If the HSE can do it, the Department can do it.  The HSE probably had the facility of saying it was withholding 20% of funding until it got this.  While we are not suggesting any cut in public funding, the Department should just think about it.  I am not suggesting it.  I am saying it seems to have worked right across the health sector, which is &euro;4 billion of public expenditure for those organisations, and that principle seemed to have a good effect.  Nobody suggested there was any cut to organisations' funding but it did put pressure on them to do it.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago, the Committee of Public Accounts dealt with issues regarding the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, Rehab and St. John of God, as well as pay in different maternity and children's hospitals and executives not being paid in line with public sector pay policy.

WAVE is one of the longest standing voluntary organisations working across Northern Ireland and has been providing services to victims and survivors of the Troubles on a cross-community basis since 1991.  While the Good Friday Agreement will be in place 20 years in 2018, the demand for services from WAVE has not diminished.  Year on year, we see a sizable number of people presenting with issues related to the 1970s and 1980s.  In the last year, we have had 650 new referrals from people between the ages of six and 90 years.<\/p> <p>  Those who hope that time and mortality will bring closure to the past do so in vain.  Many victims and survivors have struggled with the consequences of the failure to implement a comprehensive and inclusive process to deal with the past.  We look back at the Bloomfield report of 1998, the Eames-Bradley report of 2009, and Haass-O&rsquo;Sullivan report of 2013.  We are now at the Stormont House Agreement, which we believe will be the last attempt by the UK Government to address the legacy of the past.  While we accept that the priority must be getting the legal aspects of it right, and we welcome the fact there has been some suggestion of consultation, we want to raise a number of fundamental concerns.  They are based on the fact that there is a lack of information about what will be included in the legislation.  We also want to highlight to the committee the fact there has been a glaring and shameful omission from the Stormont House Agreement of any proposal to address the plight of those injured as a result of the Troubles.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the historic investigations unit, HIU, in our experience, the majority of people who come to WAVE will not be interested in, or concerned about, the legislative frameworks.  What they want is confidence in the process; clear information about how and when they can access the process; and to trust that the process will work for them.  The simple fact of passing legislation will not do that.  There should be a process that will investigate all cases.  Prosecution should be undertaken if the evidential test is met.  Individuals and families should have the right to access to as much information as possible.  We remain concerned about a number of issues in respect of this, namely, the five-year timeframe and the caseload.  Given the number of cases, we think the five-year timeframe is hopelessly unrealistic and potentially fatal to the credibility of the whole project.  With cases from the mid-1980s to 2001, there are likely to be more evidential opportunities, meaning that those cases may be more complex rather than less so.  We were very struck that the Police Ombudsman, Dr. Michael Maguire, has told individuals and families that some inquiries may take up to two decades because of pressure on resources.  He had written earlier to 130 families to say he did not know when their cases would start.<\/p> <p>  We are also concerned about the resources of &pound;150 million.  We understand that the UK Government has indicated it will make a contribution of that amount but it is not clear where the other contributions are coming from.  We are mindful that, in respect of the steak knife inquiry alone, the Chief Constable has said it will take &pound;35 million to investigate 50-odd cases.  That is 25% of the budget.  What will happen to all the other families that are left?  We are concerned that high profile, political cases will get precedence over those that have not been in the public eye beyond the day of the murder.  Those families have been left within their community.<\/p> <p>  We are concerned about the structure of the historic inquiry team.  We do not want it to be just another police investigative body.  In the past, they have failed to provide adequately for victims and survivors.  The structure and operational delivery of the HIU needs to be genuinely victim centred.  We want it to build trust and confidence.  We want the structures to be set out right at the start.  We welcome the fact that there will be reports and, we hope, information provided to families.  We hope there will be a commitment to providing that.  We are also mindful that there can be issues about retraumatisation when families get information they do not expect to hear.  While we appreciate this is not an issue for this committee, there needs to be resources to ensure that individuals and families are supported.  We also want to ensure that the HIU is not overly legalistic.  There should not be a bar in place for families who cannot afford legal input or do not want to be legally represented.  If it becomes too legalistic it may fail produce the reports that families need.  Whatever shape the process takes, we want to ensure that there is proper care and support for victims throughout.<\/p> <p>  We remain concerned about the geographical remit of the HIU.  We have concern about what will happen for people who were killed in the South or who were abducted from the North and their bodies found in the South.  We have made representations to the Governments and those in policy areas, and have received conflicting advice.  We have been told that some cases may be included depending on their proximity to the Border; that an equivalent HIU could be established in Dublin; or that the cases will go through the cold case review team from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There needs to be a process that is equal.  Families should not be treated differently.  There needs to be an investigative process in place.<\/p> <p>  There is little confidence among the victims and survivors we work with that the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, ICIR, will provide meaningful information.  There are issues around whether there is corporate responsibility and what that means.  We have seen similar difficulties in respect of the families of the disappeared.  Considering the timeframe of five years and the Independent Commission for the Disappeared, a five-year timeframe would have meant that only four of the disappeared would have been recovered.  The fact is that the work takes much longer than a five-year term.  We also believe there should be a mechanism for apology if families view that as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  If the Stormont House Agreement is implemented tomorrow, a big question arises: what process does it provide for those injured and their families?  In 2012, WAVE commissioned a study by the University of Surrey to examine the needs of the injured.  It highlighted people's financial and practical needs and their need for relief of chronic and debilitating pain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Peake"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1509023400,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>They needed to have suitable limbs to have comfort and full mobility and wheelchairs or adaptions to enable independent living.  They were prioritised over any investigative processes.   It was fourth on the list.  It was there, but fourth on the list.<\/p><p>The WAVE Injured Group has campaigned over the past five years to have a special pension in place to support those injured and their carers because many people have outlived the compensation payments they were given 30 to 40 years ago.  In some cases, those payments were quite derisory.  Comprehensive work has been undertaken by a group of injured people who continue to fight for a pension.  We have lobbied political parties over and over again and, while they all acknowledge there should be a special pension for those injured, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have been unable to agree who will receive it.  The Secretary of State has indicated that he cannot implement it.  This is a central issue for people in the context of their legacy, that is, what it means for them.  While we recognise that this does not fall within the remit of the committee or the gift of the Irish Government, we urge the committee to use whatever influence it can to move the issue on.<\/p><p>In terms of dealing comprehensively with the legacy of the past, much will depend on how victims and survivors view the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  They cannot be told once again that they will have to wait while we try again.  We also need to assist society in Northern Ireland and beyond to be more aware of the longer-term impact of bereavement, injury and traumatisation.  The lessons should be gathered from victims themselves, counsellors and psychotherapists about the human impact of the Troubles.  WAVE has a strong trauma education arm as well as a service delivery arm.  We deliver a BSc honours course in psychological trauma at Queen's University Belfast.  We also have a new postgraduate online trauma studies pathway.  It was approved last week by University College Cork.  Collating and learning the lessons of the past is essential for our future.<\/p><p>In closing, I wanted to raise the issue of the disappeared during the Troubles.  We wish to place on record our sincere thanks to the Irish Government for its continued support.  We gave evidence to this committee in December 2013.  Since then, the remains of four of the disappeared have been recovered and returned to their families for Christian burial.  The most recent, Seamus Ruddy, was buried in June.  The significance for the families involved cannot be overestimated.  There are now three outstanding disappeared cases, namely, those relating to Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac.  Columba McVeigh will be 42 years missing on Hallowe'en, 31 October.  His mother's dying wish was that he would be laid to rest between her and his father in the family grave.  We urge anyone who can help the commission to locate the bodies of the disappeared to do so.  They need to be brought home.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509023400,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address this important committee.  At a time when the Good Friday Agreement is potentially under threat from, among other things, the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, the committee's deliberations are particularly important.  CAJ is a human rights organisation.  The first duty of a human rights organisation in a post-conflict society is to try to protect the peace.  We believe that the legacy issue has direct relevance to the peace settlement and that it involves many threatening problems that remain unresolved.  In one sense, it is misleading to think of these matters as relating to the past.  The deaths and injuries during the conflict occurred in the past but the failure to properly deal with the issues arising is very much a matter of the present.  In our view, from a human rights perspective, the issue is about the deplorable maintenance of impunity for past crimes.<\/p> <p>  \"Impunity\" is the term used for a systemic failure to hold people, especially state agents, accountable for human rights violations.  It is hugely destructive of the rule of law and erodes faith in the justice system and state institutions in general.  The longer it goes on, the more it poisons contemporary society, even when it relates to crimes of the past.  A failure to hold a state to account for patterns of past human rights violations fuels the risk that they will be repeated at home and abroad when similar circumstances arise.  This is why impunity is a prime target of human rights activists throughout the world.  The failure on the part of the UK Government to properly investigate many of the deaths and maimings that occurred during the conflict, in our view, amounts to a maintenance of impunity.  Nineteen years after the Good Friday Agreement and 16 years after the landmark rulings by the European Court of Human Rights in Northern Ireland cases on the obligation to investigate deaths, there is no proper system to deal with these matters.<\/p> <p>  We had hoped that, by now, such a comprehensive system, based on the proposals in the Stormont House Agreement, would have been at least established in law.  Unfortunately, the UK Government continues to evade its responsibilities, frequently hiding behind the fact that policing and justice are matters devolved to the Northern Ireland Administration.  We need to stress that the international duty to eradicate impunity and the obligation to properly investigate the past rest with the UK Government.  A state cannot avoid its responsibilities because of its internal devolution arrangements.  For the time being, what we  have called the \"apparatus of impunity\" remains in existence.<\/p> <p>  The Stormont House Agreement of 2014 lays out the basis for a mechanism to deal with continuing impunity and to help resolve many of the continuing problems arising out of the past.  As members will know, the agreement provides for a set of new institutions to deal with the past in Northern Ireland.  These are the historical investigations unit, an independent commission on information retrieval, an oral history archive, and an implementation and reconciliation group.  It also provides recommendations for services for victims and survivors, including a mental trauma service.  The implementation of these institutions, however, requires detailed legislation.  Such legislation was scheduled to be introduced in Westminster in October 2015.  This did not happen but, in the meantime, CAJ, together with academics from Queen's University and individual experts produced a model Bill that demonstrated how the agreement could be brought into operation in a human rights compliant manner.  Copies of the model Bill and explanatory notes have been given to the committee secretariat.<\/p> <p>  After the negotiations on implementation broke down in late 2015, primarily as a result of the UK Government&rsquo;s insistence on a national security veto on information disclosed to families, we prepared a model mechanism for information redaction.  This proposed a judge-based appeal mechanism and detailed criteria for the disclosure of information.  These documents are also with the committee's secretariat.  They were passed to the two Governments in May 2016 and we published them earlier this year but there is still no indication of the UK Government's position will be on its demand for a national security veto.<\/p> <p>  The current situation is that consultation on draft legislation has repeatedly been promised by the UK Government but has so far failed to materialise.  This September, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, reflecting on the 16 years since the European Court of Human Rights gave judgment in the McKerr group of cases, which are the leading cases on this matter, noted with deep concern that the historical investigations unit and the other institutions had not been set up.  The committee stated that it is \"imperative\" that the British Government bring forward these proposals as soon as possible.  Yesterday, I heard that, in the absence of a deal between the two main parties at Stormont, the UK Government will bring forward some form of consultation before Christmas.  Having said that, we have heard it before and we do not know if it will materialise.<\/p> <p>  The Committee of Ministers also criticised the UK Government for not giving the Lord Chief Justice the resources to put forward his plan in terms of legacy inquests.  That proposal for funding was blocked personally by the then First Minister, Arlene Foster, but the UK Government has failed to bypass that blockage and the responsibility in this regard remains with it.<\/p><p> As we do every six months, we gave a report to the committee of Ministers which detailed progress in the last period, or lack of it.  It also set out an account of some of the relevant court proceedings continuing at the present time.  That report is with the committee secretariat.  Just at the end of last week, the courts announced that judicial reviews and other proceedings with a legacy element will be fast-tracked in order to minimise delays for victims.  This is to be welcomed and demonstrates that the Judiciary is prepared to do its duty.  This is in stark contrast to the executive branch of government.  In passing, I note that judgment in the \"hooded men\" case - another legacy case - will be handed down tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Belfast.  We do not know what that will be but it is an important case concerning people who were injured - or tortured in this case - during the conflict.  It is not only about deaths.<\/p><p> The current position is that the UK Government remains in violation of its duty under Articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to properly investigate deaths and serious injuries.  Impunity for state actors is maintained, the victims remain deprived of justice and faith in the rule of law and in the peace process continues to be undermined.  I hope the joint committee can bring its influence to bear and encourage the UK Government to implement the solutions to this deplorable situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509023400,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I will open the session up to questions now.

In her concluding remarks, she spoke about the bodies of the disappeared and the three which were still, unfortunately, missing.  Around that time also, the Commissioners for the Location of Victims' Remains, Mr. Murray and his colleague, addressed the committee subsequent to Ms Peake.  That was an important presentation also.  I proposed to the committee that we would invite the commissioners back.  We have to try to maintain an awareness that any shred of information out there which might be helpful in locating those people and bringing them home to their families for Christian burial is extremely important.  It is most disappointing that, after so many years, there are still three people who were abducted, killed and buried secretly who have not been located.  That is deplorable.  I hope we will be in a position to meet the commissioners so that they can get a message out to the public that if someone has information that he or she thinks might be of benefit, he or she should come forward.<\/p> <p>  Ms Peake mentioned early on in her presentation that the Police Ombudsman has indicated very clearly that he does not have the resources to carry out the investigations in a meaningful way.  Time is going by and many of the families who want to see justice and to know what happened are getting older.  With every day that passes, it is more difficult and the grief will continue to grow.  It is deplorable and reprehensible that whatever funding is necessary is not provided by government to ensure that meaningful investigations are carried out as quickly as possible.  All of us live in the real world and know it will not be easy to conclude such investigations.  Can the witnesses indicate what the committee could recommend within a realistic framework to the British Government and the Irish Government?  What amount of money is needed and what personnel resources are required?  Mr. Gormally said the fact that there has not been an Executive, with justice matters devolved to it, in Northern Ireland for almost 12 months means valuable time is being lost in the carrying out of that work.<\/p> <p>  I commend the work of the witnesses' organisations.  While it must be very difficult, it is important that families have organisations and representative groups to go to and to advocate on their behalf.  As Mr. Gormally said, their problems and these legacy issues are unresolved and they cannot remain so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#J00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509023400,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>As Ms Peake mentioned, one of our concerns in the context of resources is with what we know of how the historical investigations unit may operate.  I do not have figures for the ombudsman, but I am sure he would indicate how much he needs to resolve his cases.  While I think the figure is likely to be higher, let us take for illustrative purposes a figure of 1,000 cases to be looked at in a five-year period.  The members can correct my sums if they are inaccurate.  It would be a clear-up rate of approximately 50 cases a year from day one, which is four cases a week.  There is no investigative service in the world that is clearing up historic cases at a rate of four a week.  The illustrative figure in terms of resources is highlighted by Stakeknife, which involved 50 cases.  As the Chief Constable indicated when he was setting up what has become Operation Kenova, these would require this magic five-year period and &pound;35 million to resolve.  That is equivalent to 25% of the entire &pound;150 million, which was also to cover the independent commission on information retrieval, the archive, trends and all of that.  If we take a notional figure of 1,000 cases, that is 25% to cover approximately 5% of them.  I do not know if that is a direct illustration of the resources required to do the job comprehensively, but it gives some indication of the scale of what is involved.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, WAVE's issue is that we do not want promises being made to victims and survivors which simply cannot be met.  We cannot keep doing this.  We have been doing it for years.  As Deputy Brendan Smith rightly pointed out, we were here in 2013 and again in 2015.  If one goes back over the record, I bet the presentations we made were not a lot different.  We could have made the same presentation in 2003.  That is a fundamental issue.  This will be the last go at it, I think, and, somehow, we have to get it right.  We must ensure that promises are not made to victims that we know cannot be delivered on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dennis Godfrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1509023400,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>I commend the witnesses on their presentations and take this opportunity, having had first-hand experience - as I indicated at the previous meeting - of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, to compliment them on the work they have done.  I reiterate Deputy Brendan Smith's call to anybody out there with additional information, particularly as I have experienced, at first hand, the sensitivity with which the commission has dealt with some of the more recent locations.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gormally stated that the UK is in violation of its responsibility, which is a strong statement and one with which I obviously concur.  Does he care to comment on the impact these delays on legacy issues may be having on the fragile peace process?  I ask that question in the context, again, of a visit we had in Belfast where the older generation involved in the conflict saw no reason to encourage the younger generations to have faith either in the delivery of peace money down to where it needs to go or in the fact that legacy issues will be dealt with.  We were seen to be at a stalemate.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to Brexit.  While we all recognise that the British Government has a responsibility to the Good Friday Agreement, is it important that, as part of its withdrawal from the EU, Britain should be encouraged or made to ring-fence substantial funding to deal with the legacy issues?  Regardless of Brexit, it might still be in possible violation of its responsibility to ring-fence funds to build on the peace process.<\/p><p>In addition, there is the question of ensuring that Westminster continues to subscribe to the various programmes that are necessary for the bedding down of the peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#J00500","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509023400,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>The failure to deal with legacy issues certainly is a threat to the peace process.  Consider, for example, a young man living in a deprived area of the North - we will say he is from a republican background - who is being told that we have had a peace process and everything is different now and that he is living in a society that is rights-based and fair to all.  However, that young fellow can see for himself what is happening in regard to legacy issues and that the basic responsibilities of the state in the context of dealing with murders and maimings are not being carried out.  There may be an argument that this is difficult stuff and, of course, that is true at one level.  However, what we must look at here is Deputy Brenda Smith's question about resources and what is being done in that regard.  The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland has put forward a plan to deal with all legacy inquests within five years, which he will do as long as he is given the money.  As I said earlier, that proposal was blocked by the First Minister, Arlene Foster, but what is the big deal about the British Government making that money available?  It is not difficult politically to support the Lord Chief Justice - the chief judge in the jurisdiction - to do his job.  It is not a political issue that requires detailed consensus among and back-up from the various institutions.  At that kind of level, we can see that the will is lacking to do a deal.  Going back to our young man, where is the fair society he was promised?  The danger is that people like him will be told by demagogues and ideologues that nothing has changed, the Brits are just the same as they ever were and it is time to take up the gun again.  That is the reality of what people are being told.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is another example of the same type of problem.  The Deputy might not want me to go on too long about Brexit but its impact is such that the whole delicate constitutional arrangement - the east-west and North-South structures that were put together with great ingenuity in 1998 - have just been knocked over by the proposal to withdraw from the European Union.  It may be a question of putting Humpty Dumpty back together again if Brexit goes ahead, but the damage to the peace process will have been done.  What people are being told, namely, that they have a future on this island, is undermined by the actions of a Government that does not really seem to care about this stuff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509023400,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>On the legacy issue, that is something we all hoped would have been resolved many years ago.  It is unfair that it has rolled on for so long.  At a previous meeting of the committee, witnesses from another delegation, in discussing the legacy issue, stated clearly that their family members, people who had seen big adjustments in their lifetime, were dying before any of these matters had been resolved.  In some cases, young people are fighting on behalf of grandparents who died perhaps 30 or 40 years ago.  We hope legacy issues will be at the heart of the ongoing talks and that there will be a positive outcome.  Both Governments, as well as the parties in the North, have a part to play in this.  A positive outcome would help to resolve many of the ongoing issues and allow society to move on.  There will always be people within society who find it hard to move on if they do not have some form of justice for their loved ones, whether those loved ones were injured in the conflict or lost their lives.<\/p> <p>  Ms Peake referred to the ongoing issue of the disappeared.  I take this opportunity to call on anybody who has any information at all to come forward as a matter of urgency in order to get those issues resolved and allow families to bury their loved ones with dignity and respect.  That call should go out from this room today.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gormally noted that the British Government has said on many occasions that it intends to consult victims on these matters.  Have the delegates met with representatives of the British Government lately and, if so, what response have they had to the points they raised?  Have they met representatives of the Irish Government and, if so, would they say the latter are putting pressure on the British Government, as everybody needs to do, to encourage it to engage?  I agree entirely that there is money there within the system, but, as Mr. Gormally observed, the Lord Chief Justice is saying that funding is needed.  I was in court last Friday in Belfast where I spoke to people who have lost loved ones.  The decision to fast-track some of those cases is very welcome, but five years might still be too long in certain instances.  However, at least we have a date set for action and a timeline for completion.  Will the delegates indicate whether they have had any recent engagement with the two Governments and, if so, what has come out of those engagements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Maskey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509023400,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>Some people involved in our group have had conversations with officials in recent days, where the indication was that consultation is probably going to go ahead.

If there is no agreement, it will be brought forward in any event.  However, we have been told that kind of thing by officials before, so it should not be taken as gospel.  It has been a while since we talked to the Secretary of State about these matters, although it was not terribly valuable even when we did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509023400,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>We met the Secretary of State in July when his mind was, as members can imagine, on the broader politics.  This is where the whole thing tends to get run into the ground.  There is an attitude of, \"If they won't do it at the minute, then I can't do it.\"  That causes a difficulty.<\/p> <p>  One issue to which Ms Peake referred that is doable and resolvable, because we are talking about a finite number of people, concerns provision for those severely injured during the conflict.  I refer to the very top category of injuries, which would include bilateral amputees, paraplegics, the blind and so on.  We have one such young man of 42 but most of these people are in their 60s, 70s and 80s.  Most were unable to build up an occupational pension and now fund themselves by living on benefits.  One such person is Jennifer, who was 21 when she lost both her legs in a no-warning bomb attack.  Peter was 26 when, in a case of mistaken identity, he was shot by a loyalist gang.  The configuration of his flat meant that the ambulance crew could not get him down on a stretcher and had instead to take him out in a body bag.  As he came out, his father arrived at the building, assumed his son was dead and had a heart attack and died at the scene.  Margaret was rendered instantly blind when the bomb which detonated outside her office blew the window panes in on top of her.  She has spent years undergoing very painful reconstructive surgery to have glass removed from her mouth.  If I recall correctly, that incident occurred in 1985 and, even today, glass that was embedded in the deep muscle tissue still sometimes comes through her skin.  Her husband occasionally has to warn her that she needs to change her clothes before visitors arrive because her thighs and arms are pockmarked with blood.  These are the people we at WAVE are representing.  Paul, who is our youngest victim, was 21 when a loyalist gang entered his home to wait for his next door neighbour to return.  When the neighbour did not show up, the gang members emptied a machine gun magazine into Paul.  He was left having to use a wheelchair and, this year, he lost a kidney as a direct consequence of his injuries.  His suffering is ongoing.<\/p> <p>  These people are not asking for very much.  The quantum would be some &euro;3 million per year, which is not a huge amount of money.  We have lobbied and met all the parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and Traditional Unionist Voice, on more than one occasion, and they are always good meetings.  In fact, it is essentially the same meeting each time because everybody agrees that these people deserve something.<\/p><p> Virtually everywhere in the world where conflict has been resolved, the work has been done by these guys, mostly commissioned through WAVE and Queen's University.  We have done research in Colombia and Spain.  We keep running into the issue of eligibility.  They reckon of the 500 there are ten, six loyalists and four republicans, who it could be said were injured by their own hand, in other words, by a premature bomb explosion or whatever.  Therein lies the impasse.  Sinn F&eacute;in takes the position that everyone should have access to this because it is a matter of need.  The DUP, unionists generally and the Government say that people injured by their own hand will not get it.  That is where we are and have been.  The 490 others, Paul, Peter, Margaret, Jennifer, Alec, Mark and various others, have to wait.<\/p><p> WAVE is saying that it would be unfair to put it on victims to be the arbiters of who should get this.  They say they need it.  They are not saying who should not get it, they are saying they should.  If there is an argument and discussion about others, that is not for them to have, that is a political, moral argument.  We are arguing, although it is outside the remit of this committee, that pressure should be put on.  Fundamentally, this is a legacy issue.<\/p><p> The processing of a pension would be devolved of course but this is essentially a legacy issue.  We have argued with the Secretary of State that at the end of the day the British Government has overarching responsibility for legacy.  If the local administration cannot agree on it then it has to be done effectively at Westminster.  We are saying that the people who have been injured through no fault of their own should get it tomorrow.  If there is an issue there must be a way of getting process, whether that is a review process to consider cases in the round, and we are talking about a relatively small number.  Since the group was set up in 2011, four have died.  These are people who were injured during the 1970s and 1980s.  Their average age would be in the 60s, some are in their 70s, although Paul is 42.  We get a lot of sympathy but we would like if any influence can be brought to bear in any quarter to see some resolution for these people because they are all getting older.  As people get older with those kinds of injuries, the pain is compounded each year and mobility becomes more difficult.  All they want is a bit of dignity as they get older, not a huge sum of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017102600002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dennis Godfrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509023400,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>Thank you for the presentation.  I am just interested in the compensation and pension aspect.  The people who are severely injured or disabled rely on state benefits.  The younger ones will be affected by the changeover from disability living allowance to the personal independence plan.  There have been problems around that.  Any compensation with pensions would have to be stand-alone because I am sure they find it difficult to survive on the benefits they already receive.  It would have to be ensured that anything extra they get is separate from, and would not impact on, the benefits they already get.  The state pension in Britain and in the North is among the meanest in the developed world.  It is dreadful.  This is speculation that people would, I hope, eventually be entitled to some sort of recompense for the horrific injuries that many have suffered.  The disability living allowance stuff will not affect the over 65s but there are younger people it might affect.  Is WAVE getting any feedback from the changeover because of the welfare cuts?  They are cuts not reform or anything near it.  Are any victims or people who were injured during the conflict affected by the changes occurring?

We are seeing ongoing problems for people needing sufficient evidence and people who have never tapped into this, who are living with debilitating injuries, coming before the system and struggling with it.  Some people have not even confided with their general practitioner, GP, what happened to them.  That has been a particular problem.  The records do not exist.  There is a huge issue.  We not only had disability discrimination through the 70s and 80s.  There was conflict discrimination.  People were not able to go back into work.

I was in a house recently where the children were still locked upstairs at night with a metal gate.  Those children are living in a fortified house 19 years after the Good Friday Agreement came into place but the parent is still afraid.  There is no doubt the impact on parents affects children.  We saw children last year from the age of five and this year from the age of six.  That is very young for children to be presenting at a trauma centre and requiring support.  Senator Black's point is well made in that regard.<\/p><p> I attended consultations families had with Sir Kenneth Bloomfield in 1998 and then we come forward then to the Bradley-Eames group.

They need to get it right and to do it as soon as possible.  They should not expect us to wait.  It is very unfair.  Mr. Gormally made the point that we are blighting the next generation and we are blighting the peace process.  It has to be done.  It is not going to go away.  If members think time and mortality will sort it out that will not happen because we are just passing it to the next generation.  Mr. Maskey spoke about his grandchildren.  The families of the disappeared are a good example.  I used to deal a lot with the mothers but there is only one mother of the disappeared left because, sadly, the rest have died.  We are now dealing with the siblings and they have said if the issue is not addressed in their lifetimes, it will be passed to their nephews and nieces to deal with.  Is it right that we should ask nephews and nieces or grandchildren to deal with what happened?  It should be dealt with now.

If that is a legal question, for example, if people were killed lawfully, they were killed lawfully.  What one needs is a proper investigation that demonstrates whether or not that is the case.  That has got nothing to do with prejudging the status of victims.  Unfortunately, I do think there is a tendency to conflate people who were lawfully killed with those who were killed by state actors.  Sometimes it is said that only 10% of people were directly killed by state actors but if one takes collusion into account one is talking about very different figures.  The term \"collusion\" is no longer a propaganda term, it is a fact without any doubt.  What one has is a political view of what constitutes a victim holding up services and justice for all victims.  The pensions for the injured is the most dramatic and disgraceful example of that.  On foot of political disagreements about the definition of \"victim\", nobody is getting anything.

I am an architect and an assistant professor at the UCD school of architecture, planning and environmental policy.  My area of expertise is construction regulation, procurement and the operation of the construction industry in Ireland.  I have direct involvement and experience in national and EU systems for regulating qualifications and assessing competence.  The purpose of today's session is pre-legislative scrutiny.  This provides us with an opportunity for public analysis and feedback on draft legislation.  In preparation for this session, I have reviewed the draft construction industry register Bill and consulted widely on the technical workings and implications of this policy initiative.<\/p> <p>  In summary, a sustainable and robust construction industry needs an effective building control system, an efficient construction sector, a flexible labour market and a fighting fund for remedying defects.  No single one of these parts can be looked at in isolation.  The regulation of certain professions, trades, builders and developers is necessary in the interests of public safety, environmental protection and consumers.  Restrictions on activities must be justifiable and proportionate.  Targeted robust regulation is required in specific areas of high risk because the legacy of defective and dangerous buildings cannot be repeated.<\/p> <p>  There are shortcomings in the proposed general scheme of this Bill, which relates to the Irish construction industry register, or CIRI.  There are inadequate consumer protections, particularly for home buyers.  There is no mechanism for consumer redress to repair defects.  There are inherent conflicts of interest.  CIRI is not independent.  The absence of independent regulatory oversight of CIRI is not in accordance with best practice.  Restrictions on the activities of builders and trades are not in compliance with EU law.  In certain respects, this legislation duplicates or is incompatible with the activities of other State agencies and organisations.  There is inadequate stakeholder consultation, evaluation of alternatives and regulatory impact analysis.  There is no cost-benefit analysis or evaluation of the administrative and technical capacity required to deliver CIRI.  There has been no assessment of the impact on competitiveness in the construction industry, particularly with regard to restrictions on labour supply.<\/p> <p>  What is the State's role here?  Why is regulation necessary?  When it comes to buildings, the role of the State is primarily protection of life.  It seeks to ensure buildings are safe and sustainable.  This includes fire safety, ventilation, soundproofing and structural integrity, as well as protection from falls, radiation contamination, carbon monoxide and other dangers to the health of occupants.  Other risks include environmental damage, energy inefficiency, sewage contamination and dangerous materials.  A secondary requirement is protection of property to protect consumers who buy a product, in effect.  Not all consumers need the same level of protection.  Home buyers are particularly vulnerable.  For the public, buildings must be safe to use and must not be damaging to their health.  For the State, buildings must be energy efficient and must not cause damage to the environment.  The priority for the home buyer is fixing the problem.  CIRI does not provide a mechanism or a fund to repair defects.<\/p> <p>  How many builders will be affected by this?  There are 100,000 construction companies, self-employed subcontractors and tradespersons in this sector.  According to a survey conducted by DKM and SOLAS, approximately 70% of construction firms are self-employed with no employees and direct employment is expected to increase to approximately 213,000 by 2020.  On this basis, it is possible that approximately 150,000 companies and individuals will have to be assessed for competence and will have to register in order to work.  CIRI currently has approximately 800 members.  The cost of putting this in place, and the delays associated with that, have not been calculated.  What is needed?  Registration for builders was flagged by the Department in 2012 in a document on its future focus of policy.  It emphasised that registration should be in keeping with competition law, include strong quality assurance checks, provide strong consumer protection, have the cover of insurance and not add excessively to the cost of housing.  These five policy objectives have not been addressed in the CIRI legislation.<\/p> <p>  I recommend there should be a future-proofed system that is aligned with other policy objectives that include construction growth and efficiency, better procurement and insurance, developments in the State building control structures, supports for training and skills and tax compliance.  There should be an independent flexible and scalable registration system that is appropriate to risk and complies with EU legislation.  Perhaps such a system could be similar to the CORU model for the regulation of health professionals.  The system should not create barriers to trade or have an impact on construction competitiveness or SME costs.  It should be possible for it to be rolled out strategically without causing delays and blockages in the construction sector.  Independent regulatory oversight and enforcement of construction is essential to ensure public safety and environmental protection.  There should be consumer-focused systems of protection and redress, with a single point of contact for complaints and remediation across the construction sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to speak on the general scheme of the proposed Irish construction industry register Bill.  I am a barrister in the final year of my PhD research on legal remedies and redress for defective housing.  In my previous submissions to this committee, I set out my concerns regarding the construction regulation system in Ireland.  I have reviewed the general scheme of this Bill.  I thought it would be beneficial to the committee for me to examine how the proposed scheme fits in with the existing legal and regulatory context for construction regulation in Ireland, and specifically whether it achieves the objective of consumer protection.<\/p> <p>  I wish to highlight four particular issues in my opening statement, namely, consumer protection, the best way to regulate, public accountability and conflicts of interest, as well as effective regulation and State involvement.  On the question of whether CIRI will protect consumers, I emphasise that consumer protection in construction regulation requires good-quality housing to be built, with accessible remedies for poor-quality housing.  The proposed Bill provides no remedies for consumers.  It may be presented as part of a package of reforms, but those reforms do not address the most significant issues facing consumers, including poor legal remedies, the lack of cost-effective access to dispute resolution procedures and the lack of mandatory defects insurance to cover the legal liability of insolvent builders, which could at least provide an after-the-event pathway to a remedy for the home owner.  A private registration system might be thought satisfactory in a country with greater State involvement in the construction process generally and with better legal remedies for defects but it could have highly negative consequences in Ireland, where the regulatory system and the legal regime for remedies are both inadequate from the perspective of consumer protection.<\/p><p>An example would be a consumer dealing with defects in a home.  A home owner dealing with defects may make a complaint to the CIRI admissions and registration board, and the complaint may result in disciplinary action or prosecution against the builder, which will not fix the defects.  To obtain compensation to fix the defects, the consumer will still have to pursue a long and expensive remedy through legal proceedings.  If the defect is a breach of the building regulations, that person can also complain to the local building control authority and possibly also the registration bodies of any professionals involved in the works, none of which is obliged to act or award compensation in order that another builder can do the work.  Only the building control authority can order the builder to put the work right, and then only realistically during the construction stage.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>How should builders be regulated?  The scheme will result in a private system to regulate builders and a separate public system to regulate what they build.  It is a missed opportunity to further develop the national building control management infrastructure as a central regulatory tool for regulation of both building and builders.  This will result in significant information gaps, and for example, only the local building control authority will know of a registered CIRI member&rsquo;s record on compliance with the building regulations.  This information could be captured on the building control management system and then used by the registration and licensing system for builders if the two systems were operated under a common framework.  An independent regulator with responsibility for the building control management system could use the system as a regulatory tool to monitor persons and entities involved with construction using information submitted relating to projects and any inspection and enforcement information supplied by building control authority authorised officers in respect of construction works.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>An example is a hypothetical builder with a history of poor compliance with the building regulations.  Information I have obtained from building control authorities indicates that formal enforcement powers are seldom used under the building control Acts.  A builder with a pattern of non-compliance in construction works may have negotiated on more than one occasion to avoid formal enforcement.  Under the CIRI model, a person&rsquo;s registration will not be affected by these non-compliances unless that person is convicted under the Act; even then, CIRI may only discover the conviction if the member discloses it.<br\/><br\/>The proposed system will act as a gateway to being able to work for large numbers of people and would be a significant transfer of power from the State to a private entity.  Independence cannot be ensured simply through the composition of the CIRI boards<b><i>. <\/i><\/b>The system will not be overseen by a regulator, as are the RECI and RGI systems for electricians and gas installers, respectively.  These functions have been specifically delegated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and the commission monitors the performance of these schemes, as well as taking enforcement action where electrical or gas works are carried out illegally.  A leading Irish expert on the delegation of State powers to the private sector has observed that where similar delegations have occurred in the United States, the private delegates are exempt from requirements that apply to the Government and State agencies, such as disclosure requirements, oversight structures, conflict of interest and reporting requirements and ethical obligations.  There is no mention in this Bill of the Freedom of Information Act, the Ethics in Public Office Act or whether CIRI will be subject to the Ombudsman Acts.  There are no requirements on any committee or board members of CIRI to disclose their own financial interests.  There are a number of examples of other Irish regulatory bodies where such information is available, and for good reason; this Bill entrusts a significant amount of power to a private entity over who can work and what work they can do.  These norms of regulatory governance are not reflected in the Bill.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Finally, I refer to effective regulation of construction, investment and State involvement<b>.<\/b>As part of my PhD I have researched systems of construction regulation in other countries.  The consistent feature of effective and robust regimes is that they are properly resourced, independent of the regulated industry, with sufficient profile and credibility in the sector to influence compliance.  My research suggests that part of the reason for the widespread defects in our housing stock is that, at least in recent years, there has not been a credible threat of enforcement of the building regulations.  There are powers of enforcement in this Bill but building control authorities also have formal enforcement powers that are seldom used.  The evidence of the number of defects in Irish houses and apartments points to a widespread and systematic disregard of the building regulations.  Why would people comply when it is cheaper not to comply and there is little chance of being caught and little chance that one will be prosecuted or even have to pay to fix the defects if caught?<br\/><br\/>I have previously told this committee of my concern that the system of mandatory inspection and certification set up in 2014 would be seen to be doing the heavy lifting of regulation and that the public system would suffer unless it was resourced and supported.  Investment in building control and in the building control management project is very small by comparison with the value of the construction sector.  If regulation of builders is entrusted to the private sector, the public system will be undermined and we will miss an opportunity to develop a robust system using the building control management system as a key tool.<br\/><br\/>There are successful examples worldwide of the private actors having a role in construction regulation, and it can work well.  Our context is different.  We have extensive evidence of breaches of building regulations, poor legal remedies, expensive and complex procedures for dispute resolution and a lack of mandatory defects insurance.  My research and analysis of the particular experience of Ireland in recent years suggests that the State should be investing in strengthening and supporting the regulatory system instead of outsourcing a key pillar of that system to a private representative body for the construction industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I thank the two witnesses here today and it was a good move on the part of this committee to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is something we were not initially considering but after some debate it was decided it would happen by the committee.  It was the right thing to do.  The witnesses have raised a number of interesting and key points but we need to tease them out further.  Anybody partaking in this debate, whether from the construction industry or on this committee, recognises we need a sustainable and robust construction industry that is effective in terms of building control.  It should be an efficient sector that is also flexible in respect of the labour market and for the needs of this economy, particularly with respect to housing, construction, development of industry and all that goes with it.  It is something we are all in favour of and it is really important.  We are starting on the premise that it is what we want and need or at least it is what I believe we need.<\/p> <p>  Ms Hegarty has raised a number of matters but we need a bit more meat on them.  She spoke about inadequate consumer protection, particularly for home buyers, with no mechanism for consumer redress.  We need to tease that out.

I can see how people would see that and it is important not only that it be transparent but that the public is assured on this issue.  We must also note what Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn stated, in that the building control authorities have failed for years.

Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn spoke about her own experience and research in the area and we must acknowledge that building control authorities have failed.  We need to get behind the reason they failed.

We will divide the answers between us.  A point was made about consumer protection and redress and another was made about building control authorities and why enforcement by such authorities is perceived to have failed.  Senator Boyhan raised a question about who would control the system and run it efficiently, which Ms Hegarty will deal with, and I was asked to deal with a question about freedom of information and the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to deal with the first point in respect of inadequate consumer protection and redress.  This is along the lines of what I addressed the committee about when I was before it in April.  There are a number of significant legal hurdles for ordinary homeowners.  They also affect commercial individuals, but I will particularly address the example of someone who owns his or her home and who has either bought it from new or had works carried out on it.  If there are defects in that home, the remedies available to that person are very poor.  They are very poor at common law under the law of contract if the person in question is not the first buyer.<\/p> <p>  When I spoke to the committee on the last occasion I also raised the fact that our systems of dispute resolution, arbitration and litigation are very lengthy, time consuming and expensive.  It is very difficult for consumers to navigate.  Senator Boyhan has returned.  I am dealing with his first point about inadequate consumer protection and redress.  I have looked at a number of cases before the Irish courts in which it has been very apparent that consumers have spent years trying to pursue remedies against multiple defendants at considerable cost to themselves.  Waiting to see if they can get a remedy and for somebody to fix significant problems with their homes can cause considerable personal stress.  I am not the first person to call for law reform.  I mapped out the law reforms which I believe should be undertaken in the area of legal remedies in the submission which I made to the committee in April.  In my view, we need to introduce primary legislation to deal with the problem of remedy in contract not being available to subsequent purchasers.<\/p><p>I wrote \"revisit that\" but I also made various points at the time about a consumer friendly system of dispute resolution.  <\/p><p> On the point made about the freedom of information, ethics in public office and conflicts of interest, other Irish State bodies are subject to a fairly wide number of different types of regulation in terms of their behaviour, financial interest and regulation of lobbying.  One can peruse the websites and annual reports of other public bodies, such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, and find out the financial interests of the various members of the committees and boards who are involved in those bodies.  That is part of the accountability model that is used for those types of bodies that have a very important regulatory role.  A body that has the power to regulate a sector and say which people can work in it and under what conditions must be subject to very rigorous standards of accountability.  If there is a means to find out whether a person had a financial interest in a matter that is a very serious matter.  That is why we regulate, under the Ethics in Public Office Act, for disclosures of interest that must be made by people in certain positions of employment or by certain public bodies.<\/p><p> The Freedom of Information Act is another example.  The reason that I know that the formal enforcement powers of the Building Control Acts are very seldom used is based on the fairly scant information available on that aspect in the annual reports produced by local authorities.  When I submitted freedom of information requests to local authorities that is when I made the  discovery.  I succeeded because I specifically said, \"May I have a copy of the register for the last five years of the number of enforcement notices issued under the Building Control Acts and the number of convictions that have been secured?\"  This matter is of fundamental importance for this Bill because of one of the matters that an applicant must demonstrate when he or she submits an application to the CIRI board.  He or she must declare that he or she has no convictions under the Building Control Acts.  When one cross-refers the matter to the exercise of those powers by building control authorities we find that the formal enforcement powers are virtually never used.  Out of all of the building control authorities that I spoke to or contacted I did not find a single one to confirm that there had been an any convictions under the Act in the last five years.  Many of them have not issued a single enforcement notice under the Acts.  Senator Boyhan was right to ask whether this aspect tells us our building control system is fit for purpose.  I am not in any sense criticising building control authorities.  I simply wish to make the point that this is part of the really essential context that we must consider when examining the effect of this Bill.  In my view this aspect raises questions about resourcing and support for the work of building control authorities, which again is a point I made when I addressed the committee in April.  I will now hand over to Ms Hegarty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1065,"content":"<p>I will first deal with the question on the restrictions imposed on the activities of builders.  Our system of building control works on the principle of regulating people in the expectation that the people will quality control the building rather than quality controlling the building and letting people build.  When one goes down the route of regulating the building then the State could decide how to do so.  It is a national matter for Ireland to decide how to regulate and inspect buildings.<\/p> <p>  When one goes down the route of regulating the people involved there is a European dimension that comes under the remit of the services directive.  The services directive imposes quite strong limitations on allowing member states to restrict both the freedom of movement and the freedom of establishment.  There is quite a high bar that one must reach.  We have it for electricians, gas installers and crane operators due to the public safety element of their services.  The State must demonstrate that it is proportionate and justifiable if it wishes to regulate, which is quite a high bar as found by the European Court of Justice, ECJ.<\/p> <p>  We already have structures to regulate some construction professionals - the non-craft through SOLAS.  I have spoken to SOLAS about how the system operates and I am also familiar with how it works for the professions.  If it were to operate for certain building operatives it would first need to cross the bar of demonstrating that it is necessary and there was a public interest and a public safety aspect.  It would only be allowed to regulate that aspect.  It would need to determine on a European basis the standard of competence to be assessed.  It needs to set up structures in order to both assess people and be recognised as a clearing house for equivalence across Europe.  The structures to do so are quite complex and onerous.  They would need quite a lot of resourcing in order to be open, transparent and even-handed.  In any system that is credible there will be certain people who will not meet the standard of competence.  The system must be designed around the people who are disappointed when they make an application because they will then need a right of appeal and may go to court.  Also, the system needs to be consistent over many years and ensure that everybody is handled in the same way.<\/p> <p>  Qualifications in construction are very complex.  Unlike for a doctor, engineer or an architect there is no national standard agreed across Europe for those professions.  It would be a case that Ireland would have to determine what that standard is,  demonstrate that it is necessary for public safety reasons, establish the standard and then regulate anybody from Europe who chose to work here through assessing their prior work and qualifications to that standard.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of conflicts of interest, there are inherent conflicts of interest when an organisation performs the two unaligned functions of representing builders or employers and being involved in making representations or lobbing, and also has a consumer focus.  If an organisation has to carry out the two functions then at the very least one would expect to see quite a strong Chinese wall down the middle of the organisation.  That is not the way that CIRI is structured.  CIRI is structured to have a board with some independent members.  All of the wraparound to administer that, in terms of the public faith and the person who picks up the phone, it is the same phone number that the consumer must dial to complain about a building as a builder who seeks support from the organisation following a complaint.  There no clarity about the purpose.  There is plenty of potential risk in terms of how the system would operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>I will take questions from Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor and I will then come back to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#L00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>Apologies for the disruption caused by the adjournment earlier.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask a range of different questions.  We have discussed with the witnesses and others before today the whole issue of consumer protection element of building regulations and standards, and whether it is latent defects insurance or some other system can provide greater protection.  When we put that idea to the Department at an earlier stage of pre-legislative scrutiny one of the arguments that the officials made was that there is a range of different pieces that will improve the building regulations architecture and they have to do them piece by piece.  Therefore, they argued that this is one piece in a bigger picture.  I would like to here how the witnesses will respond to that argument.  Would the witnesses prefer to see the consumer protection bit in place first?  Would they prefer if the consumer protection and the industry register were located in the same place such as in the form of a building standards and consumer protection agency or some such body?  <\/p> <p>  Clearly, many of us have raised this question.  We will meet the CIF and others later today.  I wish to forewarn them, since they are in the background listening, that we will raise the issue of independence.  When we raised the issue with the Department the officials replied that this is the way this is done in other aspects of industry such as the Royal Institute of the Architects in Ireland and others and they operate a similar kind of mode.  In fact, the officials in the Department went so far as saying that other countries are looking to Ireland and considering this model to see if this is the way they should go.  How does the CIRI register, as constituted in the heads of a Bill, compare with the system that operates in the sphere of architecture?  Are the systems comparable?  I believe that there are differences between the two representative bodies in terms of who they represent and their roles and functions. <\/p> <p>  In terms of scale, there is a much smaller number of architects or consultants than workers in the construction industry.  It is all very well to say that we will have a register.  Given the scale, and the witnesses mentioned there could possibly be up to 250,000 on the register, how long would this process take?  How big an enterprise is this when compared with some of the other registers that exist for other professions?<\/p> <p>  I keep asking people what has been learned from the voluntary register as it has existed for a period.  Have the witnesses had any interaction with the process?  Can they indicate whether the process has changed things?  Have the witnesses sought information from the voluntary register in terms of some of the issues they have raised such as transparency and accountability?<\/p><p>Have they had to make freedom of information, FOI, requests for information that may have been refused?  Can they give us an indication as to whether they have direct experience in this regard?  Do they know others who have engaged with the voluntary register and, if so, has it made a difference?<\/p><p> Notwithstanding their very clear concerns about the location of the register within the Construction Industry Federation, the board membership was an issue of considerable debate previously in that the question whether or not it should have a majority of ministerial or industry appointees arose.  Before we get to the Chinese walls argument, will the witnesses give us their views of the board structure and membership as currently outlined?  Do they think any changes could be made to it at least to improve the legislation?  Regarding the Chinese walls, is Ms Hegarty suggesting that her preferred option is that this is taken out and put in some independent body?  If that is not on the table from the Government's point of view, what kinds of changes would she like to see to what is on the table at present in terms of creating greater Chinese walls so it is not just a matter of a different telephone number or a different office?  What is best practice in this regard?<\/p><p> Do the witnesses have any information about what other jurisdictions are doing or have been doing in this area of regulation of the industry?  Would they like to suggest any models of best practice?  They may wish to come back to us on some of these issues in writing rather than orally.  The point they made about conflicts of interest was very well made.  For the sake of clarity, can they give us a number of notional examples of the conflicts of interest they would be concerned about that could arise from the Bill as it currently stands?<\/p><p> My last point concerns the point Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn made about enforcement and legal action.  That only refers to enforcement action and legal action taken by registered authorities within the State.  What about, for example, enforcement actions, legal actions or indeed convictions taken against developers, builders or contracts who reside outside the State and are tendering for work?  We know this is becoming increasingly common in commercial and residential construction, and that is clearly a gap in the Bill.  How can we try to close this gap down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#L00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin has made some of the points I wanted to make.  The biggest issue here is that the system does not have a regulator.  I am a firm believer that every public body now needs a regulator because there is so much unaccountability.  Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn mentioned looking to the local authorities for figures on enforcement, complaints and convictions.  A builder wanting to build so many houses must, naturally enough, put a bond in place, which goes through the local authority.  If, by misfortune, the housing goes into liquidation and the builder cannot afford to continue building the houses, who is accountable for the bond?  At this stage 30 of 80 houses could be built and people could have bought them and be living in them.  Driving into the estate, one might see unfinished lights, paths and roads.  These people could have bought the houses for &euro;400,000 each, and now they might cost &euro;200,000.  Who is accountable for that?  These are people's lives we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  We absolutely need regulation, but there is no accountability.  Five years after the situation I have outlined, if one goes back to the local authority and the bond is not there, the local authority will have to see whether it can finish the footpaths, the lights and the roads because they will be unsafe.  We have a duty of care to people who have bought homes in such circumstances.  When they buy these homes, there should be a guarantee from a regulator that the relevant works will be done.  This is a major issue.  I am a firm believer in the construction industry and in ensuring local employment and so on, but one could hear that the builder has gone ten miles down the road and started another estate without finishing the first one.  One is left thinking, where is the regulator, and who is implementing or allowing this?  Home-owners need bonds because, for them, the guarantee of knowing they have bonds is crucial.<\/p> <p>  Overall, in the long term, we hope many more houses will be built in the next few years between local authorities and private providers, and that is great.  However, we need proper regulations, everything must be sorted and everyone must be accountable in this, and this is not the case at present.  I have much the same reservations the witnesses have about certain issues they have raised.  They are right to highlight them, and we need answers.  Bonds are definitely a massive issue in respect of which there is no accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#M00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I now come back to Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn and Ms Hegarty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#M00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I will take one of the first questions asked about a similar model.  The CIRI Bill has been drafted on the basis of the Building Control Act 2007.  I do not feel this is appropriate.  Professionals are there to give advice, so if they give bad advice, the purpose is to sanction them in order that they do not give bad advice in the future.  Builders build a product, a building, so a complaints process that looks at their professional performance, misconduct and consumer service is not really appropriate because the complainant wants the house, the product, fixed.  A more appropriate model might be what happens in the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland, RECI, which is how the electricians are regulated.  If one makes a complaint to RECI, one receives receipt of one's complaint within a day and RECI sends an independent inspector out to look at the electrical installation within seven days.  This is what home-owners want.  They do not necessarily want their complaints to be put to a complaints committee for an investigation that will drag on for several months, at the end of which perhaps someone will be sanctioned.  The complainant still has the problem with the building that will not be fixed.  What complainants want is perhaps similar to what happens under RECI.  I do not think the model for professional bodies is appropriate to use for builders.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how these bodies operate, in preparation for this meeting, I sought records from the bodies for architects, surveyors and engineers and from CIRI.  Engineers Ireland does not have a statutory register and does not publish any data regarding sanction of its members, so these were not available.  I got some information from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, but it is clear that a very small number of actions get to the point of enforcement or any public sanction.  It is also clear that most of the complaints are mediated within the organisation before going to the independent board for consideration, which demonstrates somewhat of a conflict of interest.  A very small percentage of the reports get to the independent board, and most of them are negotiated or mediated, so it is good practice to have a sliding scale as to how one deals with complaints.  However, the sliding scale should be within the independent body, not within the organisation, because there are again conflicts there regarding which ones are pursued and which ones are not and perhaps how people are advised at an early stage on some of that.  As a model, using a professional is not the same.  I sought advice from CIRI on the number of people admitted and sanctioned over the past three or four years since it was established but that has not been provided to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>Did CIRI say why it could not give Ms Hegarty that information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#M00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>No.<\/p> <p>  Finally, to return to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about this being one piece of a bigger picture, what people expect from this and what is in the Bill are perhaps two different things.  There are many different expectations.  I think there are people who expect this to sort out problems with non-compliance regarding tax, people who expect it to streamline the public procurement system, people who expect it to level the playing pitch for compliant contractors, and people who expect it to be a consumer body.  In various aspects of the document, one can see there is not really an alignment as to what the main focus of this should be.  However, if one backtracks into the policy decisions of Government over recent years, going back quite a way into Strengthening the Building Control System, Report of the Pyrite Panel, the National Competitiveness Council reports and Construction 2020, the core element of registration of builders in all these documents is about consumer protection.  The policy behind much of this was about not having another Priory Hall and not having more pyrite problems, but along the way it has lost that focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Hegarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for those questions.  I will go through the various points he raised, and if there are ones we think need a little further reflection, we could deal with them in a separate written submission.<\/p> <p>  I will deal first with the consumer protection element of regulations and building standards that Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned and whether we would prefer to see the consumer protection element dealt with first and the register dealt with separately.  The Law Reform Commission examined precisely this issue in 1977 in its working paper on liability of vendors and lessors of defective premises.  In that paper it deals in detail with the proposed registration system for builders, which was under discussion between the Department with responsibility for the environment at the time and the Construction Industry Federation.<\/p><p>The way in which the Law Reform Commission envisaged the system would work was not dissimilar to the model proposed in the Bill, except it recommended that there should be a requirement for a bond in order to deal with the widespread problem of insolvencies in the construction sector that was perceived at the time.  Without dealing with the issue in great detail, the commission suggested the bond could be set at, for example, 1% of the purchase price of the house.  I am not suggesting this recommendation be implemented but pointing out that when this model was considered 40 years ago it was considered fundamental that this problem be fixed in addition to fixing the legal problems I identified.<\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission stated it would be useless to create a new set of legal remedies without addressing the fact that the builder may not be solvent and able to meet the claims.  Following publication of the Law Reform Commission's working paper, we had the introduction of HomeBond which, to this day, will not give claimants the same amount of money they could recover in an action under contract if they had access to the original contract.  HomeBond is more limited and subject to significant exclusions.  In each iteration of HomeBond, before it was underwritten by an insurer, it was subject to significant exclusions and limitations on what could be recovered.  We have been in this position previously.  The Law Reform Commission, in its working paper, stated we should not hold off on introducing these key elements of law reform until the register of builders is in place.  Here we are, 40 years later, still looking at the same issue.  Having said that, I believe both matters are fundamentally important and both should be progressed as a matter of political urgency.<\/p><p> On the point of the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>If I may clarify the point, Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn is arguing that these are not two separate issues and they need to be integrated in a single process as having a separate register and consumer protection function would not work properly.

That package does not seem to involve remedying the problems that were identified.  I am not the first person to identify these problems.  Having examined the issue in context, I now have the benefit of knowing what happened in the past 40 years.  The Law Reform Commission predicted this would be the case and argued that both elements should be advanced.  I share its concern that if law reform were enacted tomorrow morning to fix all the problems I have identified, it would not solve the problem of who will pay to fix the defects.  The lens through which I examined the Bill is the perspective of the consumer.  Who will pay to fix the defects?  When someone makes a complaint to this body will anyone come out to look at the defects or pay to fix them?<\/p> <p>  I want to make another point about the model and also with regard to learning from history.  The pyrite panel report of 2012 recommended that there should be a system in place for the registration or licensing of builders and cited the examples of the register of electrical contractors and the register of gas installers - Ms Hegarty referred to these.  Both of these registration systems operate under the supervision of an independent State regulatory authority, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  These bodies were appointed for a seven-year term in 2016 following a public procurement process.  As such, there is external oversight monitoring the schemes and what they do.  This is a world away from a system where one might have a registration body that is not accountable to anyone.  The only real accountability in this Bill and, arguably, the Building Control Act 2007 relating to the other regulated professions, is the requirement to publish an annual report.  This is another reason the Freedom of Information Act is very important.  If there is no accountability and no external body asking questions, it is down to members of the public to try to work out what is happening via the Freedom of Information Act.  This would suggest a real problem of accountability and governance. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to models used in other countries.  On my previous appearance before the committee, I referred to the licensing model in place in Australia and I would be happy to provide further information on that.  The key element of the international systems in place that are regarded as robust and effective are independence at various stages of the construction process.  When the World Bank considered what should be the key factors in its guidance for building regulation reform, one of the issues it mentioned was independent verification of design, which is not a feature of our building control regulations of 2014.<\/p> <p>  There are different elements to this.  What I tried to emphasise in my opening statement was that this particular model cannot be viewed in isolation.  It is a model that might work differently in another country but in Ireland it is in a highly complex and prejudicial set of existing relationships. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time as the meeting must conclude by noon.

The lack of certainty about what risks they are pricing is a disincentive to having affordable insurance, which is the ultimate consumer protection.  Having a privatised system in which the construction industry effectively polices itself, which is the system we currently have, is inherently risky and will be viewed as such.

Our President, Mr. Dominic Doheny, is in the Public Gallery with some other colleagues.<\/p><p> It is important to note at the outset that the CIF is a strong advocate for a statutory register for builders.  The CIF, in liaison with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, established the current CIRI register on a voluntary basis with the objective that it be placed on a statutory footing at the earliest possible date.  The CIF has consistently put the case to Government of the need to have such a statutory register in operation in the construction industry.  Such is the importance of protecting the consumer from any underqualified, unscrupulous, or incompetent operators that the CIF fully supports the commitment of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to put this register on a statutory footing.<\/p><p> The entire regulatory environment surrounding building control changed significantly when SI 9 of 2014, Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, came into effect.  The CIF gave its full support to the introduction of the statutory instrument and considered at that time that the remaining element of compliance to be addressed required the establishment of a formal registration process for builders wherein competence could be assessed by an independent admissions and registration board.  In the absence of legislation, the CIF established, in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the voluntary registration system, CIRI, while ensuring that the integrity and independence of the admissions and registration scheme was fully supported and maintained.  In excess of 800 large, medium and small builders and specialist contractors from all parts of the country are now on the voluntary register and have committed to continuing professional development and training requirements.  The CIF views its role as being a partner with Government in protecting the end users of buildings and ensuring and regulating compliance with building regulations and standards of conduct within the industry.  In the past, the good name and reputation of many professional and fully compliant builders, contractors and specialist contractors was tarnished by the acts of others who could classify themselves as builders and contractors without any independent assessment of their knowledge and experience within the complex industry we all now work in.<\/p><p> The CIF has invested heavily in its IT administrative platform to support the application and administrative processes surrounding the registration scheme and the online database for CIRI registered members.  Further investment is now ongoing in the establishment of an online induction programme to be undertaken by prospective members of CIRI and for monitoring by the CIRI admissions and registration board of registered members' continuing professional development obligations pertaining to CIRI membership.  A dedicated CPD office has also been established to assist members in meeting training and upskilling requirements.  It is the view of the CIF executive council that a fully functional registration system is a key requirement for the future reputation of our industry.  The council's view is that this system, modelled on that of other professional bodies such as RIAI, Engineers Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, is the most effective way for the consumer to identify competent builders and for authorities to identify those who should not be operating in our industry.  The CIF considers this system to be one of the last pieces of the jigsaw in providing a platform for the ongoing professionalisation of the entire construction industry.  Builders represent the only segment of a vast network of construction-related enterprises that are without a registration scheme to enforce standards.<\/p><p> The general scheme of the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill 2017, as published, is very much in line with the governance documents and procedures established in the current voluntary register.  The Minister's role in the draft legislation relating to the statutory CIRI register is welcome.  Under the proposed legislation, the Minister will prescribe regulations determining categories of registered members and classes of work; prescribe levels of previous experience or educational qualifications required for entry to the register; prepare a code of conduct specifying standards of conduct and practices to be adhered to by registrants; appoint the chairmen of the CIRI admissions and registration board, and the CIRI appeals committee; nominate five members to the CIRI admissions and registration board having consulted with the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; nominate two members to the CIRI appeals committee; consent to the making of rules for CIRI; specifies offences; and consent to the scale of fees payable on registration.<\/p><p> The role of the CIRI admissions and registration board is clearly defined in the draft Bill.  The board will decide on the eligibility of applicants for registration; make all decisions pertaining to registration of applicants; deals with all complaints concerning a registered member, pursuant to which it may cause an investigation to be carried out; appoint inspectors to carry out any investigation; publish sanctions as it sees fit; and provide policy and guidance materials as necessary to facilitate the registration process.  The legislation proposes that the board shall have a quorum of six members, the majority of whom shall be members who were nominated by the Minister.  The role of the CIF is clearly defined in the Bill to include preparation and publication of the CIRI annual report to include a financial statement to be certified by an auditor; and the appointment of five members of the CIRI admissions and registration board, two of whom must be registered construction professionals and non-members of CIRI.<\/p><p> The independence and integrity of the CIRI admissions and registration board is safeguarded under the legislation.  The CIF assumes the risk and cost pertaining to operations and for any legal challenges that may arise from builders who fail in their registration applications or are removed from the register for elements of non-compliance with any registration requirements.  Under the scheme of the Bill, as published, and as the current regime provides for, the CIF, while it is the registration body, has no influence whatsoever on the decision-making process of the CIRI admissions and registration board.  This is fully endorsed by the CIF.  In summary, the CIF fully supports the placing of CIRI on a statutory footing.  This registration scheme has been a central objective for the federation in putting in place a credible system to protect consumers, occupiers, end users of buildings, and in turn the reputation of our construction industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>On behalf of Construction Industry Register Ireland's admissions and registration board, which I will refer to hereafter as the CIRI board, I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation this morning on the general scheme of the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill 2017.<\/p> <p>  I am chairman of the CIRI board and with me is Mr. Liam Egan, who is also a member of the CIRI board.  Mr. Egan is a former assistant principal architect with the Office of Public Works and I am a chartered engineer with over 40 years' construction experience with a civil engineering contractor.  I retired in 2009.  The then Minister with responsibility for the environment consented to my nomination as inaugural chairperson of the CIRI board while Mr. Egan was nominated to his position by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the OPW.  Under the current voluntary CIRI scheme, the board has been in existence since March 2014.  That coincided with the introduction of SI 9 of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, or BCAR 2014 for short.  Since then, my colleagues and I on the CIRI board have established operating structures and procedures which govern our obligations to develop a register for all the companies which carry out the wide range of construction activity under the BCAR regime.<\/p> <p>  A great deal of work has been done over the past three years, including analysis of the complex and diverse range of construction related activities and their categorisation into various profiles of work for CIRI registration; determination of the minimum criteria for entrance onto the register and the qualifications and experience required in order to be registered for various categories of work; development of an online registration process and its continuous review to ensure that it is not overly burdensome for applicants while at the same time providing relevant and meaningful information to the board upon which to base its decisions; the establishment of an assessment subcommittee of the board to assess each of the applications for membership of the CIRI register; and the determination of the continuing professional development requirements that should pertain for all workers of registered construction entities.<\/p> <p>  Committee members will appreciate that as the regulatory environment for construction is constantly changing, there is a requirement for ongoing CPD.  That is a central and important aspect of our obligations.  There is an ongoing review of the code of ethics specifying the required ethical behaviour of members of the register and there is a determination of the practical process by which the board's assessment of individual applications for registration is undertaken and the basis under which formal decision making is made by the entire board.  We are also engaged in ongoing work to determine an appropriate complaints and appeals procedure.<\/p><p>In this regard, the Minister has recently consented to the appointment of Mr. Rory O'Donnell, who is a very well-known and respected solicitor, as independent chairman of the CIRI appeals committee.<\/p><p> Our entire board has been diligent and proactive in the carrying out of its functions since its establishment so that the objective of developing CIRI as a credible registration scheme would be achieved.  At the same time, the board has reviewed the general scheme as published by the Government and is intent on ensuring the amendments to the current processes under the voluntary scheme can now be put in place to reflect the proposed statutory scheme that will ultimately be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> I pay tribute to the CIRI board for the enthusiasm with which it has approached the development of the register and its commitment to the creation of a culture of compliance and continuing education within our industry.  Knowledge, skill, competence and practical construction-related experience are the hallmarks of every successful construction company and are the foundation on which CIRI will be based.<\/p><p> We welcome the publication of the general scheme and look forward to the proposed legislation coming into effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hank Fogarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fogarty.

It was interesting and helpful.  As I said from the outset, we all want a proper sustainable and robust construction industry, including mechanisms of control and ultimately redress for people who feel they were short-changed or in some way did not have a satisfactory outcome.<\/p> <p>  This morning's process was really important.  I want to recount the four key messages I have taken from our deliberations today and from previous presentations we have had.  They get to the kernel of the issue.  I would like the witnesses to respond briefly to this.  There was a suggestion that there is inadequate consumer protection, particularly for home buyers, and that there is no mechanism for consumer redress.  We are told there are inherent conflicts of interest with CIRI in terms of independence.  The CIF is an organisation with a track record of lobbying.  My observation from reading media is that it is a particularly good lobbyist.  That is its right and it would be failing its members if it did not do that.  I acknowledge it is an important part of its work.  It is now seeking a regulatory role in the same sector in which it is operating.  Outside of here, people are saying it cannot be judge and jury in its own cause.  Our job is to tease out the issues.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the absence of independent regulatory oversight of CIRI, which is not in accordance with best practice.  That is what is being suggested.  The final issue is that restrictions on the activities of builders and trades people is not in compliance with EU law and specifically the service directive.  <\/p> <p>  There are a number of challenges.  We need answers to some of those because they are very serious.  Ultimately, it is about confidence in the sector for CIRI and the consumer.  Will the witnesses deal specifically with those challenges?  Perhaps they will refute them but we need to hear it from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#P00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>What we have said is it is about consumer protection.  I am ten years with the CIF this week, ever since I left the esteemed House here.  The Construction Industry Federation wants to support and represent a very solid, sound, reputable industry, which is the bulk of our people.  That reputation was sullied by some people, often referred to as cowboys, who did not have the qualifications and so on.  Reputation is a very valuable business asset for organisations, industry and individuals.  This is very much about protecting our reputation against unscrupulous people.  Mr. Hank Fogarty said CIRI is absolutely independent and committed to consumer protection and the culture of compliance.  The new building regulations are a whole new ball game in terms of compliance and how we produce buildings.  Every building has to have an assigned certifier.  It has to be signed off and there has to be insurance to cover that particular signature.  It is confined to chartered engineers, chartered surveyors, chartered building surveyors and architects.  From the consumer protection point of view, it is the last piece of the jigsaw.  When hiring people from this register, the consumer has to be assured of their professionalism, competence, trustworthiness, compliance, tax compliance, insurance compliance, health and safety compliance and that they have completed all previous projects.  It ticks all the boxes.  Professionals who have to sign off on somebody when they are accepting tenders will be able to check if he or she is on the register.  It will save a lot of hassle and time.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point about the lack of oversight, the Minister has major input into all the different areas.  I have much confidence in the House and how it develops legislation, and particularly in this process because people from all different political persuasions come in.  We had two very eminent professionals in earlier who have identified shortcomings from an academic point of view.  The Bill is in the process of being put together.  It will be the biggest asset to consumer confidence that we have ever seen in the construction sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>I will deal with the issue of conflict of interest.  A comment was made about a set of prejudicial relationships.  One has to understand the difference.  The situation with the voluntary admissions board, that is, the CIRI board, which is in place at the moment, is that I am proposed by the CIF and my nomination is accepted by the Minister.  I am not the Minister's nominee.  There are five people nominated by the CIF, three members and two independent construction professionals.  On the other side, there are five Government-appointed members of the board.  That is the system.  That seems to infer there is an \"us\" and a \"them\" but there never has been.  In the three years we have been in existence, we have never once split along party lines.  We have been unanimous in everything we have done.  The important thing is when the scheme becomes a statutory scheme, the Minister will have control of it.  I will not be reappointed.  I suspect he will appoint his own person as the chairman and his five members and will have control of the board.  If there is ever a conflict of interest, he will be able to deal with it very effectively.  It is not true to say the CIF is policing itself.  What possible interest would I have at this stage of my career in having a registered entity that is not the full shilling?  Why would the CIF want that?  It is damaging to the reputation of the industry and good contractors.  More than 90% are good contractors.  There is no interest in having that arrangement.  I cannot see the conflict of interest or the prejudicial relationships.  We do not police ourselves.  We are a fully independent board.  We have always acted like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hank Fogarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>As always I have more questions than the Vice Chairman would like but I will make them very brief.  If the witnesses would like to give written responses rather than go through them all, I have no problem with that.<\/p> <p>  The issue from our point of view is not about rogue builders; it is about ensuring there is a proper regulatory framework that is good for the industry, the employees in the industry and the people who buy the product.  If we get this regulatory system right, everybody will benefit from it.  Unfortunately, until now the extent of defects suggests the problem is not just the odd untrained rogue builder but the absence of a proper regulatory regime.  That meant that even non-rogue builders or people who in other circumstances would have been reputable did things or allowed things to be done under their watch that have left families with huge financial and emotional consequences.  I want to put that in context.<\/p> <p>  I have not heard a convincing response on the issue of independence yet.  If I am not wrong, CIRI will have a register with a very large number of people and companies on it.  Some of those people and companies will also be members of the Construction Industry Federation on whose behalf CIRI will advocate, but others will not.  If I am wrong in that, the witnesses should correct me.<\/p><p>Does that in itself create some kind of dynamics because on the one hand, the CIF is advocating on behalf of its members but on the other, it is playing a regulatory role for both members and employees of some of those members?  I have some questions around that.  <\/p><p> I would also like to hear the CIF's direct response to the suggestion that a better model would not be the professional association model, as is the case with architects, but the type of model that exists with electricians and gas workers both in terms of the independent inspections that follow a consumer complaint but also the independent statutory oversight of a regulator because they are two very different models.  I was quite taken by the previous speaker's proposal.<\/p><p> The issue about conflicts of interest is not because we think anybody in the room is currently engaged in a conflict of interest.  However, if we ensure that the system is designed in such a way that this is not possible, everybody is protected.  To go back to the comments of Ms Hegarty and Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn about the issue of Chinese walls, even from a public perception point of view, if I am the person making the complaint then I am making the telephone call to the same number and the same building.  That does not suggest that there is an institutional separation.  How do the witnesses think the Bill could be strengthened to deliver that?<\/p><p> I am a bit concerned about board composition because it is possible under the current heads of Bill for a majority of the board members to be industry.  They do not all have to be registered but they could be within the broad construction development industry.  There are five industry nominees, five Government nominees and a chair with a list of people such as a former judge of the Circuit, High or Supreme Courts or a registered construction professional, so there could be a six or seven-person industry majority on the board.  I take the point that this does not necessarily mean it is a case of \"them\" or \"us\" but it means people are bringing specific backgrounds to the board.  Do the witnesses not think that for public confidence, it would be much better if there was no possibility of an industry majority and, crucially, if the chair is not from the industry to have that independent function?  <\/p><p> I am interested in finding out what difference the witnesses think the operation of the voluntary register has made to date in practical terms.  Crucially, could they share with the committee either now or as soon as they can in writing the number of consumer complaints that have been submitted to CIRI, the number of sanctions that have been issued and the number of exclusions from the register because it is quite important for us to assess whether or not the register has made any difference?  The witnesses may not be able to or may not wish to answer this now but a question was asked at a previous meeting.  There are people trading in the industry who were directly responsible for Priory Hall, Longboat Quay and a host of other ones.  At the back of our minds is the question of whether they on this register.  Was any attempt made to ask whether some of those people should not have been allowed on to the register to give it that credibility?<\/p><p> Will CIRI be the competent authority in terms of EU-regulated professions for construction workers in Ireland?  When construction workers from outside this jurisdiction are coming into Ireland, will CIRI be the body under EU law that is required to register those construction workers?  How will it deal with the issue of whether those construction workers or employers have been non-compliant in their jurisdictions, whether they have convictions, sanctions or whatever else?<\/p><p> Where does the developer sit in all this because I am clear about the construction workers and the employers.  If I am a developer rather than a builder, do I register?  Do I have a role in this role?  Is that not then a gap in terms of the regulatory function because, again, if we go back to some of the examples we have used like Longboat Quay or Priory Hall, while there was a lot of responsibility, the developer had a big responsibility?  <\/p><p> My final question is one that Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn made clearest.  What consumers want to know is who is going to pay.  When they discover life-changing defects in their property that have a huge financial cost, who will foot the bill?  I put this question to the Department and I said that it is very long and complicated legal process where someone goes around the houses regarding whether it involved the developer, builder, architect or the sub-contracted untrained guy who put in the fire stopping.  The Department could not answer the question so could the witnesses explain how this will change that so that we will find out who is responsible for paying if something is found to be remiss and who foots the bill if that person is no longer solvent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#P00700","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>A range of issues have been raised that relate to both CIRI and the CIF.  I will deal with a number of them, particularly from a CIF perspective.  Regarding the protection of the consumer, which refers to one of the previous questions as well, the insurance policies available today to new home owners are very different from the insurance policies that pertained ten years ago.  There are a number of operators in the market that provide what is in effect latent defects insurance.  This insurance policy is first party insurance cover.  The policyholder does not have to go through the builder.  In addition, the policy attaches to the house.  It does not attach to the builder or the first and only occupier.  The policy is still in place so the home owner will go to the insurance company.  This will apply in respect of defective workmanship, design and materials and will apply for a ten-year period.  It offers much greater cover than applied previously.  There is a policy for &euro;200,000 for buildings and &euro;50,000 for mechanical equipment so it is quite significant.  I do no think the general public appreciates the significant difference in policy cover that pertains today compared to what pertained previously.  Traditionally, the old builder warranty insurance would have been available but that had to go through the builder.  This is no longer the case.

By and large, any builder who goes out to build a house to sell it on the open market will automatically get this insurance cover because a potential home buyer who goes out to secure a mortgage will only secure a mortgage on the grounds that this insurance is in place so while it is not mandatory, it is <i>de facto<\/i>a requirement for anybody who wants to build and sell a house on the open market.  That is fully supported by the industry.  We have no problem with that whatsoever.<br\/><br\/>In respect of poor workmanship, I believe the building control environment today is very different.  The culture of compliance is totally different from what pertained prior to the passing of SI 9 of 2014.  There is increased consciousness that an owner must appoint a competent builder and the builder must then appoint a competent team.  We believe the CIRI registration process will certainly support that process in ensuring that only competent people are appointed for each stage of the construction process.  A much more stringent level of oversight pertains to the construction of buildings.  We have the assigned certifier and key inspections that are undertaken on buildings during the course of building work.  We, as an industry, certainly do not want what happened in the past in terms of the experience of a number of home owners where defective workmanship was found and caused great grief to happen again.  We, as an industry, want to ensure that we have a properly regulated industry where regulation is fully transparent and credible and works at the end of the day in the interests of the consumer.  There are a number of issues there that would be more appropriately dealt with via the CIRI team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>I will start with the issue of complaints.

We are discussing the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill 2017, which effectively proposes that the State outsource control and that the industry effectively regulates the industry.  I have listened to the contribution of Mr. Parlon.  I thought it was interesting that he praised the contributions of the two academics who addressed the committee a short while ago.  He said that the two academics had identified important shortcomings in the Bill.<\/p><p>He omitted to mention that the main shortcoming that the two academics identified was the level of control that they felt this Bill gives the industry in regulating itself.<\/p><p> I want to address some questions, mainly on the issue of bogus self-employment and the direct relationship between bogus self-employment, which is rife in the industry, and poor quality construction and the failure to meet regulations.  I believe there is a direct link between the two and that we cannot discuss one without discussing the other.  I say bogus self-employment is rife within the industry, and that is not off the top of my head.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for example, says that 30,000 people are currently bogusly self-employed in the construction industry.  The Construction Workers Alliance feels that is a conservative figure.  They say there could be as many as 60,000 currently employed in the construction industry who are bogusly self-employed.  That has a dual effect.  It has an effect on the rights and conditions of the worker with regard to denial of sick pay, holiday pay, pensions and workers sometimes working, in effect, for less than the minimum wage.  I contend that it also has a major effect on compliance and building regulations.  If a contract is put out to tender and a builder applies for the job, claiming to be able to lay a certain number of blocks in a certain time with a certain amount of people and if it is the cheapest tender submitted and is accepted, as such tenders often are, how can the building be delivered in a way that is not rushed?<\/p><p> We saw a concrete example of this recently.  A raid was done on the Dolphin House flats refurbishment scheme's main contractor, Purcell Construction, in July.  The raid was conducted by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, people from the Department's Scope section and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  In some ways, it was a Mickey Mouse situation.  An outcome was that the authorities were able to announce in August that all the workers were properly signed up, compliant to taxes etc.  They did not say anything about the position in July, June, May or April when bogus self-employment was rife on that scheme.  The chair of the housing strategic policy committee of Dublin City Council has stated publicly that he believes the electrical work on that particular project is below par and there are major questions to be asked about it, and that it is linked to the question of bogus self-employment.<\/p><p> It is not just a question of bogus self-employment.  In the recent crane operators dispute which was so prominent at the start of summer, the crane operators alleged non-compliance by employers when it came to the issues of pay, training and safety.  The best practice for training for a crane driver, as applies to not just New York or Dubai but to Dublin and Ireland too, is to have six months of training.  Yet there are people being hired, given a few days of training and, at the end of the week, being put in charge of operating big cranes on big building sites in this city and in this country.  How can we have proper health and safety, and applications of building regulations and standards to the highest level when that type of operation is being implemented by members of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF?  It is not just one or two rogue members of the CIF, but members across the board.  It is widespread in that regard.<\/p><p> Considering the idea that the responsibility for the regulation of the industry using these standards would be placed in the hands of industry, after all I have said, I will compliment Mr. Parlon and the five men from the CIF.  They have come in here this morning with a straight face and welcomed these proposals when, back in CIF headquarters, they must be laughing to beat the band that political parties in this House in the form of the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that are prepared to support the industry effectively regulating the industry.  In effect, the fox is in charge of the henhouse.  Even if one was to try to put a pretty bow on this package, what one would do, at least, is say that Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, board must have significant representation for workers in the industry and for trade unions.  We do not even have that.  It is employers' legislation for employers.  I am sure Mr. Parlon and the CIF representatives will deny that now and attempt to refute it but anyone looking at this in a serious fashion will see that this is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#Q00600","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>I have to refute that absolutely.  It is a very serious attack on the reputation of the industry.  The Deputy is talking about health and safety.  I do not know whether it reached his notice that this is national construction safety week and that a massive investment has been made in the industry together with workers in the safety partnership, the unions and so on to make sites safer.  Big investment has been all over the media.  There was a stand-down on every site at noon last Monday.  Every worker in the country stood still for a moment to think about the safety implications.  There was massive investment by the industry in health and safety issues.  As a result, we have a very good record.  We continue to have unfortunate incidents but they are very limited and are generally in small sites with small operators.<\/p> <p>  I do not know why the crane dispute that the Deputy raised comes into this but the suggestion that that has something to do with training or health and safety is wrong.  As the Deputy knows, that was a result of an inter-union dispute between Unite and SIPTU.  Crane drivers were used as part of that battle and the industry got tied up in it.  It has now gone through proper process in the WRC and is awaiting a recommendation from the Labour Court, which is the proper channel through which it should be handled.  We have extremely good relations with the unions.  Unite caused an issue because it was trying to win members from other unions but, other than that, we have a very good record with labour groups.<\/p> <p>  As for the bogus self-employed, I know it was mentioned in the earlier presentation that there are over 200,000 individuals within the industry, self-employed or otherwise.  The CIF does not condone bogus self-employment, nor do its members.  There are many individuals and the industry has changed very substantially now in that, traditionally and originally, big companies hired all of their own tradesmen.  Now they hire professional subcontractors to handle most elements.  We certainly do not condone bogus self-employment.  If anything, CIRI will weed that out because, as I will let CIRI's board tell, it has been quite a challenge for member firms to get registered.  Before one can become a member of the CIF, one has to go through a very serious process.  We do not allow in people if we have issues with their integrity or competence.  I will let the board respond about the scrutiny that applies to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>I do not recognise the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, board the Deputy describes.  We do not have any role in relation to bogus employment.  We are, to some extent, peripheral to the question of compliance.  Our role is to register builders, to encourage a culture of compliance with the ethics and to raise the standards within construction entities.  That is our primary role.  I do not recognise the Deputy's point regarding a lack of independence in circumstances where the Minister makes appointments, although I take his point regarding construction.  I see no conflict in having a person in construction of a particular point of view being appointed by the Minister.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that there are 150,000 entities.  There are not even 150,000 people working in the construction industry.  The CSO figures are based on a particular set of criteria, which if one drills down into them indicate that the number of people working in the industry is considerably less than 150,000.  We believe there will be between 3,000 and 5,000 registered entities at the end of this process, all of whom will be members.  There is no conflict with European law.  We have registered people from Northern Ireland but have not yet registered anybody outside of the island of Ireland.  As far as I am concerned we could not possibly be in breach of EU law.  We require people wishing to register to meet minimum criteria.  For example, they must adhere to the rules regarding the code of ethics and the code of conduct, train their workers on an ongoing basis, provide CPD plans and advise us on how well they have done in that regard, which will be subject to audit.  We are a separate entity.  We are only part of the fabric.  Compliance with the building regulations is guided by the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR.  Much of the history of the bad building practices occurred before they were in place.  Now, somebody can be held responsible in this area.  There are a number of redress options available since 2014.  We are a support in that regard.  Compliance with the regulations will be guided by BCAR or whatever other system the Government wants to put in place.  It is our job to register builders and to ensure, in as far as possible, that we have compliant people on our register.  That is our focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#S00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hank Fogarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>On the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017102600002#S00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>Sorry, Deputy Barry, I will allow you back in later.

About one year ago my colleagues and I in the Romanian Parliament with responsibility for the labour function commenced a tour of the northern countries of Europe.  As has been recognised at European level, northern countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Ireland have very good and solid systems of social protection and social insurance.<\/p><p>For the last 30 years, since the political system changed, we have been trying to find a way - we still have some work to do on the public pensions system - to establish a social insurance system along the lines of that in a European-style welfare state.  We have learned a great deal and are still in the process of getting further information.  We got lots of answers from the members' colleagues in the Government and learned that Ireland's pensions system was established in 1961 and still in place.  We would like to know how it is possible that it lasted and is still working today.  My immediate feeling is that maybe it is not one of the best contributory systems but is rather redistributive.  It is a system which is accepted by Irish citizens and the Government and one which we can see is accepted by the majority and brings peace within the social Department.  Since 1989 we have had three pension laws or reforms and are now in the process of establishing a new one.  The general sense is that no matter how much one tries to respect and abide by each person's contributions during their working life, there are still some people who are not content or are unhappy with what they receive, especially in the social public system.<\/p><p> We would also like know what the relationship is between industrial management and the trade unions, between employees and employers.

I will begin and colleagues who wish to contribute may then do so.  <\/p> <p>  In his opening remarks Mr. Solomon raised the matter of pensions.  Ireland is no different from many other countries.  While we have a system that operates, it is not without its challenges.<\/p><p>In fact, the State pension operates in two parts, namely, contributory and non-contributory.  People pay into a Social Insurance Fund that funds the contributory State pension, while the non-contributory State pension is means-tested.  We are an aging population and people are living longer.  Without an increase in the annual pension and just to accommodate new pensioners, the additional funding required on a year-by-year basis is &euro;200 million per annum.<\/p><p> In relation to the contributory pension, for which workers pay during their working lives, the system at present is under scrutiny, with a view to introducing a new type of system.  The reason is that it is based on an average contribution over a person's working life rather than the person's total contributions.  The averaging system has some anomalies in it, and particular groups of people have been dealt with unfairly because their annual average is not high enough.  For a pension system to work effectively for those who contribute to it, it is important we have a system of credits that acknowledges periods of time when people cannot work for whatever reason, whether to rear a family or care for somebody.  Our national Budget Statement was made a couple of weeks ago, and the issue of the contributory pension and annual averaging has received considerable debate.  The Government is committed to changing it over the course of a number of years.  This committee will scrutinise and evaluate its proposals as they become available.

I hope they are finding their trip enjoyable and informative.  I hope their engagement with the committee this morning can be of some use.  Many areas have been touched on and time will be precious here.  I am interested in a couple of areas, including the issue of pensions, which has been touched on.  It has been dealt with fairly comprehensively by the previous speakers.  Many changes have been made to the pension system in Ireland in recent years, including the pensionable age.  I am interested to hear what the situation is in Romania.  The pension age moved from 65 to 66 in Ireland.  In 2021 it will move to 67 and up to 68 in 2028.  In Romania, I believe the retirement ages are different for men and women.  I believe it is 63 for women and 65 for men.  I would like some feedback on how the system in Romania works and whether there are any planned changes to increase the pension age.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland in 2012, serious changes were made to the contributory pension in terms of contribution, and this ties in with gender-proofing because the changes that were made in 2012 were not gender-proofed and had a direct impact on women in particular.  Subsequent to the changes, almost 70% of women are on lower contributory pensions.  The changes did not take into account the time that women take out of work to raise families or to look after loved ones.  There is much focus on this now, and the Government has said it is moving to a new total contribution system, but this will not come into place until 2020 or 2021.   There are a lot of pressures and focus on this.<\/p> <p>  My colleague touched on the unemployment rate in Romania.  To come at it from a slightly different angle, youth unemployment in Ireland is double the national figure of 6% or 6.5%.  Youth unemployment is probably 12% or 13%.  Are there similarities in Romania in terms of youth unemployment?  We have specific job activation schemes in Ireland targeting the long-term unemployed.  I have difficulties with lot of them but there are some positive schemes.  Are there specific job activation schemes in Romania?  How do they work?  Are they useful?<\/p> <p>  I did a little bit of research and found an interesting point.<\/p><p>Although I am not certain whether this is the case, my understanding is that in Romania, a bereavement grant is available to everybody when a family member passes away.  A bereavement grant was available in Ireland some years ago but it has been abolished.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017102600002#F00400","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509013800,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I welcome all of the witnesses.  Other speakers have touched on the pension system in terms of the historical context.  The main concerns regarding the pension system were flagged in a Government Green Paper in 2007, which I would recommend.  It deals with the first tier, second tier and third tier question.  It was, of course, followed by the crash and so many of the issues highlighted and discussed therein were put aside.  I understand some of the problems identified have become further embedded.  <\/p> <p>  As stated, we do have some good redistributive elements within our pension system but we also have problems within our contributory system.  The averaging system we had effectively served to penalise people who had the required number of years' contributions but not in a row.  For example, in the case of people who had worked in their teens or 20s and who were then out of the workplace for ten or 15 years before taking up employment again, their pensions were lowered because of the averaging system.  This particularly affected women because many of them had lower levels of contributions.  This became more impactful in 2012, when we moved to lower the payments and we introduced new band systems, which in some cases severely reduced the pensions of people who had lower levels of contributions.  This happened even though it had been acknowledged since 2007 that the system was not fair.<\/p> <p>  Another important issue is how care is recognised in our system.  There is one small measure which addresses a tiny part of the problem in averaging, namely, the homemaker's disregard which was introduced in the mid-1990s.  While this allows for a certain number of years in respect of homemaking or care to be discounted for the averaging process, the problem is that many of the women affected were out of the workforce between 1973 and the 1990s.  Many women's organisation believe it is not sufficient to only have a disregard for care and that we should have a recognition for care through the introduction of a care credit or care contribution.  This will be a challenge if we move to a second tier.  For example, in introducing a universal supplementary retirement savings scheme, how do we ensure that care and other forms of contributions outside of employment are recognised in the system?  Another concern on the universal supplementary retirement savings scheme is the increase in precarious work, which results in people having many more gaps in their work lifetime than was previously the case.  If we move to a total contribution approach for the first year, or if we introduce a second-tier system, it will be important to find a way to ensure that care and other contributions are recognised.  This is one challenge we will face, as well as the immediate challenge of how to rectify the unfair 2012 changes, which disproportionately impacted women who already were being treated unfairly by the system.<\/p> <p>  We have a non-contributory pension which is means tested.  While it is positive that we have a non-contributory pension, because it is means tested it is not always a solution for women, as their partners may have means of some kind or may have a pension.  There is a concern around financial independence for women and their being able to access money in their own right.  Many of them may not qualify for the non-contributory pension, which means that in some cases women have no access to finance in their later years.  These are some of the issues we are teasing out in Ireland.  I am very interested in this area and I would be very interested to hear about some of the many measures that have been tried in Romania.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to employer contributions, we do not yet have a formal system of employment contribution directly to pensions, as is proposed in regard to the universal supplementary retirement savings scheme.  We are currently experiencing a problem with pay-related social insurance, PRSI, which I think is increasingly becoming an issue across Europe.  In Ireland, employers pay a set portion of PRSI and employees pay another portion and this money goes into the Social Insurance Fund.  We are experiencing a rise in bogus self employment, however, whereby people are categorising themselves as self-employed when in fact they are working with one employer who employs everybody on individual contracts and thereby can bypass the requirement to pay social insurance contributions on behalf of employees.  We recently dealt with Opposition legislation, which was supported by the Government, to address the issue of bogus self-employment, which is a drain on our system.<\/p> <p>  On the point made by Ms Calista, gender equality is a key concern.  I previously worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland.  During that time, the council was constantly pushing Government to introduce gender and equality proofing of the budget, a measure it has since agreed to but is not yet in practice.  It is important now to ensure that is done.  Another key concern is lone parents.  I would be interested in hearing what supports are in place in Romania for those who are parenting alone.  This cohort of people experience high levels of deprivation and consistent poverty.  There have been some changes to our system in this regard.  As a committee, we produced a report, which I am sure can be shared with the witnesses, recommending changes in this area.  I am sure that report would be of interest to the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  In regard to disability, my colleague in the Seanad, Senator John Dolan, is head of the Disability Federation.  I can provide the witnesses with his contact details if they so wish.  The issue of child protection was mentioned.  A very positive development in this area was our referendum on the rights of the child.  It applies across all areas in that in any issue that affects children, the child's individual rights rather than the rights of his or parents or family must be considered.  That referendum was a major change in Ireland in recent years.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to the point made by Mr. Vexler on minority groupings, we are just pushing towards legislation on sign language recognition.  We are starting that journey in Ireland.  There are issues facing particular groups.  The Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland face issues related to social protection and so on.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. Vexler's views on Ireland's habitual residency condition, which requires people to have been two years in Ireland and contributing thereto before they are able to access social protection, which affects everybody and not only minority groups.  Perhaps we might hear from the embassy on the impact of this condition on the Romanian community here, which, I think, is approximately 35,000.  On the cultural issues, I would be very happy to discuss them later over lunch. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017102600002#G00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509013800,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>It is going to be an interesting lunch.<\/p><p>Just before I allow Deputy Gino Kenny in, I would like to say that in Ireland we have 40 multi-seat constituencies.

It is true that in Romania the official unemployment rate is 4.5%.  This is just for registered unemployed people who are actually getting a payment.  Two years afterwards, they stop getting a payment and enter into another category, which is people unemployed but socially assisted.  We have almost 4 million Romanian people scattered all over Europe, active, and there are almost 60,000 Romanians here in Ireland.  In Italy we have about 1 million Romanians and the same in Spain.  If all these people were back in Romania, they might not have a job.  The rate or percentage the Deputy mentioned would then be much higher.  Most of those who are in Romania are either young or over 45 years old.  These are the two main categories in the unemployment rate.  There are Government programmes which fund jobs for two years after unemployment.  The employer is obligated to keep the person for one more year once the two years are finished.  The occupational office agency administers specific jobs and training for all of the unemployed people.  On a monthly basis, they can participate in training, courses and grants.  It is called the grant for jobs.  We have training, programmes and apprenticeships for those who finish college or school and want to go straight into the workforce.  Many of them are funded by the European Union.  One is the youth grant.  Unfortunately the biggest problem for us is not the unemployment rate but people who are too highly qualified for the jobs that are on the market.  We feel this issue is getting worse in all areas.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked about the pension age.  Before 2035, we need to implement the same pension age for women and men.  It is an obligation under a directive from the European Union.  The new Bill was published yesterday by the Ministry of employment.  They consider the possibility for mothers who have had more than three children to have the pension age lowered by between one and three years.  Those who wish to still work after the pension age, depending of course on the individual circumstances, could stay in the workforce until the age of 70.  The bereavement grant that was mentioned is paid from social insurance at the level of the national net average salary.  Those who are not insured can receive only half of the grant.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Gino Kenny asked about the social welfare rate.  There are supplementary benefits for families with more children and one-parent families.  There are also back-to-school supplements, for high school in our case.<\/p><p>There is a minimum amount for people who, for various reasons, cannot be in the workforce.  They would have to work a certain number of hours for the community to receive this.  There are supplementary benefits for people with disabilities.  The entire budget for social protection would also include the protection of the child at a national level.  It is somewhere in the region of &euro;7 billion to &euro;8 billion per year.  This does not include pensions and local community contributions.  They represent between 20% and 30% of the total payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017102600002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Solomon","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1509013800,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>Deputy John Curran resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509013800,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I will answer two questions for Deputy Gino Kenny.  Romania has ratified the UN convention.  We have ratified it but we do not have the same percentage of accessibility as Ireland, although I understand that Ireland has not yet ratified the convention.  Another problem we now face in Romania, hence my earlier question regarding people with disabilities, is how we can make them feel important. encourage them want to work in some field, whether public or private, and allow them to do so rather than paying them to stay at home.  For example, one might not have a hand or a leg or such and be given money by the state to stay at home.  That is not a solution.  The solution to bring them with us and make them feel like real citizens, actually doing something for the community because they can.  There are people who can think and write, who might not be able to hear but can see or who might have other combinations of disabilities.  One of our main focuses in Romania is how to get these people into employment.  To do so, one needs to have a ramp for them to get into institutions, for example, to enable people to get from the first floor to the second floor or to have a bathroom adapted for them.  These are the minimum accessibility priorities we must facilitate in the context of these people in order to allow them to come to us - the public institutions - and to the private sector.  At the same time, however, we should be there for them.  In Romania, we are now focusing on how to increase the number of people with disabilities in the public and private sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017102600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mara-Daniela Calista"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509013800,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>I can see that Senator Higgins is anxious to speak.

We can discuss that in more detail.  There is a very delicate balance.  I think the delegation is right to focus on institutions, points of access and the question of giving supports.
