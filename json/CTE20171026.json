It concerns the IDA's recent appearance at the committee.  It had been asked for a more detailed note on how it verifies the job creation numbers it presented to this committee.  There was some discussion on how the IDA calculates what jobs are created from its clients and how ConnectIreland does it.  I have forwarded two notes or forms to the secretariat.  It is extraordinary, because what the IDA said when it was before the committee was that 14,000 jobs were created last year.  The IDA verifies the jobs by asking the relevant company to fill in a form.  The form, which I forwarded to the secretariat, is an annual employment survey.  It simply has two boxes.  The checks involve making sure that the form was filled in.  The form is sent out to companies and the companies respond by saying how many jobs were created.  There is no follow-up in terms of linking it with revenue, payroll or PRSI.  That can be juxtaposed with the process that ConnectIreland is asked to go through.  It has a responsibility to identify how the jobs are created.  The company has to prepare a spreadsheet with the name of the employee, employee position, start date and end date.  The IDA, at its discretion, can talk to the companies.  It can get permission to view payroll reports, bank statements, latest P30s and samples of employee contracts.  It is much more robust.  It certainly is the case that for ConnectIreland, a very detailed process was in place to prove that the jobs that were created were actually created.  However, in the case of the IDA, a straightforward self-assessment letter is sent out and that seems to be the process.<\/p> <p>  This is important.  I am not doubting the figures or saying that the figures that were presented to us were not genuine.  However, I am concerned about the process.  It is questionable whether the figure presented to us can be independently verified.  These are figures which guide policy.  Perhaps we should wait until the detailed note comes back from the IDA, but it appears that there are double standards here in terms of how the IDA requests ConnectIreland to verify its jobs while having a much simpler process itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I understand and completely appreciate what the Deputy has said.  I received a similar copy of that correspondence yesterday but it has not been circulated to the committee as it arrived too late.  However, we have written to the IDA directly on this topic, following on from the earlier correspondence from ConnectIreland.  We want a detailed response on that, and we will forward this documentation to it as well.  It will be circulated to the members of the committee shortly.  The question that arises is what happens when the questionnaires are not returned.  What figure does the IDA take in that instance?  I am very interested in the questionnaires that are not signed by the companies and returned.  We want to check the verification, but when forms do not come back, we want to know how the IDA comes up with a number.  I am sure it has some mechanism to count the jobs in particular companies.  We will add that to our list of questions for the IDA.  I have no doubt that we will have a detailed discussion when we receive the reply from the IDA and will proceed from there.  We will ask the secretariat to encourage the IDA to respond as promptly as possible.<\/p> <p>  That arises out the minutes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>While it might be better to raise this issue when discussing the work programme, will we deal with the issues that arose around the Eversheds memo and the legal advice received now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B00900","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>As it is in the work programme, we definitely will come to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#B01100","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We will move on to correspondence.

Correspondence item No. 820C (i &ndash; ii) is correspondence dated 11 October 2017 from Ms Niamh Larkin, director of audit in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, updating the committee on correspondence regarding Meath County Council.  A matter relating to the legal status of certain companies that have contracts with Meath County Council had been raised by an individual and this was referred by the previous committee to the Department in January 2016.  The letter advises that the local government auditor for Meath County Council met the correspondent in July 2016 and has corresponded with him a number of times from January 2016 to date.  She advised the correspondent in July 2016 that his correspondence did not fall within the definition of an objection, and on 14 July 2017 she confirmed to the correspondent that it was not intended to take any further action.  A copy of the correspondence to the individual is attached.  I propose we note that.  It has been looked at locally by the local government audit.  I propose we note it and move on because Meath County Council is not within the remit of this committee.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence item No. 821C (i &ndash; ii), dated 17 October 2017, from Ms Patricia Quinn, managing director, Benefacts, enclosing information for the committee about the database of Irish non-profits comprising extensive governance, regulatory and financial data and analysis.

The secretariat has proposed having representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS, the funders of the ETBs, attend the first session together.  I would like everyone to be present for the full meeting.  In other words, I want the chairmen and chief executives of the two education and training boards to be present for the session with the Department and SOLAS.

I want all the groups to be fully aware of what is being said, although we will provide time for different sections.  We do not want to take a silo approach.  We want everyone present throughout.  We will start the meeting with an information session with the Department and SOLAS.

However, I also asked the secretariat to choose the best education and training board and Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board seems to be doing its business properly.  If it can do things right, why can the rest of them not do things right too?  We want to pick out some elements of good practice and tell the other boards they do not have any excuses because their counterparts elsewhere are doing things right.  We want to have a contrast.  Rather than bringing in the bottom half of the class, to use an educational term, we are bringing in examples of good practice.

I am fascinated about where the money comes from to do that kind of thing.  There is undoubtedly an issue.  It is important that if Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board comes in, we are all circulated with the 2010 report beforehand because we need to know the history as much as the current issue that is under investigation.  It is also useful to look not just at geographic areas but the number of schools.  An area might be small but might have many schools that are under its remit.

The complication that arose was the necessity for clarity on a memo that has come into the possession of the committee and is now a document of the committee as I understand it.  It has been circulated to us and forms part of our papers.  Clarity was required about the extent to which or whether legal privilege applied to that document.  I also understood that we would seek legal clarity, a legal opinion or legal advice on that matter.

Second, and this is important, when Mr. McEnery was here he did speak about the meeting so that notwithstanding the notes he did talk about what happened at that meeting.  His response to a question as to whether a boycott of the fair deal scheme was discussed was yes, it was, but he was not party to it and did not support it.  There were only two parties in the room, himself and Nursing Homes Ireland, so if he did not initiate, support or take part in a discussion on a boycott, and he acknowledges that discussion took place, then Nursing Homes Ireland did.

The figure for nursing home support scheme - fair deal private nursing homes only - is &euro;623 million in 2016.  The cost of public nursing homes is &euro;333 million.  That is a bigger figure than fair deal.  Not everyone who is in a nursing home is on a fair deal scheme.

I am accompanied by Ms Colley, the chief officer of CHO area 5, which is the relevant CHO area.  She joined the HSE in September 2015.  Therefore, it is important to point out that she would not have had any involvement in the matters in the south east prior to that date.<br\/><br\/>I am mindful that, in addressing these concerns, I have taken the time to consider a number of issues addressed to committee members by the provider in correspondence dated 4 October 2017.  It is important to preface my opening statement in the knowledge that matters of concern for this committee are also germane to the statutory investigation that is sitting.<br\/><br\/>In addressing the matters in the service provider's correspondence to the committee, I wish to provide important background and context leading to the final 20-page report and appendices issued to me, as commissioner of the review, by Deloitte on 15 September 2017.<br\/><br\/>During the course of my opening statement to the committee in February of last year, I discussed levels of funding for the voluntary provider for the years 2009 to 2015, inclusive.  The budget for the voluntary provider involved was set out together with a comparison of the percentage increase or decrease in budget relative to the percentage increase or reductions across the area and nationally.  In the course of the meeting, the then Chairman stated:<\/p><blockquote>I understand that Mr. O'Brien [me, of course] is going to have a discussion with it [the provider] and I know he will be fair about it.  I think when you look at the funding figures that you quoted in your opening statement, and factor in the work that had to be done and the care that had to be given, you will find that its funding actually decreased over the period.  I will not argue with you about the figures, but I am going to ask you to examine that table at some stage and be prepared to inform the next Committee of Public Accounts of the position.<\/blockquote> <p>Following the committee meeting, the figures were disputed by the voluntary provider in question.  As part of an engagement with the organisation, I gave a commitment that I would undertake an independent external review of funding, to which the provider was agreeable.  I commissioned Deloitte, an internationally recognised organisation, to undertake the review in accordance with the following terms of reference, which relate to the cost of care from 2009 to 2016 for a specific individual in the care of a service provider, and the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider from 2009 to 2015.<br\/><br\/>I now wish to address the serious allegations made by the service provider in its correspondence to the committee regarding the independence of the report.  Deloitte, as part of its methodology, undertook to engage with the provider and relevant HSE personnel and requested information from both parties.  As part of the process deployed, Deloitte exchanged a draft document with both parties and had further engagements with them regarding clarifications and inputs to the draft.  I understand that the methodology employed by Deloitte is the norm when undertaking such reviews.  That is, it is a reasonable standard to expect that both parties to the review would have the opportunity to comment and offer feedback for &quot;consideration&quot;, following which the independent reviewer has to decide on what will or will not be included in the final report, having taken into account the information and views of the parties to the review.  This is precisely what Deloitte undertook as an independent and reputable professional services firm.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding this, and given the gravity of the concerns expressed and the assertions contained in the provider's correspondence, I felt it important to seek written assurances from Deloitte as to its view of the assertions made.  I therefore wish to read into the record of the committee the following response received from Deloitte:<\/p><blockquote>In support of our findings in respect of part (b) of the TORs (our analysis of the funding provided by the HSE to the service provider from 2009 to 2015), our report includes the detail of the amounts initially reported by HSE to the PAC in respect of funding provided over the period adjusted for funding for one-off and new services which shows the real reduction in funding for like for like services over the period and is consistent with what was in the draft report.<br \/><br \/>There was an additional table (table 3.3) in the draft report which further adjusted the funding received for the shortfall determined under section (a) of the TORs.<br \/><br \/>We determined that further adjusting the table for this shortfall was confusing and could be misleading as the report already clearly set out the shortfall related to part (a) of our TOR.  The removal of this table was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.<br \/><br \/>As the report was prepared for the HSE, we considered it appropriate that additional information be included in the report which provided the HSE's context to our findings.  It is not uncommon in such reports to obtain responses to findings from those subject to the review and the report clearly sets out that this information was provided by the HSE and not subject to independent review by Deloitte.<br \/><br \/>It was not in our TOR to conclude as to whether the shortfall in the funding for Grace was effectively an additional cut in funding to the body or deliberately done because of the whistleblowing, this is a matter for the Commission of Investigation.<\/blockquote> <p>Having regard to the above response from Deloitte, I wish to address concerns raised regarding material - in this instance, tables relating to financial data - being in the draft report for consideration as distinct from the final report issued by the independent reviewer, Deloitte.  As I have referenced in terms of Deloitte's correspondence, the information that was contained in table 3.3 of the draft report had already been dealt with in the report and was removed to avoid confusion.  The removal of this table was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.<\/p><p>In its final report, Deloitte reproduced the table of figures provided by me in my opening statement to the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February last year.  These figures were subsequently disputed by the provider.  The Deloitte report at 6.4, page 17, states the following on these figures:<\/p><blockquote>From our analysis of the breakdown of the funding provided by the HSE to the Service Provider, we are satisfied that the figures set out in Table [6.1] above are in respect of total funding.&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>The report further states at 6.5, page 17:<\/p><blockquote>The Service Provider has advised us that whilst there was an overall 18% increase in the level of funding in 2015 compared with 2014, this increase is after the provision of new services.<\/blockquote><p>I take from this that the figures as presented by the HSE to this committee in February 2016 were correct.<br\/><br\/>I have accepted the final report as issued to me by Deloitte.  I remain of the view that the evidence in this report indicates the service provider was treated fairly in comparison with other similar service providers in the period under review.  I am satisfied, based on assurances from Deloitte, that any adjustment between the draft report of May 2017 and the final report was not as a result of any pressure from the HSE.  It is also my view that any remaining concerns should be dealt with through the Farrelly commission, which is established in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1509004800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Deputy Sean Fleming resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane has indicated his wish to speak.

Will Mr. O'Brien explain to this committee how he can put in writing to us his view or contention that the service provider was not treated unfairly?

Maybe Mr. O'Brien should correct the record of the committee and confirm that only the commission of investigation will make the determination, and it may influence whether the providers get an apology.

Again, before this committee in 2016, I indicated that in relation to those persons who had been harmed and were the subject of the Devine review, the executive - the HSE - would take a particularly positive approach to ensuring that appropriate restitution-compensation was paid for the failings in care, and the consequences of failings in care, in the south east, related not just to Grace but to a number of people.  Consequently, the approach to this case was not a hostile defensive approach but one, working with the State Claims Agency, which sought to put to right all of the issues regarding the deficiencies in the care that had led to the harm suffered by this person.  Consequently, it was right that the person would be provided with restitution which also would compensate the person for the cost of the care the person had received.

As we approach the flu season, it is important that those in the at risk groups - health care workers and those among the elderly population - avail of the flu vaccine.  There has been some controversy this week about whether it is exactly the right match.  The truth is that it is never exactly the right match, but the flu vaccine confers protection.  It can reduce the number of hospital admissions among the elderly, in particular, by between 50% and 60% and also reduce the number of deaths among those who contract the flu by up to 80%.  Therefore, there is a real and fundamental benefit both for the individual and our society.  I am very happy that this place of employment facilitates everyone who works in it through ease of access to the flu vaccine and hope other employers will also do so.

It is timely and important in ensuring the effective spending of public moneys in a way that will provide maximum benefit for those who use the services of the agencies involved.  <\/p><p>Mr. O'Brien, director general of the HSE, is joined in this session by Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer and deputy director general; Ms Rosarii Mannion, national director, human resources; Mr. John Cregan, head of compliance; Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary affairs division; Mr. Kevin Cleary, HSE compliance division, and Mr. Michael Flynn, national director, internal audit division.  We are also joined from the Department of Health by Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary general, and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Mr. Barry O'Brien and Mr. Tom Clarke.  <\/p><p>By virtue of 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Before I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement, I point out that it is almost 11.50 a.m. and that there will be block voting in the D&aacute;il in approximately one hour when we will have to suspend the sitting.  It is inevitable we will have to resume afterwards as we will certainly not have our business transacted within the next hour.  I am putting people on notice that we will be back after the block voting and a lunch break.  <\/p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor general to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#R00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":527,"content":"<p>The HSE funds over 2,270 service providers to deliver services on its behalf, as provided for in sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The service providers include large acute hospitals, as well as services for people with a disability and older persons.  They provide mental health, social inclusion, palliative care, primary care and health and well-being services.  The funding to pay for these services is allocated to HSE annually from the health Vote.  In 2016, &euro;3.8 billion, or around 28% of the HSE's Vote, was for the provision of payments to agencies.  It included a sum of &euro;2 billion to be shared between 16 acute hospitals and a sum of &euro;1.8 billion for voluntary and community groups.<\/p><p> Chapter 19 of the report on the accounts of public services for 2016 examines the HSE's framework for monitoring grants to service providers, drawing on the results of the audit of the financial statements of the HSE for 2016.  The current grant funding system has evolved from a long established model of service provision, whereby the State relies substantially on the voluntary sector to provide certain health services.  The formal arrangements with service providers are usually put in place by negotiation rather than through competitive processes.  The HSE has two types of contractual arrangement with service providers, depending of the level of funding provided.  Service arrangements are put in place with larger service providers, those operating on a for-profit basis and out-of-State service providers.  In 2016 approximately 570 agencies in receipt of &euro;3.75 billion were managed under these arrangements.  Grant aid agreements are put in place with service providers in receipt of funding below &euro;250,000 a year.  Approximately 1,700 agencies in receipt of just over &euro;32 million were managed under these arrangements in 2016.<\/p><p> The HSE has established a complex framework for the monitoring and oversight of these arrangements that is currently administered and overseen by nine community health care organisations, referred to as CHOs, located around the country and by six of the seven hospital groups, as summarised in Figure 19.1 of my report.  Progress has been made by the HSE in putting in place a systematic process for the oversight and monitoring of grant funded service providers.  However, the has report found that specified procedures within the HSE's monitoring framework were not applied consistently.  For example, funding CHOs did not have details of all of the key governance arrangements for a sample of service providers examined.  A service provider with multiple locations can receive funding from more than one of the HSE's CHOs and be subject to separate monitoring by each funding CHO.  The examination found that in these circumstances the identification of responsibilities in the HSE for monitoring and oversight was difficult.  The results of various audits and external reviews and compliance statements made by service providers highlight a number of governance issues arising across the sector, in particular non-compliance with procurement rules and regulations, non-compliance with public sector pay polices and the absence of internal audit functions.  Service agreements specify key performance indicators and reporting frequency.  Required key performance indicator returns were on file in just over half of the sample cases examined, of which over one quarter were not at the frequency specified in the service arrangement.  In the sample cases examined required audited financial statements had not been provided for the funding CHO in just under one quarter of service arrangements and grant aid agreements.<\/p><p> The report makes a number of recommendations in regard to the HSE's framework for oversight and monitoring, including that the HSE be satisfied that service providers have appropriate governance structures in place; that the service arrangements clearly set out key performance indicators and associated monitoring arrangements, including the responsibilities of both parties; that the monitoring arrangements specified in the service arrangements be complied with; and that the roles and responsibilities for monitoring be clearer where a service provider receives funding from more than one CHO.  The HSE has indicated that it accepted all of the recommendations made.  The director general will be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Before I call Mr. O'Brien, perhaps Mr. McCarthy might explain the phrase \"service arrangements are put in place with larger service providers, those operating on a for-profit basis and out-of-State service providers\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#S00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Do you mean out-of-State service providers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Yes.

The Chairman has introduced my team.<\/p> <p>  The HSE previously acknowledged that it had concerns about aspects of the monitoring and oversight arrangements for the grants paid to outside agencies.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is, therefore, timely and will further assist the HSE in ensuring both the HSE managers responsible for the oversight and monitoring of grants and the agencies in receipt of them will continue to work towards a comprehensive and effective oversight process.  The HSE has provided a briefing paper for the committee which describes the overall governance system in place for the management of the relationship with funded agencies and outlines the various elements introduced to ensure greater accountability and compliance with public sector norms.<\/p> <p>  The HSE's relationship with the voluntary sector should not be framed in purely negative terms.  I highlight the valuable role the sector plays in the delivery and development of health and personal social services.  The HSE funds 2,279 section 38 and section 39 agencies.  The reality is that the State depends on the voluntary sector for the delivery of many services and voluntary organisations are often the first to identify gaps in services.  At this stage, the agencies accept that expenditure of public funds and, just as importantly for their reputations, other charitable funds will attract greater scrutiny by the funder and the public at large.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's audit shows that there is adequate specification of outputs, that is, that the HSE is clear on what it expects in terms of the quantum and quality of services for the grant to be paid, but that some further work is required on other aspects of the oversight system.<\/p> <p>  The audit report speaks for itself regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the HSE's approach and performance.  I do not propose, therefore, to recite the detail of the report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has made three recommendations: the need for the HSE to include an assessment of the effectiveness of governance structures in its monitoring procedures; a need to highlight responsibilities for the monitoring of key performance indicators; and a need for compliance with the monitoring arrangements specified in service arrangements.  These recommendations are agreed to and progress on their implementation is being made.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges that the annual compliance statement process, the external governance reviews commissioned by the HSE, the HSE internal audits and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this examination and previous audits all point towards a number of governance issues arising across the sector, in particular non-compliance with procurement rules and regulations, non-compliance with public sector pay policies and the absence of internal audit functions.<\/p><p>To address these governance issues, the HSE has taken steps to enable agencies to have greater access to the HSE procurement systems and has provided training and guidance to external agency staff.  The executive has also taken steps to maintain the focus on compliance with public sector pay policy by all agencies and it will continue to subject agencies to greater scrutiny, in particular, through the HSE's national HR processes.  The HSE has also taken steps to emphasise a requirement for the establishment of an appropriate internal audit function, or the accessing of internal audit resources, as set down in the service arrangement.<br\/><br\/>There has been significant progress in effectively overseeing and monitoring the payment of grants, and compliance levels by agencies have improved.  The HSE will continue to develop its systems and it will, for example, establish contract management support units in the community health care organisations, CHOs, to ensure that matters such as the recommended frequency of monitoring meetings is met in all cases and that the oversight of multi-agreement agencies is co-ordinated.<br\/><br\/>The HSE will also further develop its IT system to streamline the oversight and monitoring administrative processes.  However, irrespective of how sophisticated and extensive the HSE systems are, the HSE cannot guarantee that every agency it funds will meet all its obligations.  In the past, the challenges faced by the sector <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the HSE are rooted in governance issues.  Good governance is fundamental to the effective delivery of services and the sustainability of agencies.  The HSE is not, and does not wish to be, the regulator for the sector and neither does the HSE wish to micromanage external agencies.  The HSE, like all public funders relies, and must be able to rely, on agencies' audited accounts.  The importance of a robust statutory external audit process cannot be overestimated.  Like all public funders, the HSE cannot audit all agencies as that would require an army of auditors.  While agencies should be accountable for the grants made available to them, they should continue to be independent and they should not be so constrained that the innovation and drive they bring to services is lost.<br\/><br\/>Once again, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and I can confirm that the HSE is working to implement the recommendations made and address the concerns identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#S02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

It remains the case that what the internal auditors found was the flagrant misuse of charitably given funds, not HSE funds.  That went right to the heart of the honesty of the HSE's relationship with that organisation, which meant that it could no longer have such a relationship.  That does have generalisable lessons, to use the phrase I used at the time, which does affect the way both internal audit, management and the compliance unit relate to those types of organisations.<\/p> <p>  On the other issues, on a quarterly basis the national director for internal audit presents a report at the national leadership team meeting of the HSE which covers all the audits concluded in that period, with a summary of all the findings, graded by classification.

That is what I want to establish.<\/p> <p>  There is a table on the screen which shows the 19 audited reports which framed the basis of the previous table which generalised the areas of concern.  The types of issues identified by internal audit are a high number of bank accounts, incomplete accounting records, transactions not authorised at appropriate levels, expenditure on gifts and entertainment, poor audit trails over credit card expenditure, absence of policies and procedure regarding conflicts of interest of board members and confidential disclosures, board members not completing Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, returns, salary payments in excess of the Department of Expenditure and Public Reform pay scales, senior staff in receipt of allowances and round-sum payments, staff in receipt of bonus payments, procurement issues including contracts awarded without competitive procurement processes, and documentary evidence not retained for the awarding of contracts.

I ask the Chairman to indicate when I have three minutes remaining as I wish to address a couple of issues.<\/p> <p>  We cannot throw all of these organisations under a bus because we need the services that some of them provide.  At the same time, we are in a pitiful position in terms of providing the level of oversight that would give members of the public the peace of mind they are entitled to in respect of expenditure of &euro;4 billion per annum, which a substantial sum of money.  If we continue with a process that is, by consensus, insufficient, with Mr. Flynn completing 19 or 20 audits each year, it will take us 113 years to get through all these organisations.  The HSE has provided a useful table setting out the audits carried out on 19 organisations, which shows that multiple breaches were recorded in three or more areas in almost 65% of audits.  It stands to reason that there is a very serious problem with governance and, potentially, misappropriation of funds in at least some organisations which have been designed to feather the nests of individuals.<\/p> <p>  This is a matter of grave concern, which requires a wholesale investigation.  I mean no disrespect to the witnesses but it appears the HSE is not capable of carrying out such an investigation.  An army may well be required to do this given the public interest involved, the &euro;4 billion at stake with the percentage of breaches emerging each year.  Last year, the examination carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General made similar findings.  I spent two years locked in a room adjacent to this one discussing banking.  This sounds similar to the Central Bank light touch approach which involves learning and teaching rather than imposing sanctions.  This approach does not serve us well, as we saw in the difficulties with tracker mortgages this week.  We, and those who come after us, will spend the next 113 years identifying the same difficulties.  With respect, the Department of Health and Minister must scope out what needs to be done to adequately manage these organisations and have an appropriate system in place.

I have a few questions, Deputy Connolly may wish to speak again and Deputy Murphy may have some final questions.  I will address the audit side.  In the HSE's annual report and financial statement for 2016, the section dealing with the directorate members' report is on page 135 and it addresses the membership of the audit committee.  The following individuals are members of the audit committee: Mr. Peter Cross, from the private sector, who is the chairman; Mr. Joe Mooney, former principal officer in the Department of Finance; Mr. John Hynes, former Secretary General of the then Department of Social Protection; Mr. David Smith, principal officer in the Department of Health; Mr. Stephen McGovern from CRH; Dr. Sheelah Ryan, public health physician and former CEO of HSE West; Professor Patricia Barker, chartered accountant, director of Tallaght hospital and former vice president of academic affairs in DCU; and Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, the HSE's national director of mental health.<\/p> <p>  To summarise that, there are two HSE staff or former staff, three current or former civil servants and three from outside the HSE.  The HSE's audit committee is for all of the HSE and not just section 38 and 39 bodies.  The HSE has a throughput of &euro;14 billion or &euro;15 billion per annum.  There are only three non-HSE or current civil servants on the audit committee.  Why is the number so low?  Is that in legislation?  Such a big organisation would benefit from having a majority of its members not being current or former public servants or people immediately connected with the HSE.  I do not get it.

The directorate by its nature comprises full-time HSE officials.  That is how it is composed.  The balance comprises persons considered by the directorate - which has the statutory responsibility to appoint the audit committee on my recommendation, as it happens - to have significant relevant experience.  Given the particular issues that arise for a body in the public sector at the time when this committee was established - it has been refreshed, and there have been some significant changes since this particular report - I believed it was of benefit to have persons who had served as Accounting Officers in the public system, hence the couple of people who were formerly Secretaries General.  However, the chair has no public sector experience and, as the Chairman has identified, there are a number of other members with very significant broadly based experience in the area of accounting, including a senior person from CRH.  It was the balance of competencies and experience and a particular ability to understand the complexities that arise in public sector accounting and the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of this committee as distinct from normal private sector accounting.  I also took the view, given the nature of some of the discussions that have to be undertaken, that it would be valuable to have a person nominated to the committee by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, which accounts for the individual who at that point was a Department of Health civil servant.

As Mr. Cregan said, whether one does it centrally by the core of the HSE or centrally by one of the CHOs, preferably the one that is the lead CHO for that organisation, the issue is to do it once and to tell the rest of the organisation.  The vast bulk of our voluntary organisations are not big enough to extend beyond one of our nine CHOs, but some very definitely are and some potentially even extend to all of them.  That is just the nature of the business.<\/p><p>It is imperative for the more important parts of governance that the key relationship, which is covered in schedule 2, is between the local community health care organisation, CHO, and the local part of the service provider to ensure there is real governance across the service, regardless of what other tasks can be done centrally.  If a large service provider has only signed in seven of eight CHOs where it happens to operate in all of them, then it has not completed the process.

If the HSE can do it, the Department can do it.  The HSE probably had the facility of saying it was withholding 20% of funding until it got this.  While we are not suggesting any cut in public funding, the Department should just think about it.  I am not suggesting it.  I am saying it seems to have worked right across the health sector, which is &euro;4 billion of public expenditure for those organisations, and that principle seemed to have a good effect.  Nobody suggested there was any cut to organisations' funding but it did put pressure on them to do it.<\/p> <p>  A couple of years ago, the Committee of Public Accounts dealt with issues regarding the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, Rehab and St. John of God, as well as pay in different maternity and children's hospitals and executives not being paid in line with public sector pay policy.  On the face of it, the HSE seems to have come a long way since then.  Does Mr. O'Brien agree?  Could he make a brief comment from his perspective as chief executive?  What were the key ingredients?  Is it as good as it sounds?  Was it very difficult dealing with those organisations?  The HSE seems to be close to a reasonably satisfactory situation.  What were the lessons that should be learned for the public service?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#OO01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":995,"content":"<p>I should preface it by saying that it is a bit like the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  It will never be fully repainted and is an ongoing constant grind.  The work of our own internal audit committee and various HSE national directors, the contribution of the Committee of Public Accounts and the public response to some of the issues exposed in the CRC, which was a very different organisation then to the CRC of today, have changed the environment around compliance with policy and the appropriate use of public funds.  The Console affair also played into that to some extent.  The HSE has put in place additional procedures to help move things along but I do not think there will ever be room for complacency.

We put in Mr. Cregan and put in place a process through board match to re-establish it as an independently managed organisation.  It has made great strides and it is interesting that it is currently being considered for a good governance award.  What it proves to me is that where at times we may have to take quite a heavy approach, force changes of personnel and so on, there is great value in many of these organisations and our approach must be one that protects the services they provide, while dealing with the governance deficits that exists.  That has been at the core of our philosophy as we approach this.  It is at the core of what we are doing now.  The overall environment has changed but our purpose continues to be to protect the service while dealing with the governance deficits and not throwing the baby out with the bath water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#OO01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":998,"content":"<p>One other element that might be significant is the requirement to disclose the chief executive's remuneration package in financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#OO01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1509004800,"counter":999,"content":"<p>Could Mr. McCarthy say that again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017102600002#OO01500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1509004800,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>It is the requirement on bodies to report the remuneration package paid to the chief executive in their audited annual financial statements.
