Prior to that, I had operated as campus manager since December 2013.  Due to legislation enacted in June 2016, the campus, as it currently exists, has only come into effect.  Prior to that, there were three detention schools on the Oberstown site, Oberstown Boys, Oberstown Girls and Trinity House, which were run as three separate entities.  They had different structures, focus on young people and policies.  A significant change process has been under way since 2011 which has culminated in the development of the Oberstown detention school which is one entity.<\/p> <p>  In January 2014, I met two members of staff on the campus who had known each other before.  One had worked in one school; the other in another school.  For 12 years, they came in and went out the front gate to work but did not know each other.  This gives the context of the challenges experienced in Oberstown over the past several years.  Today, those two individuals have different roles but work side by side, part and parcel of the integrated schools.<\/p> <p>  In December 2013, the number of staff employed on the campus was 198; now 261 are employed.  A &euro;56 million project has seen the development of an entire new facility.  The idea was to expand the number of young people on the campus.  Originally, there were 24 young people in Oberstown and 16 in Trinity House when I arrived.  The new campus has a 90-bed capacity.  However, the ability to provide 90 places for young people depends on the number of staff available, as well as routine and structure.  The campus now has a licence for 48 boys and six girls, compared to 40 in March 2015.  We have taken 17 year olds on remand.  Over the past several years, there has been a focus on ensuring young people did not go to prison.  In 2012, the focus was to first remove 16 year olds from St. Patrick's Institution.  This has been achieved.  There were challenges in taking in this cohort on the campus but they are part and parcel of the group we now cater for in Oberstown.  The next phase was to take the 17 to 18 year old cohort which was divided into two strategies.  The first was to take the young people on remand which was completed last year.<\/p><p>We are still in the process of finalising taking young people on committal.  That completes the agenda for removing young people from adult prison.  That is important.  That was the focus of my task when I took on the role some years ago, to address the merger and expansion, to modernise the campus and bring it in line with best practice from a care perspective.  There have been multiple challenges.  We have met many of those and have much more to do.  We have industrial relations challenges and challenges in respect of integration policies.  These are all part and parcel of a change process that is under way.<\/p><p> We have implemented an ethos on care, education, health and well-being, offending behaviour and planning for discharge of young people, CEHOP.  Part of our challenge was to bring together the ethos of different schools.  There was a perception at Trinity House that it dealt with high-risk young people from a secure perspective.  Oberstown Boys was seen as a relationship model where there was not a high fence and children absconded and left the buildings more regularly and there was Oberstown Girls.  We have had to bring together those three schools, with three focuses and three different teams to create a common approach.  That has its own challenges with people hanging on to the way they used to do business.  We are moving on that, we have a framework, we are doing training with staff but the key challenge is to balance the issue of how to care for young people in a detention facility while ensuring they stay within the facility and receive the appropriate level of care.  These are the ongoing challenges on the campus.  I will hold it there and I am happy to take any questions people may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Bergin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the request from Deputy Rabbitte to hold this meeting today.

From talking to staff members working at Oberstown it appears to me that morale among them is very low and this is rooted in staff discontent with Mr. Bergin's leadership style.  Is Mr. Bergin aware of these concerns about his management style and those of other senior managers?  I have spoken to staff who have little faith in Mr. Bergin's leadership of Oberstown and the concerns they have expressed to me include a breakdown of trust between senior management and staff, a complete absence of communication with staff and a dictatorial style of management which does not seek to engage staff, particularly on the part of Mr. Bergin, and a general lack of respect for staff.  I have been informed that up to 100 staff members, including union and non-union members and all staff grades, including middle managers, held a meeting in Balbriggan last Wednesday evening.  At this meeting a motion that staff had no confidence in Mr. Bergin was passed by an overwhelming majority of attendees.

It was my request that they attend this meeting.  The background to that request is that I am not long in this position but since taking on the role of spokesperson for children and youth affairs for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party I have been inundated, week in and week out with commentary on Oberstown.  This repeats commentary received by my predecessor, Deputy Troy, the previous year.  I can totally understand that it takes time to bed down a situation and to bring together the three different houses Mr. Bergin talks about but all the while I assume we would have been learning through the whole process.<\/p> <p>  This summer, however, seems to have been particularly bad, maybe only because I am new to this.  Children have got onto a roof, there have been fires and rooms closed down repeatedly.  There are nine units but four are now closed.  We talk about capacity and the ability to care and to protect staff, children and management.  I am trying to understand the environment, which is supposed to involve rehabilitation and that is why these children are in that unit.  That is the style and model for that unit but to my untrained eye there is no sense that the management, staff and children are working in a safe, comfortable and rehabilitative environment.  That is not good practice.  <\/p> <p>  The fundamental key to help the children in the rehabilitation programme is education.  How many hours do they attend daily in education?  I am concerned about there being one girl on the campus.  I have concerns about the risk factors for staff and children and what we are doing to prevent a serious accident occurring.  I thought it could not get any worse, when I heard a room had been closed down, then I heard they were on the roof, that there was a fire, the kitchen was taken over and there was scalding water, cups were broken and that some of the children are more in control than the staff.  That raises serious questions.  I have been raising the question of Oberstown since last June.  I do not like making media headlines out of something that I am not totally involved in but I am posing those questions out of genuine concern for the children and the staff who are trying to deliver a programme.  I would appreciate anything Mr. Bergin can tell me on that.  I will probably will raise more questions later.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#B00400","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in.  The first two questioners have got to the root of some of the difficult issues facing everybody involved in Oberstown.  Mr. Bergin told us the staff numbers have increased, that three schools came together.  I presume there were different operational cultures in the three schools.  Could Mr. Bergin give us some insight into the difficulties surrounding that and whether there were different practices that had to be re-learned or changed?  The maximum number in the legislation is 48 boys and six girls.  Mr. Bergin has told us that is the current number or maybe I am wrong.  Can Mr. Bergin clarify that?  Deputy Rabbitte said there is one girl.  At the time of the incident there were 41 present.

Mr. Bergin gave us a lot of documentation on the protocols and what to do about separation, which was very useful and we all had an opportunity to read it because we got it in advance.  It is obviously very difficult for everybody, staff, management and young people, to make this system work but the literature shows that the best way to do that is through what is called routine relationship building.  The impression we are getting is that there may not be good relationships.  Can Mr. Bergin give us a better understanding of the challenges?  We have all heard some of the staff perspectives and they feel that they are not protected.<\/p><p>They feel they are subject to a lot of very challenging behaviour yet if one reads the protocols, it looks like there are good protocols in place.  I would like to know a little more about whether they are working or whether they look good on paper but in practice are not working.  <\/p><p> I was also going to ask about education.  Education can make the difference between a young person having a positive future or not.  Deputy Rabbitte has already asked about it.  I know from reading that there are a significant number of hours per day available in terms of education but do the young people actually attend?  <\/p><p> I have one more practical question on the 17 year olds.

I will address some of the common questions on education.  The school on the campus has in excess of 26 teachers.  Those 26 teachers are employed by the Education and Training Board, ETB, which comes under the Department of Education and Skills.  The school on the campus is its own entity and has its own structure.  The school on the campus, which is no different from the residential side of the house, had to undergo a merger on the campus last September.  Previously there were two schools - Oberstown Boys School and Trinity House School.  There were two teaching teams coming together under one new structure.  In September 2015, that new school was formed and a principal was appointed who had been on site previously.  He brought together all the teachers in a new building on the campus.  Some of the teachers there operate in the primary school structure and some in the secondary school.  However, the school year is a primary school year and not secondary.  Class hours are based on primary school.  The class year is based on primary school so it runs later into the year.  The school structure is that in a classroom there is one teacher per three children.  That is the standard and how the classroom is designed.<\/p> <p>  I will return to the education question but from a physical perspective, it is the most modern school I have ever come across.  It has everything for teaching children.  It has electronic boards, academic classrooms, training, computers, maintenance and woodwork - anything one could think of is available and provided to young people.  The facilities and structures are there and it has been well-resourced.  The issue is providing education to up to 48 young people in that facility.  There is a routine for moving children to and back from school.  School kicks off at 9.45 a.m. and finishes at 3.20 p.m.  There are 48 young people to be moved in and out of school twice a day.  It is structured so that 48 young people are not wandering around the campus at the same time.  They are moved in groups of three and four.  It takes 15 minutes in the morning to move all young people to school and it takes 15 minutes in the evening to move them all back out of school.  When they are in school, they are in their own classrooms.  It is a standard primary school day.  There are times in the morning when it is slower to move them in.  One cannot have 48 young people wandering around the campus.  It is a practical issue and it is done from a security perspective.  The only time young people do not attend school is if there is a problem with them in school.  If there is a problem with their behaviour in school, they manage it in school.  However, if they need to step out of school, they are sent back to the units.  If someone is not managing in the unit, for example, if we have a new admission, a young person who is on drugs or there is a serious concern about their behaviour, they may not attend school   The majority of young people go to school on a daily basis, whether they are 15, 16 or 17.  The young people love to go to school.  They want to go to school.  There is a perception that they are not getting enough of school and they would like to be there more.  What we have done from a campus perspective is employ nine people to come in in the evening between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock to provide further classes in music, reading, drama and sports.  We have an extra nine staff coming in and from 4 o'clock to 7 o'clock in the evening there are further classes available for young people.  It is done in a structured way within campus resources.  <\/p> <p>  I gave some examples on the schooling and the results that were achieved in the junior certificate, which is a standard output - 20 young people achieved their junior certificate and different exams.  This needs to be understood in the context of the fact that of the 48 young people on licence in the campus, 20 of them are on committals.  All the others are on remand and come and go so they will not be in a position to sit the exams.  Almost 100% of young people who are in a position to sit exams are sitting exams, gaining a level of academic achievement and moving on.  For those on remand, there is a whole other process of accredited modules that they can carry out of the school.  If they are in the school for three, four or five weeks, the school focuses on a different approach to education.  That helps them when they move on.  From an education perspective, we constantly review the attendance of children in school to make sure it is at a maximum.  We are well on our way to having that achieved.  From the education perspective, I am very happy with where we got to.  <\/p> <p>  I will address the point about relationships and the ethos of the campus.  After my arrival, I wandered the schools for a couple of months to see what was going on.  I will give an example of some of the challenges we had which we have had to try to overcome.  If I was a young person in one of the schools and I was on mobilities, which means I was allowed to leave the campus with staff or on my own and could go out for the weekend and go home, if I came back to the unit and had to go to court for an appearance a week later I would be handcuffed, put into a car with three staff and taken to court.  That does not make sense to me.  I give permission for a young person who is managing well to go home for a weekend, to get on the bus themselves, come back themselves and manage well at home but because of a need to attend court to address previous issues, they are handcuffed and taken to court.  That was a cultural practice.  If a child was in another school, they might not be handcuffed but thrown into the back of a car with one staff member and taken off to court.  There are real challenges around how the cultural practices of the school evolved over a period of time.  It is an ongoing concern.  I do not want to give the impression I am coming down on staff on this issue.  This is reality.  It is how the schools had evolved up to a particular point in time.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of ethos was referenced.  The outside world perceived that Trinity House dealt with the more difficult young people.  On that basis, the routine and regime within Trinity House was based around security.  When one came in, it was a lot stricter.  The buildings were designed in such a way that a child did not come out of the buildings.  If they did they were in handcuffs.  All the services were built around the school whereas in Oberstown the units were scattered around the grounds and there was not the same level of security.  The control that staff had on young people was based around relationships.  If I work with young people in a way that is based around relationships, I might get into conflict with a staff member who works with young people in a way that is based around processes, security and control because we both come from different perspectives.  <\/p> <p>  Young people have asked to be placed in different schools.  If they were in court, they would tell the judge they wanted to go to Oberstown Boys School or Trinity House because they had a knowledge and understanding of the routine.  They were picking what suited them best.  That continued up to 1 June 2016.  For the length of time I have been there, I have not been in a position to determine what children go to what school because the legislation provided that the courts decided what child would go to what school if there was a bed available.  Those schools have been gone since 1 June so now the director decides what unit anybody coming onto the campus goes to.<\/p><p>There is no such thing as Trinity House or Oberstown Boys School any more.  We have ten units.  Underneath the surface, I am concerned that there are still practices within certain units that relate to certain schools.  It is natural for staff to hang on to how they formerly did business.  This also applies to young people.  Some have been there for a year or for two years and they have perceptions of the Trinity House rules being in force.  I received a letter from a young person recently asking to be able to write to his friends in prison.  He was able to map out for me that there was one rule for Oberstown House and another for Trinity House.  He asked me what rule applied to him because the staff were giving him mixed messages.  The rule in one school was that one could not write to someone in prison because it was seen as encouraging young people to communicate with others involved in a criminal life.  That has moved on but it is still embedded in some of the practices of staff.  This might give an indication of some of the challenges that exist.<\/p><p> People spoke about strategy but the culture is embedded and if we do not get buy-in from staff on how we do our business, we will find it more difficult.  A pro-social focus on relationships was mentioned.  Looking at how things happened on the overall campus, I was concerned with the question of whether we were concerned with care or control.  How do we determine the relationship model we need to have with young people?  We did some research and got some external people in to help.  The challenge was in the fact that young people previously got two-year sentences.  The chances are that they would have worked with a group of people and staff who would get to know them, have relationships with them, take them off campus for golf or shopping or home to meet their parents, build up a relationship and then, after two years, move on.  They are not the young people who come to us now.  With changes in legislation and the focus on keeping young people out of detention facilities, sentences are shorter, typically of three, six or nine months.  Accordingly, the focus of staff has to change and they have to see how they can get to know a young person who is on remand for two or three weeks and on committal for another three or four months.  They cannot focus on dealing with them for two years and getting them an apprenticeship when they leave.  Their focus must be on how they can get them to see a doctor on the basis that they have core medical health issues that need to be addressed.  They need to think how they can get them to school and other basic stuff that will help them when they leave in three or four months' time.  Some staff have managed the change really well but others find it more difficult.  <\/p><p> I will try to walk committee members through the way a young person comes on to the campus.  We do not decide who comes onto the campus - the courts decide.  We get a phone call to say a remand order has been made for, say, Pat Bergin and that he is on his way.  We do not know who Pat Bergin is, however.  We start the process of gathering information from social services, probation services and family.  The young person will normally be on campus before we get the information.  We are at a loss before we start trying to understand him or her.  When the young person comes into the campus, he or she is searched and must give urine samples.  He or she is put into a room and monitored and then he or she is allowed to mix with the rest of the campus.  We are a detention facility, not a residential unit, and that raises its own challenges.  If that has to be the experience of children at the outset, I want to soften it.  We still have to search them and test them for drugs and we still need to have information but it does not have to be done in a protection room with very little light.  We are trying to change the culture so that we do business in a different way.  In this way, the care element comes out from the beginning and it is less like a detention facility.<\/p><p> Staff are fearful at the moment.  Events of 29 August have had a serious impact on us all at the campus.  It was a long 12 hours but the fire was not the issue.  The media spoke about the fire and the people on the roof but the young people were on another roof in the building and there was no risk to them.  They set a fire and moved elsewhere.  The issue was the lack of control the young people demonstrated and that is what has scared staff.  Many factors contributed to that and there is a Garda investigation into the events of that night, including into the damage caused and the fire.  The question for me concerns what contributed to the events of 29 August.  There was a range of factors, including industrial action, minimum staff and disquiet over a number of issues.  Young people were aware that there was industrial action so they were empowered and knew that, outside the door, there were only two staff instead of the three or four who should have been there.  Anxiety over how people were going to manage was a real concern for staff.  There were questions of who was going to be on that morning and how they would be deployed.  It was a difficult period and what happened on the day escalated to a point that we needed assistance.  The fire services were called in, as were garda&iacute;, to try to regain control.  The fire happened at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. but events had been ongoing since noon and that was the core concern.  The issue is the fear and anxiety staff have had over how they can lose control and we are trying to address that.<\/p><p> I was asked about how control was lost in this way.  In any unit there are a maximum of eight young people and 15 staff assigned to it.  From 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. those 15 staff are on a rota to provide direct care to young people.  They can be on at 3 a.m., 4 p.m., 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. - it all depends on the roster.  When there are 15 staff per unit, 12 will be available and three may be on leave.  In all units we have 125 staff and the challenge is that the level of sick leave always has been quite high.  Last November we had sick leave of 17% and this was a routine figure over the years.  We have reduced it to 10% by managing people's return.  There were people on our books who were never going to come back so we needed to backfill posts.  When I started in December 2013, there were 24 staff not on campus who were either out sick or absent for some other reason.  That is why a unit that was supposed to be in use at that stage was not opened.  We ascertained whether the staff who were absent were coming back and started a recruitment process.  Members will see from the figures that an enormous amount of recruitment has been made, with numbers going from 198 to 261.  Some of it was to backfill posts for people who had left or retired.  The capacity to increase staff is based on a very small pool of social care workers who exist in the outside world.  There is a challenge for any residential centre - not just Oberstown - in getting staff as there is a small pool.  The negative publicity around Oberstown does not help and people have signed up for us only to pull back.  If we do not have sufficient staff we cannot provide the service we need to provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Bergin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but I have to keep the meeting moving, though I appreciate Mr. Bergin may not have given all his answers.

The general commentary has been dealt with so I will proceed directly to specific questions.  My first question is referred to in the director's own notes and briefing document.  It states that 86% of residents are on remand.  Is this too high and are there other facilities which might be more suitable?  How long are people staying there on remand generally?<\/p> <p>  A number of comments have been made on the confidence and morale of staff.  Certainly from speaking to staff, I am aware that a particular issue for many of them seems to be training and a feeling that there is no adequate training or provision for it.  In that context, I note from the director's briefing note that night supervision officers do not require academic qualifications.  Given that they are likely to be dealing with very difficult and challenging circumstances and incidents, is that appropriate?  In addition, the management of actual or potential aggression, MAPA, course appears to be just a one-day course.  Can that be clarified?  I imagine that is not accurate.<\/p> <p>  I note the Estimates briefing which we will be dealing with in the next session sets out a fair deal of commentary on staffing.  The witnesses were speaking about the difficulty of building a relationship with children from the point of view that they are in there for longer periods.  There seems to be a very considerable reliance, however, on agency staff.  Obviously, that is a difficulty in terms of the ability of staff to build rapports and trust and relationships.  What is the ratio of full-time to agency staff?<\/p> <p>  On the number of incidents, approximately 88 were recorded in the past nine months.  That amounts to approximately one incident every three days for that period.  Given the number of children involved and some of the challenging behaviours that might present themselves in a facility such as this, the number of incidents seems lower than I might have imagined in some respects.  What qualifies as an incident?  What is reported as an incident?  Is everything recorded?  Does management ever direct staff not to contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the case of an incident, regardless of seriousness?  Are all calls to the Garda required to be authorised by management?  Does management ever turn garda&iacute; away after they have been summoned to the facility by a phone call in any circumstance?  Would management ever overrule a risk assessment made by a staff member and in what circumstances might it do so?  How would that proceed?<\/p> <p>  Have staff ever been warned about taking too many sick days?  Are there penalties involved and, if so, what are they?  Have staff ever been threatened with half pay in the event of taking too many sick days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#E00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming along.

If that is the case, there are individuals who will determine what they deem to be a crisis and who will engage constantly with the Garda.  We have management on site all the time if an issue arises.  The Garda is not going to come in and do our jobs for us.  It is not responsible for the day-to-day operations of the campus.  That is very clear.  We have ongoing discussions and engagement with the Garda around this.  If an offence has been committed, it is for the Garda to investigate and process, but it is not for it to come in very quickly.  Historically, if issues arose where a young person would not go to bed and was causing a problem on the campus, local garda&iacute; were contacted and came down.  They stood behind the staff and the young fellow went to bed.  That cannot be the practice on the campus.<\/p><p>It cannot happen.<\/p><p> We are very clear that it is a requirement for the Garda to come onto the campus to provide assistance.  In the event of something happening similar to what happened on 29 August, that call will be made, but it is made at a very senior level based on the level of risk that exists.  In terms of the day-to-day operations, the staff, namely, the managers of the units need to manage the crisis.  They need to draw on all the resources across the campus to support that, but the Garda is not one of those supports.<\/p><p> Regarding risks, a risk assessment is undertaken and that is determined on the basis of people considering what factors are in place.  If somebody is not considering all the factors, of course a risk assessment will be overridden.  If somebody has not considered all the factors that need to be considered, a unit manager or whoever will input into that and identify that the person had not considered particular elements.  To give an example regarding risks, if it is required for a person to go to court and if three staff have been deemed necessary to bring that person to court, a member of management may look at that requirement and, having noted that the young person has gone home, might ask what the issue is and why three staff are required to bring that young person to court and might say that two should be sufficient.  However, the risk assessments that was undertaken by the staff might determine that three are required.  Risk assessments are only a tool to determine what actions need to be taken and if all factors have not been considered, managers will input into that process.<\/p><p> Regarding restorative justice, we have requested this and have been processing the campus as having a restorative practice.  We have done some training with staff and have been doing some work with young people to have restorative practice as part and parcel of the culture on the campus.  With respect to assessment from a mental health perspective, we have psychiatry on site.  The HSE provides us with a psychiatrist, Professor Harry Kennedy, every Wednesday and he is available as required.  All children coming onto the campus undertake a MAYSI assessment, which is a mental health assessment, and that is done on a weekly basis through a multidisciplinary approach.<\/p><p> On the question on the structure, each unit has 15 staff and one manager.  We have agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on our team leader process within that.  We are in discussions with the union about introducing that.  There was a co-ordinator post in the unit and it was voluntary, but that was withdrawn by the unions.  However, we have approval now to put in place a structure to support the managers and the staff from within their 15 staff and one manager.  Each unit operates on its own and they provide cross-cover depending on what is happening on a day-to-day basis.<\/p><p> Regarding assurances with respect to the challenges-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Bergin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>There were a few questions in that respect, including the figure of 86% being on remand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Remand is a core issue; it is a big issue for us.  The number of young people on remand is substantial.  The figures I would like to put out are that of all the young people who came through the campus for the first nine months, 19 were placed on committal orders.  The remainder of the young people who came in were on remand-turnover, and they create substantial challenges for us because they do not buy into the campus because they are on remand.  They hope to be gone from the campus next week or the week after, so they do not engage in the same way.  From our perspective, we would ask why young people are remanded.  A decision has been made by the courts that we are to hold young people for a period of time until a decision is made as to whether they are guilty or not guilty.  Regarding the figure of 86%, some of those young people may be found guilty and other sanctions may be put in place for them but they have been on remand with us for a length of time, so the experience of detention is not something that we would consider all of them would require.  There is a challenge with the system putting young people on remand with us for a period of time, and they could be long-term remands.  A remand could be for one week but it could be for five or six months, and that is a major challenge for us.  A bail supervision scheme is coming into operation in two to three weeks' time on the campus, which will allow young people who are on remand to get bail, possibly depending on the assessment, but the key problem is that those young people must be on remand to access the scheme.  However, the overall approach to young people being placed on remand in the campus is a worryingly increasing trend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Bergin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Were staff ever threatened over sick leave or were there penalties or warrants-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

We have gone through a very difficult scenario in the past five or six weeks, particularly following on from the fire.  Regarding the young people, it needs to be put in context.  What happened on the 29th involved eight young people.  There were another 31 young people on campus and they are well cared for, there was no issue with them, they did not get involved and did not want to be involved.  Their routines, their place in terms of planning and their education continues as normal and has continued as normal.  The challenge has been around a handful, a very particular number of young people, in terms of how they have been demonstrating and managing their behaviour.  There was a follow-on difficulty for staff because of the impact of those young people's behaviour on the campus and towards the staff.  It is important to put this in context.  We still have young people who are mobile - who go home for weekends and young people who are out and about going to school every day.  From a safety and security perspective, the five units, which are the new units down at the bottom of the campus, operate day by day and do their business that needs to be done.  People need to recognise that the young people we have on the campus are young people who have not managed in other scenarios.  They have been out in their communities, have been involved in the Garda diversion programmes and have committed offences, or are before the courts regarding offences.  These are young people who will demonstrate and display challenging behaviour.  That is the nature of the detention facility.  This is not a facility where particular children are put together because of specific needs.  We have not agreed that these children come to us; they are sent us by the court because of complex behaviours.  That is important to understand in that we then need to manage within that environment.<\/p> <p>  On my capacity to place children in different units so as to be able to separate them, I have young people on remand and young people on committal back being mixed together and that creates a significant problem.  In three weeks' time I hope to be able to separate those on remand from committals on the basis of the units that become available.  That is how I assure that young people on remand are dealt with in a particular way and young people on committal are dealt with in another way.  That other way is that they have an open type of unit where they are more free and they engage in their process, whereas with the young people on remand, we are focused on how we manage them on a day-by-day basis. <\/p> <p>  There is a significant number of resources including support for staff.  We have a system in place on campus in regard to stress.  With respect to young people, we have the ACTS team from Tusla on site, a medical health service on site, a general practitioner on site three days a week and a dentist on site.  We have an immense amount of resources and structures that help us provide for the day-to-day care of young people.  Our challenge - regardless of whether people want to accept this - is there is a real complexity around the change process that has been undertaken in Oberstown because of the historical way that business has been done.<\/p><p>For a long time the outside world did not come onto the campus.  We have taken down the fences and have said that the outside world needs to come in, that it needs to help us.  In doing that we are exposing what is going on in the campus.  However, I would prefer people to know what is going on in the campus and that we do it right rather than having a fence around the place and keeping the world out.  It is my approach and my management style, that if we need help we will bring people in to help us to provide the appropriate level of care for young people.  That is the determination and the focus I have with regard to the care of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#F02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Bergin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Before I bring in Professor Kilkelly there will be one quick supplementary question which Professor Kilkelly can address in her closing remarks, if the members can wait.

From a capacity perspective, and this links in to the question around staffing, the shortfall of 45 staff is for the extra units to open.  We are running six and seven units at the moment and we have the appropriate number of staff for that.  For three more units to open, an additional 15 staff are required per unit.

I have seen two things at first hand.  One is the extraordinary challenge which we have heard about this morning.  As somebody who has spent 20 years in this field I can testify to that challenge, across and around the world, in how we manage these kinds of facilities and the kind of work that has to go into them.  The second thing I have witnessed is an extraordinary ability to reflect, adapt, change and respond positively.  We must acknowledge the extraordinary work that is ongoing in Oberstown, from staff and from management, to ensure this is the best possible opportunity that young people sentenced to remand can receive.  A minor illustration of this relates to such things as agency staff.  Critical decisions have to be made around staffing the units properly where that staffing does not exist.  We have to take those kinds of difficult decisions when the time comes, and it is not what anybody would like, but we have to balance those issues as we go through.<\/p> <p>  I wish to reflect on the uniqueness of the board of management of Oberstown.  We have a very unique entity and form of governance that very firmly holds management to account but also supports the delivery of the objectives that Oberstown seeks to achieve on behalf of the State in the development and implementation of law and policy.  That is our core mission.  We have all the major stakeholders on our board.  I am chairman and we have local representatives, two nominees from staff and representation from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills and from Tusla.  In addition there are five members who are appointed through the public appointments system, bringing together very important expertise in governance, human resources, child law and finance.  We now have, for the first time, a unique but well-equipped board to deliver on the mission of Oberstown in holding management to account and ensuring everything is done to make this organisation a success. The unique nature of the entity should also provide reassurance in the level of oversight and the level of investment by individual board members.<\/p> <p>  We have not touched at all on the industrial relations processes.  This relates to the points that were made about the concerns of staff, the extent to which they are raised at board level, and the extent of engagement in the Workplace Relations Commission and other separate processes to hear the concerns of staff, address them directly and work with staff in acknowledging those concerns and, critically, how we respond while upholding the ethos that Oberstown represents.  It is much the easier and cheaper, as we all know, to imprison young people, but it is a failure on the part of the State.  What we are trying to do is much more ambitious.  We must leave no stone unturned in how we do that.  Having worked very closely with the management and staff and having been on the board the number of years I have been there, particularly as chairman, I am very confident that every opportunity is taken to do the right thing in the context of staff and in the context of providing the best possible service for young people with the best support we can provide.<\/p> <p>  Extraordinary strides have been made in the level of service that is provided in bringing the education and the vital health pieces together.<\/p><p>I am keen to make one comment in reflecting on recent months and the extent of the changes we have heard about.  It is clear that there are different views about the way Oberstown should be run, whether certain particular practices should continue, what policies should prevail and so on.  It will simplify matters.  It comes down to different emphases, whether on a security focus, a care focus or a welfare focus, and it is not a question of one or the other.  We have to provide care within a secure ethos and that is very challenging.  If we can do that, it will be a significant statement for Ireland.  My commitment is to do it.  In the international context, everyone recognises this as a challenge, an ambitious but laudable one.<\/p><p> I wish to reflect on the different views.  Having listened to staff directly, the unions - through the Workplace Relations Commission process - and the board, I came to the opinion that we needed a process which would provide an outside view of Oberstown.  The idea is that this view from outside would help us to empower staff, listen to the experiences of staff and the young people and to review and reflect on what we are doing.  In addition this perspective could provide expert input into our continued development.  That is the basis of the review that has been commissioned and which will be undertaken in the coming months.  It will be very much an inclusive supportive process for staff as well as one focused on the young people and their experiences.  The perspective of outsiders looking in, people with expertise in this area, should provide further assurance that we are doing everything we can to make this a success.<\/p><p> A point was made about what people see when they come to Oberstown.  I have been in and out of the facility many times.  In my experience, there are not two sides to this.  It is what it is.  Every access will be granted.  It is in no one's interests that we should in any way attempt to put forward only some kind of best view of it.  There is only one view and it is what will be on offer to the committee.  I am keen to welcome members to the campus to see the facility for themselves, to engage with staff and young people and to continue to ask questions.  I thank members for their continued support for Oberstown as a piece of work in the interests of the young people who are there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#G02900","nonspeaker":"Professor Ursula Kilkelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Kilkelly.

I am pleased to join the committee this morning to deal with issues relating to the Estimates for my Department and to discuss my plans for the future in the context of the programme for Government.  I welcome the opportunity to brief the committee on the key issues from my perspective.<\/p> <p>  Before I continue, I wish to extend an invitation to the committee to visit Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  I know members have had the opportunity for an exchange with both the chairperson and the director of Oberstown.  I hope the committee will agree that, despite recent challenges, we are on the right path.  I would be happy to return to this matter later if committee members wish.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the views of members on their priorities in terms of spending on children and young people.  The discussion should be a two-way process and it would be helpful for me to understand the issues members wish to advance.  Clearly, with a limited budget, choices must be made.<\/p> <p>  I will set out a little about the mid-year expenditure.  The 2016 provision for my Department's Vote totals &euro;1.117 billion.  This is made up of &euro;1.088 billion in current funding and &euro;29 million in capital.  The composition of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs Vote largely echoes the priority areas we will be discussing today.  The largest portion of the allocation, a sum of &euro;679 million, relates to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The next largest allocation of &euro;344 million relates to early childhood care and education scheme and the other early years schemes.  The Vote also contains smaller but no less important allocations that support a variety of programmes and services.  These include the youth sector, the Irish Youth Justice Service, research, the young person's policy framework, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the Adoption Authority or Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The mid-year expenditure position for the Vote shows an overall variation of &euro;8.41 million ahead of profile.  This over-profile position is largely attributable to timing issues, particularly in respect of Tusla.  The agency made a significant drawdown of some &euro;24 million in the last days of June, although the transaction was profiled for July expenditure.<\/p><p> At mid-year, the Tusla subhead was showing an expenditure outlay of &euro;4 million below profile.  As of the end of September, Tusla is showing an underspend of &euro;1 million.  The overall Tusla spend is currently largely on profile and I would expect that the full resource provision will be expended by the end of the year.  Any marginal overspend which might occur will be met from within the Vote - this a key message.<\/p><p> The other areas of the Vote continue to show expenditure variations to varying degrees, including some under-profile figures on the child care schemes.  Overall, however, I expect that the year-end position will see capacity within the Vote to meet any marginal overspend arising with no requirement for any Supplementary Estimate in 2016.<\/p><p> The expenditure details that I have just outlined set the context for my priorities in the future.  Since this Government took office on 6 May, we have been working on a challenging and ambitious agenda of development and reform.  I have had the opportunity to visit many services throughout the country, both statutory and non-statutory, and I am struck by the commitment, energy and, indeed, passion of all involved.<\/p><p> I am proud of the part that I played in negotiating A Programme for Partnership Government because of the nature and extent of its commitments about children, young people and families.  In all, there are some 32 specific commitments in the programme relating to my Department and I want to make swift progress in as many of them as I possibly can, as early as I can.<\/p><p> The commitments will also inform my Department's statement of strategy for the period 2016-19, which we are working on and hope to finalise by the end of this month.  As a framework for the specific commitments, my overall strategic objectives will be about having the right policies, legislation and resources in place to meet the particular needs of children, young people and families; making sure we have the right systems of support for all groups, whether they are vulnerable children in need of intervention by Tusla, systems like Meitheal, the family early intervention supports, child care supports for families throughout the country, or wider supports for children and families generally; supporting children and young people in active learning and participation in society, and taking a look at the systems, such as home-school liaison, school completion, school attendance; looking at policies across Government through the lens of children and young people and working effectively across Government to promote their well-being; addressing inequalities robustly; and critically evaluating our performance, and taking decisions informed by the best available evidence and research.  I was delighted to hear about the recent outcomes and outputs of the Growing Up in Ireland survey and the Better Outcomes, Brighter Future consortium that I chaired last week.  These are my overall strategic objectives, which then translate into a number of tangible priority actions that I want to advance.<\/p><p> One of the biggest contributions we can make as a society to families is to provide high-quality affordable child care.  We made some progress recently but I want to do a lot more.  I am pleased that the ECCE scheme was extended by an average of 23 extra weeks under budget 2016.  This improvement came into effect from 1 September, with additional entry points in January and April next.<\/p><p> In 2017, my major proposal is for a single affordable child care scheme.  This will combine a number of existing schemes and, more important, extend the numbers of children and families eligible for subsidised child care over time.  My intention is to introduce some form of subsidisation of child care costs for nine to 36-month-old children who are looked after by registered child care providers.  This is a key element of the budget negotiations at present.<\/p><p> Of critical concern to me is that we promote and support a constantly developing culture of quality in the sector, to add to what we have achieved in recent times.  I recognise the commitment of those working in the sector and want to do all I can to address quality, sustainability and working conditions.  Of course, we are not the employers in the sector and cannot set pay rates, but I am conscious of the issues that professionals face and I believe that it is possible over time to take positive steps to help address their concerns.  Unless we do this we will not have a sustainable child care system.<\/p><p> I am particularly pleased with the work we have done, in close collaboration with all involved, to put in place the new access and inclusion model, AIM.  From the feedback I have received, I believe the new AIM model is having a positive impact and will continue to make a real difference.  I am delighted that the model was introduced on schedule and that take-up of various elements is increasing.<\/p><p> At my request, Tusla has maintained its emphasis on implementing a three-year plan to eliminate the list of unallocated cases and to ensure it does not recur.  This is the second year of the action plan, and I can assure the committee that it is a high priority for me in budgetary negotiations for next year.  Unallocated cases have fallen by 50% since the establishment of Tusla in 2014, and  there has been a fall of 25% in such cases since the end of 2015.  We need to keep the momentum in order to eliminate the list of cases.<\/p><p> Another key element of the reform programme is the development of a modern ICT system to support social workers.  The national child care information system will ensure that every social work department can record the case history of every child, who is the subject of a child protection or welfare concern.  This will apply from the point of initial referral to case closure.  The system will also have the capacity to facilitate the integration and sharing of information on child protection and welfare cases between Tusla areas.  The continued roll-out of the system is a necessity.<\/p><p> A lifelong concern of mine has been the inequality faced by many groups in society.  I have committed to a set of important actions in the area of child homelessness as part of the Government&rsquo;s action plan on housing and homelessness.  Of course the overall solution is to prevent families from becoming homeless in the first place and to restore them as quickly as possible to their own accommodation when homelessness arises, but there are a number of practical steps we can take to support those in emergency accommodation, including access to early years services, school completion services and free public transport for school journeys.  I will continue to work with my colleagues in government to ensure that we deliver a joined-up set of supports to those who are homeless, and to use pragmatic solutions.<\/p><p> Staying with the theme of inequality, another key concern of mine is addressing child poverty.  As with homelessness, this is a personal and human issue which we must combat.  The key to this is to work together, through public, private, community and voluntary sectors.  We must work with young people, parents and front-line agencies.  It is not only about income supports &ndash; even though these play a vital role.  It is about providing services such as child care.  We need to prepare children for school so that they have an equal chance at the opportunities that education provides.  I believe that education is key to lifting children out of poverty in the long term.  Of course, we have substantial research evidence to back this up.  Among the initiatives I want to continue supporting will be the ABC programme, which I will also seek to support in the coming budget.<\/p><p> I am strongly committed to advancing our legislation on adoption.  The Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and I look forward to working with all the committee members when we reach Committee Stage, our first Committee Stage together, which has been set for 2 November.  I am pleased to say that the adoption (information and tracing) Bill is at an advanced stage of development and I hope to bring it to Government for approval to publish later this month.<\/p><p> The last D&aacute;il enacted an important piece of child protection legislation, namely the Children First Act 2015.  We have commenced implementation of some provisions, and I will shortly announce a plan for the phased and structured implementation of all of the remaining sections.<\/p><p> Since becoming Minister, I have visited a number of youth services and projects, and met many young people in the context of a range of initiatives that they have been involved in.  I have been hugely impressed by the enthusiasm of our young people, and especially by their confident attitude to what they, and we, as a society, can achieve.  In particular, I have enjoyed my discussions with young people on participation in decision-making about issues affecting them.<\/p><p> I have put forward the case during the budgetary process to achieve a favourable increase in funding for youth organisations.  In addition, my Department is working on the development of the promised LGBT youth strategy that will encompass education, youth services, mental health and other issues of priority to young people.  Also, a lead team is in place in my Department to implement our first ever national youth strategy.  While the youth sector may attract less commentary than other areas, it is a key focus for the coming year.<\/p><p> We all want to build better lives for our children and young people and I hope what I have outlined today will go some way towards achieving that.  As I said at the outset, I would very much like to hear details of the members' own priorities and suggestions about how we, together, can make this a better country for children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#H01300","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

Minus the ICT, are we on target for delivering the programme under capital expenditure?  I am back again asking whether we are on target regarding Tusla staff.  Do we have the key people to reduce what we already discussed, namely, the 50% in retrospective cases?  Do we have the social care network in place to deliver services?

The Minister raised a specific issue, namely, the position of children in hotels and the opportunity to provide them with free transport to school, after school care and social activities.  It is the right thing to do and I commend her on it.  I do not know what programme it is in or whether it is in any programme we are discussing.  I do not know where to raise it, but it is important.  Is it in place?  It was to start at the beginning of October.  Is it comprehensive for all children living in hotels?  Could the Minister give us some information about how it works and how families can avail of it?  It would be very important for people trying to manage their money and give their children an opportunity to live as full and normal a life as possible in a very difficult family situation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding unallocated cases, the Minister indicated there was an under-profile figure.  Could she clarify whether there is adequate funding to deal with the target number for this year?  The target is gradually to reduce the number of unallocated cases and the Minister told us the number of allocated cases in July was 5,050.  That was fewer than earlier in the year.  The 2016 target was for a reduction of 60% in the number of open cases, which would bring the number of unallocated cases to 2,700.  Is the target being monitored on a very regular basis and can the Minister give us information as to how it is progressing?  Can the Minister indicate whether there are concerns regarding the availability of social workers?  We got some information about a relatively small percentage of children who are in private foster case and there has been a concern about the cost of private care.  Could the Minister clarify whether she is monitoring it and the outcomes, and whether there are plans.  I presume private care is used only where no other kind of care is available.  Is the Minister monitoring it in terms of why care by private companies is more expensive than regular foster care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#K00400","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas roimh an Aire agus an foireann.

Regarding the Minister's statement, it is very welcome that we will take Committee Stage of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 on 2 November and that we will also have a draft of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill soon.  Deputies Anne Rabbitte and Jan O'Sullivan and other Deputies and Senators raised it previously.  Is it possible that the legislative provisions in the adoption (information and tracing) Bill might be considered as Government amendments or amendments generally to the Adoption (Amendment) Bill when it comes before us on Committee Stage?  They could be dealt with more quickly and comprehensively as a single piece of legislation at that juncture.<\/p> <p>  By the end of 2017, there is to be a reduction from 20% to 15% in unallocated cases, if the targets are met, but that still leaves 2,700 unallocated cases.

It is great to have the questions.  I will start with Deputy Anne Rabbitte's questions and my answers may cut across similar questions from the other Deputies.  The capital expenditure by Tusla, including on ICT, is on target.  Tusla is working on a comprehensive ICT strategy, which I expect to receive shortly.  Progress on the national child care information system is slightly behind schedule but it is progressing.  My officials are working closely with Tusla to drive the development.  I have met the chairman and the CEO recently and stressed the importance of ICT as a key aspect to promotion for a modern child care protection service.  I feel encouraged and supported by the Deputy's interest in it to drive this priority.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about staff recruitment in Tusla.  The Deputy will be aware that Tusla is extremely proactive in its recruitment.<\/p><p>At the end of August 2016, Tusla had 3,570 whole-time equivalent staff employed compared with 3,460 at the end of December 2015.  Its number of full-time equivalent staff has increased by 110, in effect, as a result of recruitment.  Tusla is engaged in a three-year plan to address human resource deficiencies across its multidisciplinary workforce of social workers and others.  As part of the process of recruiting that multidisciplinary workforce, Tusla has more than 70 recruitment campaigns going on.  It is dealing with in excess of 1,500 applicants for various roles across the organisation and it has completed 650 interviews to date.  Like many Deputies, I am particularly interested in what is going on with the recruitment of social workers.  If Tusla is to meet its target of having 1,570 whole-time equivalent staff in this area by the end of 2016, it will have to recruit approximately 150 more social workers by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#K00600","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>That is where I was coming from.

A total of 248 social work graduates were recently put on a panel and 69 of them have been offered posts.  I have a lot more detail in that regard if the Deputy would like it.  In response to the focus of her question, I was trying to describe the various campaigns that are ongoing to recruit the diversity of staff that will be required by Tusla.<\/p> <p>  I might come back to the question about the family resource agencies in a moment.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked about the position of children in emergency accommodation and the things I have identified in that regard.  I think she is aware that a section of the housing and homelessness action plan specifically identifies measures that are to be implemented for children while they are in emergency accommodation.  For example, school transport is a key aspect of those measures.  As the Deputy knows, children and families can be housed in emergency accommodation that is some distance from their schools.  The first thing to say is that the provision of school transport for children who are homeless is being administered through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  It will come out of that budget.  I assure the committee that 24-hour, five-day passes will be issued to families before the bank holiday weekend.  Leap cards are being organised for children and accompanying adults.  That will be done by the end of this month.  This will benefit children and families that already use public transport.  That relates back to the transport issue we discussed earlier.<\/p> <p>  At a very early stage of our negotiations regarding children in homeless emergency accommodation, we found money within the Tusla budget to support two additional child support workers who work with Focus Ireland and other front-line agencies.  We are looking for an additional number of child support workers as part of the budgetary and Estimates process.  We hope we can get them.  We are developing a specific scheme to ensure child care supports like the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme are available to children who are in homeless or emergency accommodation.  Perhaps Ms McNally can confirm whether we are doing that right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#L00500","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We will be doing it before the end of the year.

We are working across Government in terms of some of the other commitments.<\/p> <p>  I have answered Deputy O'Sullivan's question about social workers, so I will move on to the issue of foster care costs.  Approximately 6% of children in foster care are placed in private companies.  The cost of Tusla foster care does not include the cost of social work time, as well as other types of supports.  I think it is important to acknowledge that the cost of private care often includes the cost of other supports provided to children who have special needs.  I refer, for example, to the cost of psychologists and other therapists.  I ask my official, Ms Clarke, to address this specific question further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#L00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The key issue to bear in mind when the cost of private care is compared with the cost of Tusla care is that the Tusla cost does not include costs associated with social workers' time and salaries, assessments, link workers and supports to families.  By comparison, the private companies' costs cover everything they provide.  For that reason, it can appear that private care costs much more than Tusla care.  In fact, that ratio would not be correct.  I should also mention that Tusla sometimes identifies private foster care as an appropriate placement for a child with very special needs.  In some cases, companies are able to surround some children with supports that might not be available to those children in the general population of foster care.  There is no doubt that private care has also been used when shortages have emerged.  The social workers who are being recruited will not all be sent into child protection, as some of them will go into backfilling the foster care teams that have become depleted.  This will allow Tusla to recruit, train and support its own foster carers.  That is part of Tusla's plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Michele Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I think the cost is under review as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#L00900","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Michele Clarke"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Clarke.

Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked about adoption legislation.  I know Deputy O'Sullivan and all the members of the committee have an interest in this.  I remind them that the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 was the first Bill to be brought into this D&aacute;il for Second Stage debate.  At that time, it may have seemed like we would have a long wait for the publication of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  I worked extremely closely with the officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General to make the information and tracing Bill a priority.  As a result, we are now in a position to say the Bill will be published this month.  That is the first thing I want to say in response to the question Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked earlier.  We are now in a different place in terms of timing.  We might have to approach the issue differently if we were not so close to publication.<\/p> <p>  It is important to mention that as members are aware, both Bills deal with different although related issues.  The information and tracing Bill contains a significant scheme that will help adopted people to trace their origins.  I do not think the provisions of that Bill could or should be taken merely as amendments to the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 itself.  It is too long and too important for that.  A great deal of work will remain to be done as part of this process even after the information and tracing Bill is published.  I looking forward to teasing out the provisions of the Bill and any amendments that may be proposed to it with the members of this committee.  As I have said, I am committed to publishing it as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>It will be published before the end of this month.  From a legislative perspective, it would probably do more justice to that second, more extensive complicated Bill, for which we have been waiting for so long, to keep them separate.<\/p><p> On unallocated cases, as we are all aware, Tusla has set a target to reduce the number of cases by 60% by the end of 2016.  The target is set but demand can go up and down.  That influences the way the target can ultimately be met.  That is why is it is important to take a look at the issue of how it is we are moving towards that target, even with the ways in which more people come into the system.  For example, a case needs to be opened and it is either allocated or not allocated.  More social workers are being recruited but, at the same time, the demand issue impacts the target.  With all of that, Tusla identified a 60% reduction with confidence.  There has been an ongoing downward trend, regardless of all the dynamism that is going on from Tusla&rsquo;s perspective in terms of the reduction of the number of unallocated cases.  Between January and the end of July, it went down by 25%.  Since the establishment of Tusla on January 2014, the number of unallocated cases has decreased by 48%.  The trend is downward, no matter which way one looks at the figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#L01800","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>By way of background, it is important to point out that of the over 700 cases currently listed as high priority, they comprise three different categories of children.

They may be well known and may have been receiving a service for quite a period but perhaps their social worker has left.  Accordingly, while awaiting a replacement, they become a high-priority unallocated case.  The third are children in care who obviously are known to Tusla but, again, where their social worker has left.<\/p> <p>  There are three different categories.

This team will have done an initial preliminary look at the issues, the cases and the background.  They may have met the family or the child and gotten as much information as possible.  On that basis, the team would have continued to monitor the case.  It could be a telephone call, a visit or checking with a teacher or a nurse, who has seen the child, to see if the child&rsquo;s situation is changing or is becoming less at a risk.  There could be a case where a grandmother moves in and becomes protective in the child&rsquo;s life.  It is a very dynamic list in that way.<\/p> <p>  That is not to say, however, that Tusla is not keen to have allocated social workers for all of their cases and are working towards that.  When we get into the bulk of the other cases, some of the cases in the low priority are those scheduled to need a family support service.  The question, again, of increasing community supports will remove those families from this list.  It is important to understand that once an assessment is done, it does not mean the case is closed.  Social workers are engaged with thousands of children who are not in care and who are not waiting.

The latest figures show there are 2,300 children in emergency accommodation.  That is one in every three people in emergency accommodation.  There is also the hidden homeless such as those couch-surfing or borrowing space in sheds.  From meetings in constituencies over the past several years and having worked as a mental health nurse, I have watched seven and nine-year old children in emergency accommodation regress in their development and become more infantile.  Some have become doubly incontinent and started sucking their thumbs, for example.  Their development is stunted and this a time bomb for their mental health in the making.

It is important she hears what the issues are at ground level.<\/p> <p>  One issue which deeply concerns me, one which I will be focusing on for the next year, is mental health for children and adolescents.  It is quite obvious that child psychiatry is dying.  We often talk about waiting lists for CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, or children looking for assessment.  Many of these children have serious issues such as eating disorders or suicidal ideation.  Not only are they quite serious issues, they are life-threatening ones.<\/p> <p>  When the Taoiseach spoke to the Seanad for two hours last week, not once did he mention mental health.  It was all about Brexit and the relationship between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland.  Once again, mental health is the poor cousin.  Every Government has ignored the issues which concern mental health.  When I say child psychiatry is dying, I literally mean it.  We have assessment teams which are unable to assess because there is no psychiatrist in place.  The main problem is that our graduates are facing a salary which is half what it would be elsewhere in the world while working double the time.  No wonder we have nobody to replace psychiatrists who are leaving the system.<\/p> <p>  We can talk about this forever.  We can talk about bringing budgets and including more moneys into salaries.  The people are not there, however, to do that because they are not interested.  We do not make it an attractive country in which to work in psychiatry.<\/p> <p>  I believe unused moneys are returned to the Department each year.  Will there be moneys returned this year?  If so, how much?  Can we use these moneys to come up with an immediate reactionary action plan to deal with these child psychiatry waiting lists and to look at the potential of PICUS, psychiatric intensive care units?<\/p><p>This is something to which I will dedicate my time here.  I will continue to talk about this until somebody eventually listens.

I have a question.  Is there such a thing as unallocated social workers for children in care?  Does every child in care have a social worker or are there still unallocated workers for such children?  I realise that children in care will have different levels of need for social workers.  Some children could be in care for up to six or seven years or from birth and might not have any requirement for a social worker if there is no access and the birth parent is not involved.  Where a teenager comes into care, however, there could be massive demands.  The allocated social workers figure is a raw crude figure that we can get hung up on, but I am more concerned that the services which the social workers are trying to access for the children are available.  Ultimately, the social worker is an intermediary trying to get intervention for the child in care.  Children in care have major issues with and have been traumatised by abandonment, the loss of parental influence, rejection and so forth.  There is a vicious cycle for them as they grow up in care, go out into the world and try to deal with all of that.  We have failed to invest adequately in the type of therapies that are required by these children.  Is there a promise in the Minister's budget for the coming year to increase that and to ensure that Tusla will become more proactive in this area as opposed to reactive, particularly with regard to interventions for teenagers in care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2016100500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  Senator Devine's first question referred to the fact that delays are being experienced by some graduates in registering with CORU, the registration body, which would put them in a position to get a job.  I am aware of and concerned about that.  A successful candidate awaiting registration may be offered a three-month temporary contract as a project worker.  That is not a full solution, but it is one action that has been put in place.  Tusla is also assisting candidates on the panels with their applications for registration.  That said, representatives of Tusla met recently with those of CORU and there is ongoing engagement with them.  Tusla is working with graduates to ensure that they will have all of their paperwork in order.  I have also met with some of my constituents who are experiencing difficulties due to the delays.  I am aware of this concern and Tusla is proactively addressing it.  However, it is important that proper checks and Garda vetting are in place.  At the same time, there may be room for improvement.  I am heartened that Tusla is conducting that ongoing engagement.  However, I will raise the matter with it again.<\/p> <p>  With regard to her question about children in emergency accommodation who are homeless and children being born into homelessness, the Senator articulated the issue very well.  It is very upsetting to be aware of that and to see it happening in some instances.  It is important to offer that type of commentary so we all stay focused and motivated to ensure that the target set by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Coveney, that within a year we will not be dependent on emergency accommodation for children and families who are homeless, is achieved.  It is a very ambitious target and I have offered him my personal support and interest with regard to any other measures which must be in place for that target to be met.  This is not the setting to outline all the issues he has identified in the plan to ensure we will no longer be dependent on emergency accommodation, but it is really important that the target was set.<\/p> <p>  My second response to the Senator's remarks in that regard is that of course any day, week or month a child spends in that situation has the potential to impact them negatively, and undoubtedly is impacting upon them negatively.  My primary concern, knowing the context or limitations of my Department, was whether there was something we could do.  Initially we talked about trying to see if there was any way in which we could normalise or bring some sense of normality or ease to the children's days and experiences while they were in that situation.  The measures we identified and are putting in place are specifically geared towards minimising the negative impact of their time being homeless or in emergency accommodation.  There is the short-term target to end our dependency on emergency accommodation for children and families and then there is the immediate set of measures to mitigate the impact of the negative effect of that.  The Senator's question about research on the ways in which they have been impacted is a good one.  It is something we could consider.<\/p> <p>  I thank Senator Freeman for her extraordinary commitment to and tenacity in respect of the issue of mental health in general and especially for children and young people and for her effectiveness in working in that arena.  I will make a few comments and my departmental officials might wish to comment as well.  With regard to young people and mental health, the Senator will be aware that a task force has been established and we will play an active role with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in that.  One of my commitments as Minister with responsibility for children is to ensure that a child's lens is brought across Government Departments, so that there is a focus on children even though I do not have control on many things directly in my Ministry.  We will feed into that process extensively.<\/p> <p>  The Senator will also be aware that the Department's Vote supports youth organisations.  I have met with a number of them.  As I travelled throughout the country, I specifically wanted to meet organisations that are working with young people who are challenged by mental health issues.  That this is growing, especially for young people as distinct from it occurring later on in life, and all the reasons for that are deeply upsetting.  To the extent that I have direct responsibility, that is one of the key motivating factors for me to seek some increases in supports to the youth organisations that work specifically on mental health issues.  The Senator and others will be aware that there were significant cuts to youth organisations over the last number of years, so we are seeking to reverse them.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the people who are working in this field and said that this might not be an attractive country in which to work in that context.  Indeed, and that is disturbing too.  All Ministers must take account of that.  It is not unlike the area of social work, which we have discussed a great deal.  One of the matters I have been examining with my Department is how to ensure that more social workers are trained and that there is a growth in places at third level so that the demand is met.  More recently we have been having conversations relating to social care workers, particularly in the context of being trained for working in settings such as Oberstown.  In the long term, perhaps we must look at how our social care graduates are being trained specifically for jobs within those settings and, in the context of that training, ways in which - at third level or in our engagement with young people - we might make it more attractive.  I hear the Senator's concern.<\/p><p>I will bring that question to the attention of my other colleagues because it is an excellent one.  <\/p><p> Senator Freeman asked about unused moneys in my budget.  There is never any money returned to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs by Tusla.  There was a Supplementary Estimate in the Department's Vote in 2015.  I referred in my opening remarks to how their eyes and ours are on the ball in order that if it appears there will be additional moneys within a certain aspect of the Vote, there will be ways to ensure they are used.  There are great needs emerging beyond what we budget and the moneys will be spent.<\/p><p> I will move on to the questions asked by the Chairman, Deputy Jim Daly, who has an ongoing interest in this area and has shown commitment and generosity.  On the question about children in care being allocated a social worker, Tusla has prioritised all new children coming into care, particularly those with a disability or mental health problem.

I am aware of all the challenges in that regard.  It is the role of the social worker to ensure there is access to services.  The Chairman wrote to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, about this issue asking to meet him and asking about the possibility of setting up a group to deal with the issue.  It is a good suggestion.

His question on whether we are helping children who come into care and how they can live their lives afterwards is important.  The reports we hear about tend to be when something has gone wrong.  We are gathering information to look at the overall welfare of children at the end.  Some 55% of children over 18 who were in care are continuing in education and training and 45% continue to live with their former foster carers as young adults in care.  Our stability rates for children in placements are much better than our neighbours in the UK.  It is a crude measure but less than 3% of children have more than three placements in a year whereas the figure in the UK is around 10% and 11%.  These are crude measures but they tell us something about the majority of children.  It is not to say we should ignore the challenges faced by children who come into care very damaged by their earlier experiences or who have not been able to settle and so have had poor experiences.

It is an issue that an awful lot of child care professionals have to register with the Department of Social Protection during the summer and it needs to be tackled very urgently.  I note the detail in the Minister's proposals for additional child care subsidy.  I and my party advocate a more universal programme.  It is something that needs to be considered.  On the proposal for the subsidisation of child care costs for children aged between nine months and 36 months, there is a bit of a gap between when maternity benefit comes to an end and the beginning of that scheme.  It is a period of three months.  That gap should be bridged to address the costs that would be involved in that.

I am concerned there seems to be a slippage in the timeframe for the delivery of the transport provision.  The school year started at the beginning of last month but problems remain.  Can the Minister confirm that the 24-hour passes will be delivered before the bank holiday weekend?

We are aware this is a huge issue.  As the Deputy may know, I launched a report, Breaking Point, this week, which highlighted the particular problem in the context of community services and children who are disadvantaged.  Our eyes are absolutely focused on this issue and on trying to find the most effective way to ensure there is additional support to safeguard the sustainability of the sector.  That translates to better pay and conditions for staff, which, ultimately, is the only way we can ensure our children receive the quality care they deserve.  We are aware of all that and are looking at the most effective ways to address the issue of capitation rates.  There has been an increase in the higher capitation rate, which Ms McNally might like to explain presently.  We are trying to determine the most efficient way to begin to address that concern.  I am hoping we can do it somehow, depending on the Estimates.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the eligibility period of nine to 36 months and whether we should offer support sooner than that.  As he knows, there is a maternity leave allocation for new mothers and we have just implemented the provision of two weeks of paternity leave.

We expect this will be inclusive of investing in the workforce as well as particular supports for children at every level to ensure that we can put our supports for children with disability in the mainstream of the early childhood care and education scheme.  It is available from 1 September.  The issue around not spending as much is going to change now and spending will increase.  Since children started enrolling, they have become eligible for the ECCE scheme and they are immediately eligible for AIM.  I will answer a number of questions about the ECCE scheme raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  The provider should contact the local county child care committee or the Better Start team in Pobal.  The details are on the Department's website.<\/p><p> We believe the model is going really well.  As I have already indicated, it was rolled out on schedule.  There has been an extraordinary take-up of and interest in the different supports being provided as a result of the model, whether they relate to upskilling of the workforce or the link programme.  Again, 900 people are enrolled to begin the training.  They have to do the training and then come back to the service subsequently.  That is why it will take some time for its effectiveness and for the cultural change to materialise.<\/p><p> At a higher level support is part of the model.  Effectively we are providing support for what we call an additional pair of hands, for example, for a severely disabled child who has been identified for support.  It is important to point out that we are trying to provide some additional moneys to be paid for someone to work 15 hours per week in order that the preschool leader can be freed up to work with the child.  The aim is to ensure specialised support and experience comes from the leader at another level.  The support involves a mentor going into the service and working on the spot with questions, problems or issues they may have with some of our children.  We have had 800 applications for people to come in to help with the services.  A total of 506 site visits have taken place.  I am trying to give a little detail on the model because there have been some questions about it.  In any event, I am of the view that it has been well thought out and designed.  It is on target and is being delivered.  We have moneys to continue a full year roll-out.<\/p><p> A question was asked on the over-profile of the B5 subhead.

I thank the committee for inviting me here this morning.  I really welcome the work of this committee, which is long overdue.  It is the first time in the history of the country that any attempt has been made to reach a cross-party consensus on the future of our health services, particularly the development of a universal health system where access to care is based on need, not income.<\/p> <p>  The committee has asked me to speak on the issue of inequality in access to health care.  As Deputies will know from their lived experience and from the constituents they meet every day, there are many inequalities in access to health care in Ireland.  This country is exceptional in terms of the fragmented, complex nature of health care and in the unequal access to diagnostics, treatment and care.<\/p> <p>  Internationally, when one refers to universal systems one is talking about an entitlement to package of care, that is, the health and social care services to which citizens are entitled.  In Ireland, because we do not have a universal system, there simply is no such thing as a package of care.  People do not know what services they are entitled to and accessing social and health care services depends on whether one has a medical card, a GP visit card, private health insurance, an ability to spend money from one's own pocket on health services, where one lives and what type of services one is trying to access.\u00a0  Decades worth of research shows that it is the poorest, the sickest and people with disabilities who find it hardest to pay charges no matter how small those charges may seem and who find it harder to negotiate access.  Indeed, any of us who has accessed the system  - and GPs in particular know this because they do it every day -  knows how difficult it is to negotiate one's way through it.  It is also the poorest, the sickest and those with disabilities who have to wait longest for care.  <\/p> <p>  Medical cards, which currently cover about 36% of the population, are a proven pro-poor measure.  They are a positive safety net for the poorest third of society.  It is actually the poor, the sick and people with disabilities who do not have medical cards but who are on lower incomes who fare worst in terms of coverage and access.\u00a0  I do a lot of international work in Europe and with the World Health Organization, WHO, and when I present data showing that we do not have universal access to primary care, people do not believe it.  We are absolutely unique in a European context in not having universal access to primary care.  When I present data showing that 54% of the population has to pay, on average, &euro;50 for each GP visit, people are really stunned by that amount.  At the moment, 64% or two thirds of the population may have to pay up to &euro;144 per month for essential medication.  That is an awful lot of money out of anybody's income.  <\/p> <p>  Technically, we do have universal access to the public hospital system - or at least we did -  in that everyone is entitled to public hospital care.  However, measures that were introduced, such as the &euro;100 fee for accident and emergency departments and the &euro;750 per year charge for inpatient care mean that people without medical cards often cannot afford this.  Even if one does have free or without charge access to the health system - we are all paying for it in lots of different ways - the very long wait times for accessing public hospital care mean these public patients are denied access.  This is further exacerbated in the Irish context by what is called our two-tier hospital care, which incentivises and pushes people into private care.\u00a0<\/p><p>The inequalities in access we have manifest themselves in different ways, people without free general practitioner, GP, care or a medical card delay or do no not go to a GP in the first place due to cost.  <\/p><p> When people present at a GP, often she will often need to send them for diagnostic tests.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, told the committee last week that it has done comprehensive research showing the poor access for patients who could not afford to pay privately to access an essential scan or test.  One part of its research showed that 10% of GPs had direct access to a MRI scan in the public system with an average waiting time of 22 weeks whereas all GPs had access to MRI scans in the private sector within seven working days.  This public-private divide further delays diagnosis and treatment for people who cannot afford to pay privately. <\/p><p> When a GP decides that a person needs to see a specialist we know there are extraordinarily long wait times to access that appointment in the public hospital system.  We hear these figures generally every month when the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, publishes them and when they come out they are in the news.  What hits the headline is that there are approximately 450,000 people waiting for that first outpatient appointment.  In a way that number is not the problem because that is probably the amount needed within any population of our size.  The problem is the numbers waiting a long time.  I updated the figures in advance of this meeting from the August figures which show there are over 74,000 people waiting more than a year for that first outpatient appointment and over 110,000 waiting six to 12 months and 95,000 waiting three to six months.  By any international benchmark zero to three months is a reasonable time to wait, any time after that is too long.  We have hundreds and thousands of people waiting too long. <\/p><p> When a specialist decides that treatment is needed, after this first outpatient appointment wait there are also long waits for this.  Despite the efforts of the last Government to reduce waiting times for treatment, and they had some impact in 2012 and early 2013, there have been longer waiting times for all groups since then, except those waiting over two years.  Nobody should have to wait over two years for either that specialist first outpatient appointment or that specialist treatment.  <\/p><p> None of these points touches on the inequalities in access to community services such as home helps, public health nursing, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapy, mental health services mainly because the data is so bad or does not exist.  The HSE has begun to collect it in some areas but only in the past year or so.  That means I cannot present that time series data we have for hospital services but such services are equally if not more important than hospital services.  There are huge inequalities in accessing these, often depending on whether one has a medical card and on the existence or capacity of a service in the area where the patient lives.<\/p><p> Part of the complexity of the Irish system is the result of the existence and overlap of private health insurance on the public health system.  We are unique for a high income Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, country for the way we marry private health insurance and the public hospital system.  We know that people who can afford to pay privately can get their diagnostic tests quicker, get to see a specialist quicker and if insured may be able to get their treatment quicker.<\/p><p> My current role in the Centre for Health Policy and Management in Trinity College Dublin is co-ordinating a Health Research Board, publicly funded, project called 'mapping the pathways to universal healthcare'.  In this project we are monitoring Government progress, or perhaps the absence of it, towards a universal health care system.  Initial policy analysis work that we have done, which was published at the end of last year, found that despite the rhetoric and the intention of increased universalism between 2011 and 2015, there was in fact less, not more, universalism now than there was in 2011.  This is due to the further increase in drug charges for people with and without medical cards, the introduction of lifetime community rating and the failure to reduce waiting times for access for public patients.  The one exception to some progress on universalism was the extension of free GP care to those aged over 70 and under six years.  We know internationally that insurance-based systems, such as those in the USA or the Netherlands, are more expensive and cause inequalities.  In Ireland, 45% of population have private health insurance yet it contributes less than 10% to the overall health budget.<\/p><p> In the project in Trinity my colleague, Dr. Sarah Barry, is leading on a systematic review on the organisational challenges of introducing universal health care.  Professor Steve Thomas, who the committee has met privately, and Bridget Johnston, are doing groundbreaking work on financial protection.  This is the first time this work has been done in Ireland.  Financial protection is a core component of the World Health Organization's definition of universal healthcare which in effect means that health and access to health care should not cause impoverishing or catastrophic health expenditure.  The terms are quite technical and I will spare the committee the detail on them.  Catastrophic, however, means that people are forgoing essential expenditure in other areas to meet health service needs, usually out of pocket payments.<\/p><p> Initial work we have done on quantifying the amount of out of pocket spending is presented in the accompanying graph.  This does not count everything people spend privately on health care, it counts only what we were able to count.  It showed that in 2014 Irish citizens paid &euro;580 million more out of their pockets for essential, generally hospital care or drug charges, than they did in 2008.  We are doing more detailed work using the Central Statistics Office, CSO, national household budget survey data.  It went into the field again earlier this year but we do not have the data from that.  We have, however, analysed the 2009-2010 data, exploring the extent of affordability of private health expenditure and what proportion of Irish citizens are financially protected, or not, when they access health care.  We found that the poorest people who experience catastrophic levels of private health expenditure, almost 50% of the poorest fifth of the population reported unaffordable levels of private health spending.  I have given the committee the breakdown of expenditure according to those income quintiles.  Two interesting observations arise from this data, one is that the poorest 40% of the population spent most on private health insurance and the highest level of out of pocket, unaffordable spend from those with middle and higher incomes was on dental care.  These figures come from a diary people keep of what they spent their money on so they do not catch unmet need.  They catch only what people actually spend.  We know that low income groups do not go to the dentist because of the barrier of cost.  <\/p><p> Providing timely access to appropriate care for the whole population, which is in effect a universal health system, will cost more money and require more staff.  Professor Thomas is studying workforce requirements and our current staffing profile as a basis for getting to universal health care.  He is also reviewing potential areas for positive rationing.  In other words, how we can use the resources we have more efficiently so that universal health care is affordable and deliverable.<\/p><p> The work we are engaged on in this project, 'mapping the pathways to universal healthcare', aims to devise tangible steps towards a universal health care system, work we hope will be of use to the work of this committee.  Delivering a universal health system is a political choice which is in the power of the committee.  It is a political choice that is a matter of life and death to some people.  It can improve all people's lives, our quality of life and indeed our deaths.  I wish the committee well with its work and am happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sara Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Thank you for the presentation.

My first question relates to evidence the committee heard from Professor Allyson Pollock on universal access underpinned by legislation.  What are Dr. Burke's views on whether it is preferable to put legislation in place and frantically work towards it or to incrementally build to a point where we are in position to put the legislation in place with the heavy lifting already done?  While Dr. Burke could probably guess my personal views on it, I would be very interested to hear her view.<\/p> <p>  I view the NTPF as privatisation by stealth, and probably the worst form of privatisation, given that people are being told it is not privatisation and it is good for them.  There is a backlog, and there is a role for outside providers to clear the backlog.  I would be interested to know the extent to which Dr. Burke thinks it might be possible to switch off the tap of the NTPF and how quickly it could be done.<\/p> <p>  Bizarrely, I read on Twitter that there is another new structure in the HSE.  I have not heard the rationale for it and I do not understand it.  I am sure it has something to do with governance and accountability.  Professor Pollock would have spoken to us about it.  Although in Britain the buck stops with the secretary with responsibility for health, they have very much strengthened local accountability.  Does Dr. Burke believe the structures in the HSE are fit for purpose?  I hesitate to use that phrase given that I do not mean it necessarily in that way.  I refer to the manner in which they could be improved.  Would we be better to focus on more local accountability rather than high-level accountability, which is where the HSE is focused?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#D00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>What is the new structure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#D00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>The one Fergal Bowers very kindly tweeted last week.

One of my questions was the one Deputy Louise O'Reilly raised regarding the NHS legislation and whether it should be brought in initially.  She was very adamant that it would have to be the case.  The committee is established to be evidence based regarding what is the best health service for our country.  Reports such as this are very important for us to see the evidence on whether private health care is good or bad.  The item that strikes me is that out of pocket spending had increased since 2008 to &euro;580 million.  This was during one of the worst periods austerity and cutbacks that we have had, and people have had to fork out extra money along with it.  Dr. Burke said if we went to the NHS style of health care it would cost money.  How do we determine this cost if we are saving in some areas and having to pay in others, for example, the &euro;580 million in out of pocket expenses?  How and when do we know what the costs will be?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Burke mentioned more staff.  Could she develop this issue?  We are losing staff.  How do we retain our staff?  What is Dr. Burke's opinion?  If we are processing the idea of a national health service - I do not know if the entire committee agrees - we will need resources and they must be put in place early to ensure we have staff in the future to retain them.  Should the State pay for nurses' and midwives' training and insist they stay in Ireland for the following ten or 15 years and be embedded them in rural areas to pay it back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#D01500","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Many of my questions have been asked, especially the issue of accountability which Deputy Louise O'Reilly raised.  It comes up over and over again.  Dr. Burke touched on dental care.  Poor dental care leads to underlying problems later, such as heart problems.  We keep raising the issue that we are a cure society rather than a prevention society.  Would Dr. Burke look at initiating it very quickly and start rolling out the schemes we used to have with free dental checks and care such as cleanings?  It is a preventative measure on a huge scale.  We probably have the worst dental record in Europe among young children, never mind adults.  In her opening statement, Dr. Burke mentioned that while 45% of the population has private health insurance, it contributes to only 9% of the total cost of care.  Could she explain more about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#D01600","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I listened with interest to Professor Pollock very strongly make the case for NHS-like legislation.  It is an issue.  Do we go for the big bang reform or do it incrementally?  Professor Pollock has been working on NHS legislation during recent years as a mechanism of undoing the breakdown of the NHS and the marketisation that has happened in England.  It is specific to there.  The bread and butter of my academic research is policy making processes.  In the literature, there is the big bang legislative change, which is what the universal health insurance was planned to be, very much driven by then Minister, Senator James Reilly.  Ireland tends to take the path of incremental change.  There are other methods of doing it somewhere in between.  What the committee is doing fits into what is conceptually written about in the literature as a blueprint method.  The committee is reaching a consensus and developing a detailed plan, and there is a body of work to be done with the public, the heath service and politicians to deliver on it within a reasonable period of time.  We have not come down either way.  I do not know which is the best answer.<\/p> <p>  The committee is to produce its report early in the new year.  It will not be able to say, on 1 February 2017, that we will have a national health system, universally accessible to all and free at the point of delivery.  We simply do not have the capacity to do it.  We do not have the resources or the staff in place to do it.  The blueprint methodology of reaching political consensus is very important, but we must also reach a public agreement that we want a certain type of service.<\/p><p>We hear all the time that Irish people are very discontented.  Public services top opinions polls when it comes to things about which Irish people are most upset.  If we want European-style public services, we must start paying European levels of tax or PRSI to pay for them.  Politicians, many of us carrying out research and leaders in the health system must win the argument that if we want really good public services, we must pay for them.<\/p><p> Part of my PhD involved looking at the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly that it worked for the people who got treatment.  If someone has been waiting for a very long time and receives their treatment privately, obviously that is good for that individual but it does nothing to solve the long waits within the system.  We have seen it.  It has been in existence for all the years in respect of which I have presented the committee with data and the figures have gone up.  Yes, there is a role for the private sector to play in getting rid of that backlog but there are political choices to be made.  Do we want to use elective capacity within the private system on an ongoing basis or do we want to build up the public hospital system to deliver that care?  We need to build up the public hospital system to deliver that care.<\/p><p> I saw the report concerning the proposed structure.  I think it was a draft report from Tony O'Brien concerning reorganising the top of the HSE.  Colleagues of mine in Trinity College have done more work on it than I have but we can prove absolutely that most of alleged reform in Ireland over the past ten or 15 years has been just been reorganisation.  Has that reorganisation improved service delivery?  I think the large answer is \"No\".  There have been improvements in health and social care provision but they have nothing to do with the reorganisation that has happened.  I would advise against another reorganisation or restructuring and in favour of much more work on what can we do to improve access to services for people.  In a way, that is what we are doing.  The project in Trinity College involves looking at the barriers to access and how we can address them.  There is an issue around local accountability and yet what were the health boards?  Were the health boards a form of local accountability?  We got rid of them.  Do we really want to go back to having politicians decide?  I would urge against further restructuring and reorganisation and in favour of really reforming the system.<\/p><p> I hope I have answered Deputy Collins's question on the NHS.  The &euro;580 million in the graph involved austerity measures introduced in successive budgets - the emergency budget in 2008 and thereafter.  Among other measures, it involved taking medical cards away from those aged over 70.  It always astounded me, particularly as we were mapping these over time, that people were taking to the streets on other matters but not the fact that we as citizens are paying hundreds of millions more for essential public health care than we did eight or ten years ago.<\/p><p> There was a very good question about how we cost it.  It is part of what we are working on in the project, although it is not the specific aim of the project.  I know the ESRI is carrying out some work on that.  There is a big part of unmet need so we can cost demand or activity at the moment.  It is very hard to cost private sector activity because we do not have good information on it and it cannot be got.  We need a substantial piece of work on what is unmet need because we know there is a huge amount of it.  It is a hard thing to do but we can probably do ballparks on it.  We will lose some in certain areas that we gain in others so that &euro;600 million can be got through progressive tax measures rather than people having to pay out of pocket.<\/p><p> We need more staff.  I looked at the staff figures in recent days.  They have been increasing since 2013.  I cannot remember the figures but there are a few thousand more staff now than there were but we are just playing catch-up.  We are still not at pre-austerity levels of staffing so there is a body of catching up to do.  There is also the issue of meeting demographic needs never mind the unmet need about which we spoke.<\/p><p> Should we make people who train in the system stay here for ten or 15 years?  My PhD was publicly funded and I have said on the record much to everyone's delight that we should do so.  If someone is educated with public money, they should be giving something back.  It goes down like a lead balloon.  There is good evidence from other countries that it does not really work.  It is quite hard to keep graduates here so the trick is having a health system in which people want to work and where people are proud when they go to work every day and do not leave it really stressed and under pressure in the evenings.  That is about improving our health system but also retaining good quality staff.<\/p><p> Deputy Buckley spoke about dental care.  I am far from being an expert on dental care.  Some of the most severe austerity measures early on involved cutting back dental care to people on medical cards and in the PRSI scheme.  There is a huge body of work to be done in Ireland in terms of making dental care accessible to most people who need it.  Anybody who has children needing orthodontic care will say that it is next to impossible to get that within the public system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#D01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sara Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Been there, done that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#E00200","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>It is very expensive and that is not caught in the figure of &euro;580 million.<\/p> <p>  How would I explain how 45% of the population has private health insurance when it only contributes 9% of the cost?

It does not cover outpatient care generally, outpatient appointments with specialists in the first place, the cost of drugs and most primary care payments.  In effect, it is inpatient hospital insurance that people are scared into taking out because it gets them faster access.  It can be seen from the figures that it is very bad value for money because it does not cover the cost.

I tried to update the no cover figures for him.  I had no cover figures in the second slide but I did not put them in because, like everything in life, it is more complicated than it looks on paper for a couple of reasons.  There is a proportion of the population which has both medical cards and private health insurance, but currently we only have good information on the over 50s from the TILDA data.  There is old data which shows that for the entire population there is a 5% overlap between people with medical cards and people with private health insurance, but we also know that is much higher for older people and it progresses.  The older they get, the more likely the overlap, particularly during the time when all those over 70 had medical cards, so any estimates we have for no cover are only guesstimates.  Also, some people having free GP care and also private health insurance.<\/p> <p>  We can say there are people who do not have any of those who definitely have more difficulty accessing the system but everybody is vulnerable at a point in time.  Even if someone has the best private health insurance package that might cover them for high end hospital care, and they are back in the community, they might not get public health nursing or access to those basic public health services within the Health Service Executive, HSE, primary care team because they do not have a medical card.  It is not as simple as saying there is one group of people who fare badly.  Everybody is vulnerable at some stage, but we know that the poorest, the sickest and people with disabilities fare worse and that those without a medical card have the greater difficulties.  Everybody has difficulties, however, because if they are waiting 18 months for that first specialist appointment, that puts them in a very difficult position.<\/p> <p>  The next question was on charges.  I am interested in the Deputy's observations about the difference between a 50 cent charge and the &euro;2.50 charge, which is capped at &euro;25.  The evidence internationally is that no matter how small the charge, it deters as much necessary as unnecessary use.  Charges do deter use, no matter how small.  I do not know the details of the dental or the GP charging literature off the top of my head, so I will not pretend to.  I understand Dr. Josep Figueras will present to the committee next week and that might be a question to put to him in terms of application to the other areas but also in terms of the next question on whether private health insurance can assist in any way.<\/p> <p>  The problem with examining systems in other countries is that they have very different systems.  In France, one's care is covered generally by a social insurance system but there is also supplementary care by what is a form of private health insurance, namely, a not-for-profit private health insurance.  However, that is very different from the model we have here.  In terms of our model, if we are moving towards using public money in the best possible way, private health insurance should only cover someone for privately delivered care.  It should not cover what is subsidised within the public system.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Harty asked if staff shortages had an impact.  Of course they have an impact.  The Deputy sees it every day, but people experience it every day when they try to access services.  There is a range of services people cannot access because of the long waiting times or the services not having somebody in a particular area.  I refer to undoing the severe austerity cutbacks, but even if we got back to 2007-08 levels we still do not have the public health system GP staffing requirements to meet current population need.  We must significantly invest in staffing.  Investing in public health systems is a very productive economic measure because it provides jobs for people in their own communities who will then spend in their own communities.<\/p><p>It should be viewed as a positive spend and a resource rather than as a drain on society.<\/p><p> There is significant scope.  Better than any of us, Deputy Harty would understand the need for changed work practices and how secondary care always seems to get preference over primary and community care.  Staffing needs to be built up in primary and community care particularly.  Since that sector does not have the capacity to take on more work, we need more people, but we also need to be doing things differently.  We are beginning to see that happening.  Colleagues of mine in Trinity College Dublin costed the role of specialist epilepsy nurses in the community.  That work showed that, if someone with epilepsy had a link with a specialist epileptic nurse, it reduced or, in some instances, eliminated hospital admissions and the person stayed in work and was able to manage medication better.  This was a much cheaper and better quality of life for the person with epilepsy than if he or she had to go to hospital to see a specialist every time.  We need to be doing this for all chronic diseases.  General practitioners, GPs, need to be paid to manage chronic diseases in the community, as do specialist nurses, occupational therapists and other health professionals.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Harty on reconfiguration.  We have done a dreadful job of reconfiguration or reorganisation no matter how one looks at it.  We shut down units, especially in rural hospitals along the west coast, without beefing up services there or in the major centres.  Unsurprisingly, we are seeing the payback for that, for example, the level of demand placed on the emergency department in Galway or Limerick.  That is what happens when one stops some services without beefing up others, in particular primary and community care.  Had these services been resourced better, we would not have had some of the problems we have experienced.<\/p><p> Deputy Naughton's first question was on life expectancy and whether it was a useful tool.  It is, but health services and access to same only contribute a small amount to life expectancy.  They are important if one is sick and needs care, to quality of life and to outcomes.  Forgive me, as I am only four days back from maternity leave, so I do not have the figures off the top of my head.<\/p><p> Life expectancy is a useful figure in terms of inequalities in health.  One of my first policy jobs was in the Institute of Public Health in Ireland where, 15 years ago, we produced data showing that people with poorer incomes had much lower life expectancies than people with higher incomes.  There is a case for targeting.  One needs to invest in education, infrastructure, housing and career paths in those areas, but one also needs a greater delivery of health and social care services.  There is a role for these, not just for meeting the health needs of people in those communities, but also for acting as their employer.  In recent years, there has been a run down of HSE-employed home helps.  Often they were women from disadvantaged communities who provided care to people living near them.  We have contracted out much of that care.  Employing local people in what often are deprived areas is a good economic and health measure.<\/p><p> Did Deputy Naughton ask about ethnicity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sara Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Yes.

For example, our six hospital groups and nine community health groups are not aligned.  Given that integration is critical in a well-functioning health service, it is difficult to know how we can operate and conduct an assessment or measurement of outcomes when these two parallel systems have not been integrated.  The committee is grappling with the question of whether we should take on the issue of the current structure and recommend a restructure.

On the structure, what exists, exists and as for trying to change it, I think the Chairman is correct that people have restructuring fatigue.  Would it be more beneficial for us to look at what is there and try to build in the accountability, rather than change it?  Should we try to structure accountability into the structures that are there already, rather than spending our time trying to devise another structure, which will simply sit on the system that exists at present and will not deliver the type of reform needed?  We all recognise the need for reform but reform and restructuring are not the same thing.  Is it a case of parking the restructuring and looking at accountability and of trying to build in accountability at a local level and facilitate the level of co-operation that goes on at local level?  If one has ever hosted a conference for nurses, they will talk to one other about what is happening in their own areas and will learn from one other.  A significant amount of that goes on anyway without anyone trying to facilitate it.

The Minister has recently done that.  I think it is really good practice.  If one looks at what is happening there, it has nothing to do with the structure, because they have the exact same structure as anywhere else but it has to do with work processes that have been pioneered by GPs in the community and a couple of visionary people in the hospital.  It has, however, taken decades to develop and it is not like they started to try to do this two or three years ago; they have been doing it for decades.  That brings us to a useful point.  This is about resourcing processes in order that it is not dependent on the goodwill of a few innovative GPs and hospital doctors.  There is a GP and a hospital doctor who are married to each other and I bet that is crucial to the success of the Carlow-Kilkenny model.  It is about putting in place the processes in order that they are resourced and that people are paid to take time out to work out what is the best way for Sara Burke.  Does she need to go into hospital today or can she be managed at home or in the community for two days and then can she go in a planned way, rather than her ending up on a trolley tonight?  That is the nitty-gritty work they do at those meetings.  I think the effort is about resourcing those processes and putting them in place.

We have introduced these hospital groups, which brings me to Deputy Harty's question on top-down or bottom-up.  There are plans for the hospital groups to go to trust status and given the English experience of trusts, I do not think that is the way to go.  Given that we have groups, there are significant issues because we have this mix of HSE-funded hospitals and voluntary hospitals and it is very difficult for the hospitals to operate at present.  While they used to get their budgets individually, the funding now goes into the group but legally, the hospital chief executive officer or the board - depending on the status of the hospital - is actually accountable for how that money is spent.  There are major difficulties with that at present.  I think the bottom-up approach is a much more effective way to go.  The really good example of that is the success of the clinical care programmes.  It is the one area where we have had good success in improving both access and quality of care.  This was pioneered by Professor Tom Keane in cancer care.  He asked everyone working in cancer services how can we make cancer services more accessible and improve treatments so that our outcomes start reaching international standards.  It was a very bottom-up clinician-led reform of hospital services.  It needed political accountability and the then Minister, Ms Mary Harney, making difficult choices about reducing cancer care from 30 to eight hospitals.

I fully support the aim of this committee to set out a ten-year, cross-party vision for the future of Irish health care.  I have been following the work of the committee closely, trying to keep up with all of the papers presented thus far, which is a challenge, as well as preparing my submission.<\/p> <p>  Before I get into the detail of the submission, I would like to tell members a bit about myself and my background.  I am not an academic, although I did try to provide evidence and examples to support the contents of my submission.  I am coming from the field, so to speak, as I have worked within the system for a number of years, trying to make it work, sometimes successfully, other times not.  That is what I am trying to bring to the party this morning.  My professional experience includes a chief executive role with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, although I have stepped down from that position now.  I also worked with the Cope Foundation, an organisation that supports people with intellectual disabilities.  I worked with the Cork Simon Community for eight years providing support to people who were homeless.  I also worked with the Daycare Trust in the UK in the area of child care and early years education.  In addition, I worked as an advisor to Margaret Hodge, MP, for some years.  I have worked in many different parts of the system.  I am a qualified social worker, have an MBA and recently became a certified practitioner in change and consulting, which, in a sense, is what this committee is all about, that is, dealing with the stuff that seems obvious and really easy but which is so hard to do.<\/p> <p>  Stark health inequalities also exist for other marginalised and minority groups.  The average life expectancy of people experiencing homelessness is 47 years for men and a shocking 43 years for women.  I worked with the Cork Simon Community for eight years and when I walk around the city now, I do not meet the people I worked with in the past because most of them have died.  Homeless people die young.  Data shows that 60% of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, LGBTI, people have seriously thought of ending their own lives, with almost half of these considering it in the past year.  Younger LGBTI people are the most vulnerable in this regard.  An estimated 30% who have attempted suicide did not access mental health services, with cost, stigma and lack of understanding of LGBTI issues cited as the main barriers.  These barriers can and must be overcome.  These are the problems, most of which we already know about.  It is really important that the committee examines the gaps in access to health care for these groups of people, as well as looking at values.  Health planners need to hear the voices of these marginalised groups, who live with the effects of health inequality.<\/p> <p>  In my submission, I propose the establishment of a pilot version of NHS Citizen and Healthwatch UK and I would be happy to answer any questions members may have in that regard.  In addition, area-based, inclusive, stakeholder based health care planning forums should be established on a statutory basis for ongoing population planning.  These would allow the voice of the citizen to be heard loud and clear in the planning process.  I have seen at first hand in the UK how effective these can be.  When I was working on child care, each local authority area had to produce a plan that was informed by children, parents and others.  That plan was attached to targets and local authorities could not get funding until they submitted their plans.  I have seen how well such planning forums work.  The homeless forums that were set up in the early 2000s were also very effective.  However, such forums will come and go unless they are set up on a statutory basis and sometimes what is missing from them is the voice of those representing people with disabilities or dementia, for example.  These must be included in the forums and actively engaged with.  I know that GPs from the Carlow-Kilkenny model of care made a presentation to the committee recently about their version of a health care planning forum.  There are embryonic versions of these forums in existence already and they must be built upon.  This is a practical suggestion and, as I have said, I have seen them work.<\/p><p>It is based on the idea that one takes what one gets rather than what one needs or wants.  In many cases, availability of services are determined by a postcode lottery.  Regardless of whether citizens are living in Donegal or Donneraile and whether they have dementia, Down's syndrome or depression, they should be entitled to the same level of support that they require based on their needs at that particular time, and those needs may change.  The supports people need at the early onset of dementia are very different from the support they need at the later stage of dementia.  Supports need to travel with a person's needs as they develop.  <br\/><br\/>There is no clear vision or plan in the area of social care.  People working in the HSE, and people like myself who are on the other side, work hard but provision in this area is not coherent or joined up and it fails citizens.  It undermines people's dignity.  We were at the launch of the alliance of organisations supporting the call for home care provision.  Incontinence pads are now being rationed but that is not good enough and it is not necessary in a country like ours in this day and age.<br\/><br\/>Poor social care provision shortens lives and life expectancy.  Up to now key areas of social care have been left by the State to poorly funded and, sometimes, poorly governed charities.  As a result, very often citizens have to rely on services and supports which require fundraised income to operate.  There are well publicised examples of core services for vulnerable people being delivered by charitable organisations that can be under question.  Social care services for vulnerable people must be transparently commissioned, adequately funded and properly governed. <br\/><br\/>While I recognise that the State invests in social care, the existing spend is inflexible.  I was responsible for an organisation and had very little scope to innovate and change things in response to people's needs.  It was very fixed and tied up.  There is little room in the budget for the expansion of services or even innovation.  Of late, there has been some welcome moves towards personalised budgets in order that people can get control of their money and thereby decide what they want to do and how they want to spend it.  I have been appointed to a reference group in that regard.  On the whole, the budget needs examination and increases in key areas are also needed. <br\/><br\/>We should think of social care infrastructure as we would think of a transport system.  For an effective transport system to operate, we need all the parts to connect and work together.  We are unfortunately missing many pieces of the social care infrastructure.  I am sure my colleagues, Senators Dolan and Black, will expand on that.  Just as we are retrospectively joining up the Luas lines at huge cost and upheaval, we also need to join up the social care infrastructure to create webs of care.  In the long run, just as in the case of the Luas lines, it will be a worthwhile investment. <br\/><br\/>One key part of that infrastructure is home care.  A properly functioning home care system would and should serve people with a variety of support needs, including, but not exclusively, people with dementia.  To take the example of that group as I am close to it, there are currently 55,000 people with dementia in Ireland, 63% of whom live at home and want to live at home.  The national dementia strategy, co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies, promised to provide 500 home care packages, a modest enough expression in that strategy.  To date, only 72 people have benefited from those.  That is 72 out of 55,000 people.  According to the Department of Health, 25% of people in acute hospitals have dementia.  Keeping them in that setting makes no sense.  The national dementia strategy, just like A Vision for Change or Time to Move on From Congregated Settings and many other excellent plans in the social care sector, has become a victim of Ireland&rsquo;s implementation deficit disorder.  We have good policy but we do not implement it. <br\/><br\/>In one week in August there were 31 people in three hospitals, ready to be discharged, who were waiting on a home care package.  Over the course of the entire month of August only one home care package was provided in those hospitals.  As a result, there were 30 delayed discharges.  That is economic madness.  An intensive home care package costs only &euro;1,000 a week, while a stay in an acute hospital costs approximately &euro;1,000 a night.  If we scale that up over the year and across the State, the savings are significant.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, told the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week that there are currently 629 people whose medical care is complete who are still in hospital because other necessary care, support or accommodation has not been provided.  Remarkably, there has been a cut in the level of funding for  home care over in recent years in spite of the need for it.  Funding for it in the period from 2008 to 2015 has reduced by &euro;11 million.  That is despite the need, demand and unequivocal citizens' preference for it.  A study published by UCD, Age Action, The Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Irish Association of Social Workers incontrovertibly shows that people want to stay at home rather than being in other places.  Approximately 22,000 thousand people have signed The Alzheimer Society of Ireland's petition on home care, which signifies there is massive support for this.  <br\/><br\/>A similar picture could be painted in the area of people with disabilities, people with chronic conditions and older people.  The lack of home care and other social care provision has many knock-on effects.  People are too often forced to give up employment to take on caring duties full time.  This burden predominantly falls on women.  The 14% pay gap and 37% pension gap can be partly explained by women dropping out of paid work to take up caring duties because they simply had to do so.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Looking to the future, if we accept that the social care structures are not fit for purpose for today, the time for action is now.  We have an ageing population.  I have described what is happening in the here and now but matters will only get worse as our population ages.  We should be celebrating the fact that people are living longer and that people with Down's syndrome are living longer, but they do not have access to early onset dementia supports, which many people in that group may develop.  The fact that people are living longer is a cause for celebration, and not for angst, but we need to provide for them.  <br\/><br\/>We need a comprehensive plan for social care, underpinned by compassionate values and rights, and informed by population planning and health forums.  We need to dismantle old systems and shut down many of the institutions.  I accept this project may be beyond the scope of this committee, and it may require a committee or commission in its own right.  We must make it happen because if we do not adequately examine social care, all the rest of the work of this committee will be put in jeopardy.  As a crucial first step, over the lifetime of this Government, we could significantly invest in home care.  Such investment in home care must coincide with the introduction of robust regulation, a legal entitlement to guaranteed access and proper workforce planning.  We do not want to have people providing that care at the lowest level of care.  It is skilled work.  When I visited the Brothers of Charity in Liverpool, I learned that 90% of its workforce were on the minimum wage.  We need to do better than that for the people providing this skilled work and we know that it will result in long-term cost savings.  We know there is a demand from citizens and we know that it is key missing piece of the social care puzzle. <br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach said this week in the Seanad that he wants &quot;an Ireland that looks after its people from the time they come into the world to the time they leave&quot;.  A transformative investment in home care will go some way to making this vision a reality.  I thank the members for this invitation to appear before them and I welcome their questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#N00100","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Kelleher for her comprehensive presentation.

We were all delighted to come.  I want to speak on a specific issue of concern.  I have worked in the addiction area since 2003 during which time I have learned a great deal, particularly from family members, about the impact of harmful drinking on families and particularly on children.  We know that we have a huge problem with alcohol.  Three people a day are dying from an alcohol-related illnesses, which is scary.  Alcohol abuse costs the Exchequer &euro;800 million a year.  Approximately 1,500 hospital beds a day  are occupied by people with alochol-related illnesses.  Harmful drinking is a major issue.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about the hidden harm element.  The wide range of harms that are caused to children as a result of parental alcohol misuse is known as hidden harm.  As the harm is often not publicly visible, that means that those children are often not known to the appropriate services and they suffer harm in a number of important ways that can impede their physical, emotional and social development.<\/p><p>These children can suffer in silence and they often to do not know where to turn for help.  The impact of a parent's harmful drinking has a deep and long-lasting impact on their lives that may not fully emerge until young adulthood and beyond.  For a child, harmful parental drinking can shape their every moment from the time they wake up to the time they go to bed.  A child worries about whether his or her mam or dad will drink that day, what mood they will be in and whether he or she will go to bed hungry.<br\/><br\/>A child can take on the role of a parent in the family, making sure brothers and sisters are fed and getting them dressed and out to school.  In the most severe cases, a family situation can deteriorate to the extent where children are emotionally abandoned, physically or sexually abused or neglected with dirty nappies going unchanged and children going without regular meals.<br\/><br\/>I have conducted some research on this matter and found an amazing women called Dr. Stephanie Brown who works at Stanford University.  She talks about the developmental impact of parental alcohol misuse on children&rsquo;s attachment and identity formation and the impact of alcohol misuse related trauma on all aspects of development.  The earliest research emphasises the link between harmful parental drinking and mental health issues.  This is the area in which I am specifically interested.  We have found that children who are reared in homes where there is harmful drinking have a high rate of mental health issues and then we look at our suicide and addiction rates in Ireland.  Children can go on to have alcohol or substance misuse problems themselves.  Many researchers have found that children with parents who misuse alcohol can be more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, anti-social traits, relationship difficulties, behavioural problems and alcohol abuse themselves.<br\/><br\/>Children living with this trauma may develop a sense of self that is equated with defence.  These defences are designed to keep the enemy out and to minimise anxiety, fear and the threat of humiliation.  The defensive self or false self creates a deep sense of inauthenticity and a barrier to connectedness with others that exacerbates isolation and loneliness.  The defensive mantle tends to be brittle, inflexible and self-reinforcing, with the potential to break down under stress.<br\/><br\/>Over time this cumulative trauma can engender trauma related symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hyper-vigilance, low self-worth and somatic disturbances such as head and body aches, chronic tension and so forth.  It is shocking when one considers the evidence for all this.  These symptoms, if left untreated, can become full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.  They can lead to all sorts of life, learning, health, psychological and relationship complications and a desire to self-medicate.  This is how the insidious baton of addiction gets handed down through the generations.<br\/><br\/>The problematic use of alcohol and other drugs is a complex issue and continues to be one of the most significant health and social challenges facing society today.  Approximately one third of the people are engaged in harmful drinking.  I am not talking about addiction but a binge drinking culture.  This issue affects families and communities.  It can have serious implications for the welfare and safeguarding of children from conception and throughout their lives.  Children living with the everyday experience of the problematic use of alcohol may experience incipient or traumatic neglect, physical and emotional abuse, a lack of appropriate nurturing and adverse outcomes that may affect their adult lives.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to be repetitive so I will talk about what we can do to prevent this problem arising.  I have seen the effects of alcohol and substance abuse through the work that I have done, in particular with families.  Therefore, I know it is important that we have effective prevention and early intervention for children living in homes with alcohol or substance misuse.  The children who live with parents who have drug and alcohol problems are among the most vulnerable in society.  It is imperative that we ensure the best possible start in life for every child through effective prevention and early intervention.<br\/><br\/>We must also establish a holistic, recovery-based education and therapeutic programme for the adult children of alcoholics.  There is a successful programme in America and there is evidence available to prove how well it has succeeded.  The development and maintenance of a therapeutic alliance<b>, <\/b>or a quality treatment relationship based on mutual respect, is an essential component of effective treatment for individuals who are adult children of alcoholics.  Empathy, respect and belief in the individual's capacity for recovery are fundamental service provider attitudes and values.  Peer support and continuing care is also an option.<br\/><br\/>This issue should be recognised.  The culture of drinking in Ireland, particularly harmful drinking, has an impact on society in terms of mental health, addictions and physical harm.  There is an evidence piece in America called the adverse childhood experiences study or ACE for short.  It centres on the impact of dysfunction in the home and how it can have an impact on people on a physical level in the form of stress related illnesses like cancer and heart disease.  It is important to consider the future of health care and recognise that alcohol and substance abuse play a huge role in the lives of children.  The impact is not recognised in health care at the moment.  That is why funding should be made available for people who have been impacted by parental alcohol and substance misuse.  If we do so, it will prevent the legacy of mental health and addiction issues, and even physical health issues, that have been passed down through the generations.<br\/><br\/>There should be a consensus that integration between mental health and addiction services is sorely needed and long overdue.  Again, we can talk about dual diagnosis.  There is now a pressing need for transformation to recovery oriented care in both systems.  As my colleague, Senator Kelleher, has said, we must all work together to provide intervention services.  I hope I have not talked for too long and I am sorry if I did so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#O00500","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I wish to endorse the opening remarks made by Senator Kelleher on the valuable work done by this committee and the impetus it has given to a vital national issue.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to make a short presentation to the committee.  If people are confident that we have a robust and comprehensive health service, they will have the confidence to participate in the economic and social life of the country.  This matter is bigger than health care.  It has to do with having a sound fabric of health and active people in society, as best one can achieve doing so.<\/p> <p>  I will make a number of points that struck me having spent nearly four decades involved in the disability movement in one way or another.  Disability, disabling conditions and chronic illnesses are not discriminating in who they affect.  They cut across all areas of society: the young and old, people living in urban or rural regions, the well-off, those experiencing poverty and those who are close to poverty.  Therefore, disability is major issue for Ireland and is not a sectoral issue.  The health status of a population is critical to a society's economy, social development and achievements.<\/p> <p>  I have observed that what we now term as disability, and I include mental health, is very different from four decades ago.  It would be useful for me to refer to disabling conditions.  We know so much and advancements have been made in health systems, diagnostics and all the rest.  There are many conditions that can be kept under control by a range of treatments and whatever.  Therefore, we must realise that we are all on a continuum between being wholly healthy and having issues and some very severe issues with restricted ability and reduced functioning.  It is important that we realise there is no such thing as them and us.  It is a fact of life that we are all on that slope and we should not be upset about it either as it is life.<\/p> <p>  Some people are born with disabilities but they do not make up a huge number of the overall population.  Many people acquire disabilities over the course of their lives for a multitude of reasons such as injury, self-harm, lifestyle, a predisposition or what we might simply call, perhaps not too correctly, ageing.  Some people can suffer more than one condition.  For instance, there is a huge correlation between the number of people with Down's syndrome who will go on to develop a type of dementia.<\/p><p>We did not know that 30 years ago because previously these folk did not live past 30 years of age.  It is to be celebrated that they are living into their 40s, 50s and 60s, but we are wrong if we do not plan for people having longer lives and the other things that can happen to them.  While people with disabilities and disabling conditions are a minority of the overall population, they are a majority in the use of health services.  It is not just a numbers game.  Some people rely on health services more than others, and people at a certain point in their lives certainly will.<\/p><p> Advances in information, knowledge, technology, treatments, earlier diagnosis and understanding of causal factors shape the environment in which we now operate.  I believe we are not fully, or anywhere near, exploiting the opportunities and potential which all of these bring.  There are still crazy situations where somebody almost uses a pigeon to take a letter from one place in the health services to somebody else.  We are not exploiting simple things such as communications technology and the like.  An improved health service will mean more people will survive birth, which is a good thing, but we must accept that there will be some babies and children with severe and complex needs.  Let us face that fact and plan for it.  In addition, as I mentioned already, people with such conditions will live longer.  The complexity of health needs to be catered for will clearly also increase.  These are issues we will have to accept as side effects of something that is good, which is more people being born and more people with disabilities being able to survive them and live longer, and confront that.<\/p><p> The future of health services must focus on, and invest strongly in, the areas of prevention, early intervention and amelioration, and the committee heard Senator Black speak about that in a particular context.  If we do that, it can help to dampen further demand on health services.  Getting in early and supporting people is the smart thing to do, even from an economic point of view.  More generally, the current structures and delivery systems of services and the way society thinks about disability and chronic illnesses exacerbate rather than alleviate the associated problems.  Our approach to how we plan services and think about things is dysfunctional and very unhelpful.  Services must be remoulded so that every person, in so far as possible, is able to self-manage and have a sense of control over their condition and living circumstances.  Health professionals must be better able to optimise working in partnership with people, their families, support networks and the groups that work with them.  Primary and community care infrastructure is critical to all of this.<\/p><p> Beyond that, it must be recognised that the success of the health and care services in supporting and responding to disability and disabling conditions is significantly dependent on factors outside of the health service.  That is one of the shifts in mindset that is required.  Events outside of the health arena have a huge impact.  I recall meeting a man 36 or 37 years ago, who I still know, who is physically disabled and in a wheelchair.  He could not push himself around and did not have a motorised wheelchair.  He went to a special school and graduated from there to a special workshop in the same organisation.  I lost contact with him over a number of decades, but now he has a motorised wheelchair.  He lives on the north side of Dublin.  Dublin Bus and the bus stops became accessible.  We take the use of public transport for granted, but that meant he could get from his home to any place around the city when and how he wished.  He could get to his place of training.  In fact, during that time he re-trained with the support of the organisation.  He went to a college of further education that was accessible and near to him.  There are a number of fortunate accidents here, and that is what we do not need because we must create the situation so this can happen.  That man is now employed in that organisation.  Little things, such a decent motorised wheelchair under his bum, an accessible public transport system and accessible spatial infrastructure, trebled and quadrupled the value of the supports he was receiving.  That is what can be won here.<\/p><p> Accessible and available transport, including public transport, accessible public buildings and spaces, accessible information or information in accessible formats for people who are blind, deaf or have other conditions, good and appropriate housing, access to education, training and employment and sufficient income are equally as important as focusing on the health and care side.  Both must be progressed if one wishes to maximise the results and returns.  These areas must be planned for and improved in tandem with the health and personal social services.  Every Department and public body has a role to play in creating the tapestry that will optimise the health and well-being of all of our people and maximise the participation of people with disabilities and disabling conditions.  The health and well-being of all is a core matter for all of the Government, not solely for the Department of Health and the HSE.  We can criticise the latter, and I am sure we will continue to do so, but it is and has been wrong to see all of the issues as being in the health area.  The other aspects, such as education, training and access, are pieces of the jigsaw that have not been playing their part.<\/p><p> In conclusion, disability is not a sector in Ireland.  We are all going in that direction and if we are not, our loved ones are.  Nobody escapes this in one way or another.  Consider it as making Ireland open to the broad spectrum of its people as they are and as they will be.  It will be a very hopeful situation if we can do that.  A small matter on which I have been working is the departmental strategy statements.  It is important to get something into them, when they are being compiled under the new Ministers, related to this agenda of access for people with disabilities and disabling conditions.  Every Department has something valuable to offer here.  Rather than them saying they will see if they can do a special programme, the ambition must be to ensure that everybody can participate as they are, regardless of the shape they are in and their abilities.<\/p><p> There are three elements.  What happens outside of the Department of Health is as important and in some ways more important, because that is where one gets the multipliers and the real outcomes for people to be able to live.  People with disabilities, their families and support groups should be supported and encouraged to be more at the centre of managing, controlling and being on top of their lives.  Third is prevention and early intervention.  There is no doubt that when we started slapping people with penalty points and raised their insurance costs fewer people died, thankfully, and many other people did not become disabled, with their families caught up in that, who otherwise would have.  That is because of something that was done somewhere else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#P00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the three witnesses for their comprehensive presentations.<\/p><p>The committee is very pleased to have the benefit of the group's experience and expertise on the front line.

What does she recommend to make the sector more coherent and accountable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#Q00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I have worked for charities both in Ireland and in the UK.  Charities have stepped into the breach when the State has failed, but very often the State needs to take up where the charities began.  Very often they have had to carry on and carry the can because the State has not been able to step in or take up its role.  Charities have a great role to play in advocacy and innovation, but whether they continue to be a main provider will depend on the charity.  A good commissioning framework is the way to deal with it.  Charities are as good as what they can deliver to people.  The confusion has arisen because charities have been advocates and have suddenly become providers.  Some are well intentioned but not geared up to be the kinds of providers we need in a regulated and standards environment.  Good commissioning but not a race to the bottom commissioning is the way it will be dealt with.  It can be seen in the UK.  Charities are coming and going based on what the consumer needs.  Without a charitable sector in Ireland, some people would have nothing.  It is now time to take stock, say the situation is historic and ask what the citizen needs.  If a charity, private provider or the State can provide these services, it should be the right way to go about it.

I often think, and the articles I quoted by Mintzberg support this, that a lot of time can be spent getting into structures, reorganisations, new logos and new this, that and the other, and this takes away from the energy of doing the work because at the end of the day, whatever the size of the population, people have to work together.<\/p> <p>  The new community health care organisations are a good starting point.  It causes some amusement that community health care organisation area 4 looks a lot like the Southern Health Board of old, so we will kind of go back to the future.  I would not get too caught up in that.  They need to be sufficiently localised to connect with people.  They should not be too remote.  Within a community health care organisation, there could be clusters but the voice of the citizen has to be active and not just an afterthought.  It should be driving them and having these kinds of conversations directly with commissioners and providers of organisations.<\/p> <p>  That is what the NHS Citizen project is about.  It is about enabling the citizen, provider and commissioner to have these conversations.  Very often when we have the citizen meeting the health provider, it is in a situation of frustration and anger.  Those conversations are very understandable but they often do not go anywhere because the provider gets entrenched and hides away or the citizen is so cross they cannot bear to talk.

There needs to be new ways of working in order that those kinds of different groups can converse with each other.  It is equally an issue with the professions.

In each of the Senators' area of expertise, do they see the issue as one of resource and financing or does it comprise organisational issues?  Perhaps it is a combination of both.  If there was enough finance and resources in the morning, do the Senators believe they could do what they need to?

The organisation and culture issues cannot be underestimated and neither can the inflexibility of the systems.  Expenditure on social care services for people with disabilities is &euro;1.5 billion but it is very tied up.  If people say they want services delivered differently, it is extraordinarily difficult to do that in response to them.  We might have the same amount of money we want to spend differently but it is extremely difficult because of the way the systems operate.  There are shortfalls as well.  If one looks at the annual report of Cork Simon Community, where I worked for eight years, it shows that it has to fund-raise half the money it needs every year to support 1,000 people in the city.  There is a funding shortfall there.  Services and supports for people who are homeless in the city should not be reliant on the kindness of people.  They should be on a stronger footing than that.<\/p> <p>  It is great when people are generous.  I was very grateful when I was working in that organisation because it allowed us to do certain things.  One of the things we did was walk-in counselling.  Very often people with addictions could not access counsellors because they had to be sober.  People were not going to become sober overnight, yet they had to make that leap.  We innovated in that way with walk-in counselling.  Someone might not be able to wait three weeks for an appointment.  They might need to see a counsellor at the time.  That is an example.  It is an organisational and cultural issue but there are also big resourcing gaps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#R00800","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":272,"content":"<p>That is very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#R00900","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>What is Senator Dolan's view on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#R01000","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to a combination of resourcing, financing and organisational issues.  It is beyond that.  I am not saying these are not issues, however.  We are being wasteful by not coming at this from a different perspective.  We keep talking about the cost of everything and we are rationing all the time.  I accept cost is an issue but we have to get our heads - our spirits - into a place where we have two choices.  We either let these people wither and die or we do what has to be done over a period to ensure they can participate fully in society.  That means getting back to some things and opening another front on prevention and early intervention, while drawing people, families and their support groups into the work and getting a more genuine partnership.<\/p> <p>  Services have been sliced and diced and it is said this is the way they will be provided.  That is more and more madness.  Yes, people need a roof over their heads and they need people to help them in residential settings and to have activities.  Why are we looking at day programmes as the standard and not asking why are these people not migrating into activities in the community, work and jobs or whatever?  It needs to be approached that way and that one starts migrating from the dysfunctional approach we have.<\/p> <p>  To be a charity, the test is that one has to be regarded as a public benefit.  All of the organisations that are part of the State are there because they are considered to be a public benefit.  Now one has not got the State and the charities at two ends of the spectrum.  What one has is a different governance.  The HSE, Health Service Executive, is a creature of the State, as well as all the other public bodies.  An organisation that sets itself up is a creature of the people who set it up.  Article 40 of the Constitution gives people the right to set up organisations and unions.  That is a basic democratic principle.<\/p> <p>  Recently, I was at some meetings with colleagues from Poland and Hungary who are quite concerned about the shrinking of the civil society space.  That does not give licence to not being a good well-organised or well-governed entity, however.  There are many smaller organisations which get little or modest funds from the State.  They might be dealing with people with a particular condition, of which there may not be a significant number.  They need to create a brand or public awareness around that condition to ensure people who get a diagnosis of that particular condition will come to them.  They also need it to be able to raise funds and operate in the public sphere to create further awareness.<\/p> <p>  There are complexities around this.  In the private sector, there is legislation to stop company amalgamations because they might not be good for competition.  We need to look at this.  What about the idea of autonomy and choice?  There has been a blossoming of smaller organisations around mental health, neurological issues, local groups and suicide prevention.  There is a tension between the benefit of keeping it at a tidy number and the benefit of allowing 20 groups create a head of steam about a certain condition.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman said the charities area is quite a problematic one and there needs to be more cohesion and accountability.  That could be said of the whole spectrum of State services, private businesses and voluntary organisations.  I am in the Disability Federation, an umbrella organisation for 130 groups, some of which are very large and significant direct service providers.  It might be like church-run schools where there is a time when an organisation goes from being on the edge and providing a service no one else is to becoming funded and core-supported.  There is a time to relook at that.<\/p> <p>  For the other ones, it is more about how we can put in back offices and get them to work in tandem.  Take three organisations dealing with children who have similar conditions.  It would make sense that they would not all be trying to have someone in Cork and Kerry to visit the children they deal with.<\/p> <p>  We went down a road in the early noughties to deal with and improve governance in organisations.  It was very hard to get any interest from the State.  We only woke up to the idea of governance when the banks went wallop.  Understandably, we have been very strongly on the side of compliance since.  The other side of governance is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  That states all of Ireland has to dance to a particular tune to ensure people with disabilities can be included.  This can become the hook for us to have hard conversations, not just with Departments but with organisations, that this is not just about the organisation or agency on its own anymore but that this must be moved on at a societal level.  I am not going to defend poor and wrongful practices because they harm people with disabilities.  I know that so well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#S00100","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Senator Colette Kelleher made an important distinction between advocacy groups and service providers.

I can only talk about the experience I have had in the charity sector working with the RISE Foundation, which I set up myself, and the lack of resources we have had.  We provide a service for family members who have a loved one with an alcohol, drug or gambling problem.  Many of these families are in serious crisis with serious mental health issues, particularly partners, mothers, fathers who are suffering horrendously with anxiety and depression.  When they come to the RISE Foundation, they are in absolute crisis.  We have never received any funding from anybody.  We have 50 people attending our service this week alone and all 50 of those service users are in absolute crisis.  We have started to partner up with other organisations, such as the addiction service Turas in Dundalk, and the Family Support Network.  We really believe in partnering with other organisations.<\/p> <p>  I can only talk about that experience and apologise if I am not answering the committee's questions.<\/p><p>I can only speak about the lack of resources and how extremely passionate I am about being a voice for the families in question.

We all are here to learn.  It seems clear to me that what is lacking in the system are empathy, education, support, equality and inclusion.  Senator Black referred to dual diagnosis, which is a new development.  Surely, in 2016, we should have got to the point where we know what is required in terms of empathy and education and the supports that should be in place.  Unfortunately, the entire system is fractured.  Senator Dolan observed that it is not all to do with the health service, that we must also look to social inclusion.  It is about people getting out in the world and making approaches.  Many people with disabilities are not sick.  We must ensure they have the best quality of life we can provide by focusing on equality and inclusion.  A simple step to implement would be the provision of streetscapes on all main streets, ensuring they are wheelchair accessible, there is the correct colour code and so on.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Colette Kelleher that certain groups continue to be excluded.  Again, this usually comes down to a lack of education.  The Traveller community suffers a great deal in this regard.  The extremely high suicide rates in that community are not being reported properly and many Traveller families have been let down.  LGBT people have also suffered but, fortunately, through education and inclusion, people are getting their stories out.<\/p> <p>  Returning to Senator Black's point about dual diagnosis, it comes down to three factors, namely, education, empathy and support.  Each person is an individual with specific needs and should be treated as such.  There is always an underlying problem in these cases and it is vital to identify that problem as soon as possible instead of allowing it to fester until the person eventually presents for help.  GPs have a vital role in this regard and we should be seeking to nip these issues in the bud at primary care level.  The greatest problem in this area is that there does not seem to be a consensus on how to proceed.  We remain a cure society when we should be a preventative society, even though we would likely spend three times less if we looked to prevent rather than cure.<\/p> <p>  I commend the witnesses on their contribution.

That article is the basis from which I made a good living and is an issue about which I feel very strongly.  I would like to explore the journey from advocacy to service provision.  I am not sure I share all the Senator's views on the role of the State in this regard but I recognise that there is a replication in the charities sector.  Senator Dolan will correct me if I am wrong but it certainly seems to me, as an observer, that there is a problem of duplication to be addressed.  Many of the criticisms of our health and social care services revolve around their silo nature whereby A does not talk to B, and B, in turn, does not talk to C.  There are multiple charitable and voluntary organisations dealing in the same area.  Without wanting to stymie their advocacy function, which is incredibly important, I would like to know what scope there is for co-operation between charities.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colette Kelleher spoke about the limitations that are sometimes placed on service provision.  Without meaning to put words in anybody's mouth, I wonder whether that is because of the mechanism for service level agreements.  I suspect people are given a tenner and told to do &euro;50 worth of work with it.  Again, there are multiple agencies and a great deal of replication because the governance and administrative systems have to be in place.  That can create a difficulty.  It seems some charities suffered more than others in terms of cutbacks because they simply did not have a buffer.  Smaller organisations, in particular, have felt that pinch considerably.  I am interested to hear any observations the Senator might have in regard to service level agreements.  It is the model that seems to be driving most provision.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the good work Senator Black does in the area of dual diagnosis.  The Government sector, including the HSE, is not doing enough - if it is doing anything - to address the issues in this regard.  There must be a link-in with mental health services.  I am interested to explore the extent to which there is a difficulty in this respect given there is largely no recognition of dual diagnosis despite the general acceptance that it is an important issue which needs to be dealt with.  I am wondering about the extent to which charities can shape policy, including, but not solely, in respect of the issue of dual diagnosis.  Or is the policy of charities mostly driven by the funding that is available to them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#T00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing the start of the meeting and thank the witnesses for their contributions.  From a broader perspective, we are talking about trying to develop a health strategy for the country for the next ten years.  That is the purpose of this committee.  In that context, the role of the charities and advocacy sector and how it should fit into the broader model is an important issue for discussion.  We all tend to look to the State to do everything in the area of health care provision but it is important to recognise the very important role for civic society in this regard and the need to encourage continued charitable giving.  This can be done by giving of one's time, service and support or via donation.  The charitable instinct is a noble attribute which we should encourage in our society.  We must not, however, have a situation where society is totally dependent on charity, with the State abdicating its responsibility.<\/p> <p>  There is a large number of advocacy groups working, with varying levels of success, on particular campaigns and to raise awareness of specific illnesses and diseases.  Some of these organisations move from advocacy to service provision, which is where things become more complex.  In the area of counselling or disability, for example, how does one encourage as much effort as possible while also ensuring the service being provided gives the best clinical outcomes for individuals?  There is a need for clarity on this question of the regulation of services.<\/p> <p>  Another important question is how we can build the work of charities into the primary care sector.<\/p><p>I do not wish to pre-empt the work of the committee but primary care is certainly viewed by most people and most expert groups and organisations as the way to deliver health care in the years ahead so that we keep chronic illness out of hospitals and deal with most things in the primary care setting.  How can we complement charities working with primary care and broader community services?  Meals on Wheels is an example.  It is a very simple concept but it is a very important issue in Ireland where people give of their time to give meals to people who need them.  It is more than just the nutritional value; it is the contact.  The issue concerns complementing or supplementing that with home help hours with the public health nurse feeding in.  Where do the witnesses see the charitable sector fitting with State services in a co-ordinated way that does not stymie individuals who want to set up charities or advocacy groups?

As well as the commissioners, which are the HSE, and citizens, one has the organisations that are concerned or involved.  They could be advocacy or service delivery organisations and sometimes they are both.  The Cork city homeless forum was a brilliant example of that in the noughties.  The HSE, Cork City Council and the organisations sat around the table and planned very coherent services.  One group was missing, namely, homeless people, and that would need to be corrected.  By 2011, there were enough beds for everybody sleeping rough in the city so the forum was very effective.  It was not on a statutory basis so it could come and go.<\/p> <p>  Those kinds of planning forums involve people working together at a local level.  The Carlow-Kilkenny model is good, except that one does not find the patients or the charities in there working together.  Each has different roles to play and everything does not have to be done by professionals, as sometimes a volunteer can be involved.  If someone is living in a residential setting and fancies going to a match on a Sunday, he or she does not need someone with a nursing qualification to do that.  It involves those kinds of groups working together, while being driven by the person and citizen rather than the vested interest of, for example, the charity that has always done this work in this way or the professional who must leave a shift at 8 p.m. so everybody has to go to bed at 7 p.m.  It is about turning the planning and delivery of services on its head so that it is focused on what the person needs.<\/p> <p>  All the different actors need to play their part.  If charities serve the citizen in advocacy or in providing services, support or volunteerism, they have a role to play and if they do not, they do not have a role.  The restrictive practices piece does not just relate to charities.  It relates to shift working and working in different ways so that it meets the needs of the person.  It is not just about the \"stuck-ness\" of the system we have.  Practices cut across the different interest groups.  The professions and charities are in there with their stake but those stakes have to serve the person.  There is a unique opportunity to turn things on their head. <\/p> <p>  The service-level agreements mentioned by Deputy O'Reilly are very rigid and restrictive.  There is no doubt that, most of the time, organisations with them deliver more than they are paid to do.  There also is an opportunity to look at those in terms of expecting good governance and public accountability from the charities.  I am interested in the debate about the national maternity hospital and the arguments between two different groups.  Service-level agreements are ways those groups could be forced into because at the end of the day, it is for the State.  However, the State often underfunds those agreements. <\/p> <p>  Regardless of whether it involves a provider, a commissioner or a person working on the front line, unless empathy is at the heart of all this and we do what we do kindly and properly and do not get disassociated from the person at the centre of all of this, none of it matters.  That point was very well made by Deputy Buckley.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#U00300","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>A number of members raised the issue of dual diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FUH2016100500002#U00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I am very concerned about this area because we are aware of the relationship between alcohol, drugs and even gambling and mental health and how they are so closely linked.

My concern is they are not really under the umbrella of mental health, which plays such a huge role.  I know a new youth task force has been set up by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and it is a fantastic idea.  However, my concern is that nobody on that task force is talking about dual diagnosis or the role of alcohol, drugs or gambling and young people.  I know that gambling in particular has gone off the Richter scale because there is such easy access to it on the Internet.  From a mental health and addiction point of view, people need to work together.  The issue needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The services around addiction are atrocious.  There are no services specifically for alcohol on the west coast, which is shocking.  Again, I return to the fact that three people a day die from an alcohol-related illness.

It is a case of people saying there does not seem to be a door they have knocked on that has the answer for them, so they will get going on it.<\/p> <p>  From my experience across the broad sector, I get caught up in definitions.  Is giving somebody support, advice or contact information a service?  I think it is but often when we talk about services, we are actually talking about the hard services and very often the ones that cost the State a lot of money to provide.  There is a continuum.  In terms of advocacy, support, a place to first listen to somebody and say \"this will be all right.

That is important.  How do we ensure such an organisation would provide very hard services around the clock?  I do not know if that helps in some way.  There is a continuum between the private and public entities.  There are different ways for the State to ensure the services, as it can carry them out or make arrangements for them.

The education of kids is the education of all kids, employment is for all and public transport and income supports are for all.  The health sector must get its mojo going and stop being on the back foot all the time.  The Health Service Executive could start to warehouse people for the rest of their lives or instead other Departments and entities could get a move on in considering how to get involved.  That is whether people are involved full-time, part-time, in jobs or community activities etc.  That relates to the prevention aspect mentioned by Deputy Buckley.

If a family has capacity, whether there are one or two parents, regardless of issue, the doctor or voluntary and State organisations do not get put under pressure.

Specifically, the briefing material is intended to help the joint committee in considering the performance of the Department measured against its own output targets, whether emerging pressures are likely to impact significantly on its performance and spending in the remainder of the year, whether there is likely to be a significant underspend or overspend before year end and whether any significant policy decision taken this year will impact on the 2017 Estimates for the Department.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that the Minister will be invited to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.

The upcoming budget is another stepping stone in our plan to build a strong economy that sets out to create a fair and compassionate society in which everybody will have the chance to succeed and nobody will be left behind and where we will measure ourselves by our national well-being rather than national income.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, in June we injected a further &euro;40 million into the justice Vote, an increase of more than 6% on the corresponding Revised Estimate for 2015.  The expenditure position in a detailed review of the performance measures set out in the Revised Estimates covered the period 2014 to 2016.  It was recently provided for the committee and I hope that document and the subsequent exchanges of correspondence and briefing material have proved useful to members.  <\/p> <p>  The eight Estimates in the justice Vote group comprise a total gross expenditure budget of &euro;2.4 billion in 2016, of which &euro;2.3 billion is current expenditure and &euro;158 million is capital expnditure.  More than 63% of this expenditure relates to the Garda Vote, while less than 1% relates to the justice Department.  They are smaller but vitally important roles which we have often discussed here in the Policing Authority, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and other bodies,   As the committee knows, the budget covers a vast range and scale of programmes and expenditure areas.  I will outline some of the key changes in the data provided for the period up to the end of June.  I will comment in so far as I can on my priorities for budget 2017 and discuss performance-related information.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned previously, an important development to be noted is that in the Revised Estimates Volume published in June the Government provided an additional &euro;40 million in Exchequer funding for the Garda Vote in response to the unprecedented challenges faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year.  Let me reiterate that the Government has consistently made it clear that we will fund whatever measures are needed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges it faces.  In terms of performance, I will focus on the impact the funding available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is having.  <\/p> <p>  A number of targeted Garda operations have been established and resourced by the Government in response to violent crime in Dublin and to address public concerns about community safety.  As of last month, for example, there had been 40 arrests and five charges brought in connection with the recent shootings.  In addition, the Garda has seized 22 firearms and conducted more than 8,000 lines of enquiry.  There have been in excess of 11,520 high-visibility checkpoints.  It is important that the committee note this information.  The measures have been implemented with significant support from the armed support unit.  Of course, there was a huge response from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who wanted to be part of the newly established unit, the members of which have been selected and are in training.  We have them looking at a significant amount of CCTV footage, as well as mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence, all of which is being examined.  The close co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Spanish police led to the recent arrest of a suspect in Spain, as well as to search operations targeting criminal activities in Ireland and Spain.<\/p> <p>  I turn to Operation Thor which began in 2015 and is focused on tackling burglaries and related crimes.<\/p><p> Operation Thor, beginning in 2015 and focused on burglary and related crime, is an example of the Government's response to crime in both rural and urban areas.  It has two key objectives: strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders - we brought in new legislation last year to provide for consecutive sentencing; and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively.<\/p><p> Operation Thor has provided a swift return on the Government's investment in Garda resources and this is reflected in the recently released official recorded crime statistics published by the CSO.  Of course, there is an ongoing programme.  I met the CSO early after the inspectorate report was published to discuss the importance of having absolute reliability in the figures.  It has an ongoing programme of examination of those figures to ensure that they meet its high standards.  As I say, I met the CSO, discussed that and that programme is under way.  The figures on Operation Thor show that for the first three months of this year, there were 36% less burglaries than in the first three months of 2015.<\/p><p> These CSO statistics provide a clear measure of the success of Garda strategy under Operation Thor.  There has been concentrated police activity throughout the country, including more than 30,000 crime prevention patrols, 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide, 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges, covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p><p> In the material provided, I brought to the attention of the committee that we plan to bring forward a technical Supplementary Estimate to provide a further &euro;15 million to the Garda Vote from savings elsewhere in the justice sector to complete the additional funding package to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before the end of the year.  In the context of the technical Supplementary Estimate, it is likely - based on expenditure trends to date - that capital expenditure will be reallocated within the Garda Vote and between the prisons and Courts Service Votes to provide for additional capital expenditure in the courts.  Prisons will also benefit from this investment as it includes the provision of additional video link facilities in courts thus reducing prison transport costs.  These reallocations are the result of close co-operation across the sector.<\/p><p> I will provide the members with more information on these proposals when I return later in the year in regard to the technical Supplementary Estimates.  I stress there is no additional Exchequer funding involved, just prudent use of available resources and more effective management of the capital allocation on a multi-annual basis.<\/p><p> I will turn now to the 2017 Estimates process which is well advanced at this stage given that budget day is less than a week away.  Members will also appreciate that a key aspect of any budgetary and Estimates process is that no details are released until the whole package is agreed by Government and announced on budget day.<\/p><p> Of course, I have shared some of my priority areas in correspondence with the committee and I will reiterate a number of the main requirements I am seeking to reflect in the Estimates 2017 for my own Department, including accelerated Garda recruitment - this remains a priority and it is a commitment in the programme for Government.  We have also said, in order to get more effective management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to continue the reform programme, that we need to recruit more civilians.   I want to see this happening next year and I am looking for a budgetary allocation for that.  I am also looking for increased funding and, indeed, staffing for important areas that come under the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, such as the Charities Regulator.  We all are aware of the various issues that have been raised about the charities sector in the past year and the increasing governance issues that must be dealt with by the Charities Regulator, and I want to ensure that it has the resources to do that work.  Obviously, data protection remains an ever more important issue.  This week I met the CEO of Microsoft.  We have considerable investment, from that company and from other industries, here and the approach of this Government to data protection is critical.  Funding to maintain policing operations targeting gangland and other serious crime remains an important focus for us in the budget for the future and in the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na next year.<\/p><p> In regard to additional capital expenditure, if finances permit, I would like to bring forward expenditure to 2017 to allow for the commencement of a new forensic science laboratory.  This would mean that this important capital project will be completed in 2019 rather than commencing in that year as originally provided for in the capital plan.  Everybody recognises the importance of having new appropriate facilities for forensic science in terms of the prosecution of crime and evidence building.<\/p><p> Finally, before I conclude I will comment briefly on the linkage of performance measures to the Revised Estimates which is an important development, no doubt the process can be improved and we all have a part to play.<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a revised approach to performance measurement in the context of the 2017 policing plan.  The Policing Authority has a significant interest in this also and will have input into this process.  Similarly, my Department's working group on efficiency measures in the criminal justice system has also set the development of performance indicators in order to measure the output of the various efficiency measures, as one of its priority objectives over the coming months.  There is no shortage of data but the availability of more consistent data across the criminal justice area is a priority area for my Department.  Of course, the development of IT and inter-operable IT systems remains a big challenge, but one that must be met if we are to have a more effective justice system.  We want to do this in a structured and collaborative way, with the benefits outweighing the cost of providing the information because IT is expensive and the end product realising the objective of better information that can guide both policy and criminal investigation and prosecution.  This will support and enable the work of policy makers, the important oversight role of Oireachtas Members and ensure that the taxpayers' resources are being used in a constructive way.  On that note, I will conclude for now.  Obviously, I look forward to hearing the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#A00500","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

That was highlighted by it.  It reminds me that I gave the Minister evidence of the massaging of crime figures in the Athlone area almost a year ago but I never heard back from her.  The Minister acknowledged it but I did not hear anything since, unless I missed it.<\/p> <p>  On all these measures, I can see the rationale behind what is happening here.  It is well-intentioned, but as long as the top hierarchy of the organisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains as dysfunctional as it is, a lot of this is merely aspirational.  We are aware of the fact that this has probably been brought home strongly to the Minister by the document that landed on her desk on Monday morning last which, I am sure she will aware, is fairly frightening.  At this stage, if the Minister really wants to make these aspirations that she has discussed here this morning a reality, should she not first deal with the fact that we need new leadership in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  We do not need another investigation.  We do not need any more inquiries.

I have a keen interest in them myself because I want the public to have as much confidence as possible in the statistics that are published.  I said that when the first Garda Inspectorate report on crime statistics was delivered, I initiated contact with the CSO, which is an independent body and which had an interest in doing this anyway, and I asked its officials to put a process in place to make sure the figures that were published were as robust as possible because it is essential that we have accurate and reliable data on crime.  We want to ensure the policing services provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are responsive to emerging crime trends and we want to keep the public fully informed.  It was only in June 2015 that the CSO published its first crime data quality report.  The most recent report highlights progress in addressing a range of issues since then, many of which were originally examined in 2014.  It also says there is need for ongoing improvements.  I accept that, as do the Garda and the CSO.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the reliability of crime data is a big issue in many jurisdictions and not just this country.  This is an international issue and the key point is we are taking steps to address it, which is important.  I welcome the fact that the CSO concluded that the estimated impact on the issues identified in respect of recorded crime is substantially less than was the case in the first review, but Deputy Wallace is correct that we need to keep a strong focus on this.  It is a work in progress and there have been improvements to the PULSE system, including the recording of investigations.  The clear directions internally are to clearly record crimes that are reported.  Crimes are being investigated.  Recording is a separate issue but we have to have both.  It will take time for the full effect of upgrading Garda systems to be reflected in the crime statistics.<\/p> <p>  I remain committed to this work and that is reflected in the allocation of &euro;205 million to this area in the 2016 to 2021 capital plan.  There is ongoing discussion, both at national and international level, about improving recording and the interoperability of various recording systems.  While this work goes on, CSO officials are satisfied that they are in a position to continue to publish crime statistics and the need for improvement in this area should not distract from the comparative assessment of the statistics, which shows a real and consistent improvement under a number of headings.  I want the figures to be as accurate as possible and a process is under way.  The CSO, which is a reliable, objective, independent body, is monitoring this on an ongoing basis and in the publication of crime statistics over the coming years, I expect to see a closer connection between what the CSO demands in terms of the highest standards and the way the figures are published.  It is a work in progress but there has been an improvement.  <\/p> <p>  I will not go into the detail about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but we have a five year reform and high level workforce plan and that will be important as a vehicle for reform.  Significant work has been done throughout the organisation through a modernisation and renewal programme.  The Policing Authority has an important role in monitoring that.  We set up the authority in order that it would discuss the programme of reform with the Garda authorities in respect of priority areas and the strategic plan for each year.  Almost 1,000 recommendations were made in the Garda Inspectorate reports and work is under way to implement them.<\/p> <p>  I will try to be as helpful I can to the committee in response to reports that have appeared publicly about recent protected disclosures relating to the treatment of whistleblowers.  The committee should recognise I have real difficulties commenting on the matter.  Others may be free to comment.  I want to ensure we have a just and fair approach to this issue.  What I have is a body of allegations that have come through protected disclosures.  I am bound by the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  I have to take every step to ensure the confidentiality of the whistleblowers.  Whatever is out there in the public arena is out there but I have a duty as Minister.  The Act is clear about my legal obligations and about the legal obligations on the person to whom a protected disclosure is made.  Earlier this week, I received correspondence from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Act.  I cannot for obvious reasons go into the detail but I assure the committee that I am carefully assessing and considering the appropriate response to those disclosures and how they can best be dealt with and I will consider in great detail how to respond to them and what is the best possible way to take this further to make sure a process is in place to analyse the detail of that body of allegations.  However, I will certainly do it in a way that protects the whistleblowers and that is fair and is seen to deliver justice to all.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan asked a number of questions about recruitment.  Subject to the outcome of the Estimates process, I expect that a further 800 trainees will be recruited in 2017 in order that we can arrive at the point where there will be 15,000 members in the Garda over the next few years.  There will be approximately 1,200 trainees in place at the end of 2016.  The recent competition for recruits to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na closed last Friday.  There was a report that 1,600 members of the public had applied but the correct figures is more than 5,000.  A review of the Garda Reserve is being undertaken.  A superintendent has been given responsibility for the development of the reserve force and the review is nearing conclusion.  I expect that recruitment to the reserve will begin mid-year.  The goal is to double its numbers.  The recruitment of more civilians is central to the reform programme and we have included it as a commitment in the programme for Government.  It is again subject to the Estimates process but I hope several hundred civilians can be recruited next year to make sure jobs that can more effectively be done by civilians are done by them.  In some instances, this will release garda&iacute; for front-line duties; in other instances, this will support the Garda's work.<\/p><p>In other instances, it will support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#C00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Can I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#D00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I was going to come back to the Deputy, in deference to other members-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#D00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>No problem.

Ms Josephine Feehily was before the committee last week, as the Minister is aware, and she outlined the collaborative co-operation ongoing between her authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does the Minister believe it is appropriate that the Policing Authority is engaging in workshops and an active collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the creation of the policing plan when it is also the body that provides oversight and monitoring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  With regard to their autonomy, is it appropriate for both organisations to have a cloud over them in terms of the creation of the policing plan?  That is a core issue of governance.  There are only 13 staff in the Policing Authority.  The chair of the Policing Authority did not outline to me the Chinese walls that exist within that authority to ensure that the people who are monitoring, reviewing and providing the oversight are not also guiding the Garda in its policing plan.  As the authority is established and progressed, it is important we ensure that proper governance mechanisms are in place so that we have that system of oversight.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the current Garda dispute.  There are significant morale issues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and others have outlined that to the Minister.  What does she expect to occur in that regard, and how does she hope the dispute will be resolved?  With new and probationary garda&iacute; on disgraceful starting salaries, it is fundamental that the Minister acts there is hope for new garda&iacute; as they enter the force.<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, technology.  Investment in that technology has been stagnant over the past two or three years.  In 2014, 116 cars were fitted with ANPR, and about 100 so far this year.  That is a fundamental technological tool and it is important there is further investment in it.  I hope the Minister will incorporate that in her budgetary Estimates.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to a debate I had with the Minister last week.  I welcome the &euro;40 million additional investment this year because of the current issues in our city.  Currently, there is a temporary presence there but in terms of the Minister's own initiative, I ask her to ensure there is a permanent replacement of community garda&iacute;, whose numbers have been haemorrhaging in recent years.  That is a priority, and we must get an assurance on that.<\/p> <p>  My final question reiterates an issue Deputy Wallace mentioned.  In her initial contribution, the Minister praised the garda&iacute; and said that the number of burglaries are down by 36%.  I agree the garda&iacute; are doing good work, but the Minister cannot welcome a statistically significant change on one level and then say that the other statistically significant change the CSO mentioned is being addressed.  The CSO outlined that 17% of calls and dispatches were not recorded on the PULSE database, and that the 50% of detections by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is closer to 40%.  It is important to qualify any remarks about statistically significant change with what the CSO and the Garda Inspectorate has stated so that we do address the serious matter of statistics.  We cannot welcome change on one level because it is a positive news story for the Minister and her Department while on another level say the CSO statistics are being addressed.  We do not know that until a number of years pass, and anyone who does basic statistics would tell the Minister that.  We need to qualify any remarks about statistical changes.  I have heard many anecdotal stories from people who have been burgled.  They called the garda&iacute; but did not have anyone call to their house.  I doubt those crimes are being recorded.  When they contact the garda&iacute;, they are often asked if the burglar is still in the house and if they are not, nothing happens.  There is no follow up.  Who is to say that is not in the incorporation of statistics?  Serious work needs to be done on that.  We need to be careful with the way we massage and talk about crime statistics because what we heard from Government and the previous Minister in the past five years was that crime levels were dropping, that there were no issues with recruitment, and that we had a sufficient number of garda&iacute;.  We then saw a massive statistical change, which intensified recruitment.  It is important that we qualify any remarks about statistics with what is reflected in the Garda Inspectorate report and by the CSO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#D02200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Some of my questions interlink with the issues to which Deputy Chambers has alluded.  In terms of the figures, I would make the point that the CSO made it clear that it welcomed the significant improvement.  It behoves us, as committee members, to be accurate in our comments rather than using terminology which does not reflect what the CSO stated.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  In terms of Garda recruitment, I welcome the figure of 5,000 applications.  That so many people in our society are willing to become involved in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is at the core of protecting our communities and our country, is very welcome.  In that regard, the additional numbers coming through the recruitment process this year are welcome but I refer to the deployment of those recruited throughout the country, between urban and rural areas.  How will that address the Minister's comments about tackling urban crime, which is the subject of a great deal of reporting, but also rural crime as well?<\/p> <p>  I want to raise another issue, which has not been raised by previous speakers.  In light of the comments made by the British Prime Minister on Brexit, which are contrary to what we in this country will no doubt work for tirelessly and what we would like to see, which would be some form of soft exit without the imposition of a Border, there must be substantial implications from that, not least in terms of a planning process but also budgetary implications in terms of policing between the North and the South.  As we know, a large number of criminal groups have tried to wreck our economy for decades in their funding efforts for various others.  If we are to go towards a hard Border, which none of us wants, what provisions can be put in place to address that?  Otherwise, that will once again be a major financial drain on the resources of both the Minister's Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I may contribute again after the Minister has answered those two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#D02300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>The first question from Deputy Chambers was on the role of the Policing Authority and its work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is a new Vote in 2016.  The Policing Authority is newly established.  It is an independent agency under the aegis of my Department.  It was established on 1 January this year, following the enactment of the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Authority Act 2015, which amended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act of 2005.<\/p><p>The Estimates provide funding for the Policing Authority to implement a programme of independent oversight of the policing functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The board has outlined its priority areas and the outputs it wants to see this year.  It wants to establish the authority, get it up and running, and hold public and private meetings.  It wants to hold four meetings in public with the Garda Commissioner and make all the practical arrangements for the establishment of a new authority and so on.  The point Deputy Jack Chambers raised is about the actual way it does its work.  This is an independent agency, with a highly qualified board.  There has not been one question from anybody about the calibre of the people who were selected through the PAS system for the board.  The chair, Ms Josephine Feehily, is highly respected and the board has got on with its work.<\/p><p> The agency has had various meetings with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other parties, including the Garda Inspectorate, to gain an understanding of the structure, the resources of the organisation, and the impact of the reform plan.  It uses various methods, such as workshops and meetings.  It is entirely appropriate that the Policing Authority decides how it does its work.  At the end of the day what one wants to see is a strong relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority, but an appropriate relationship where people are held to account and there are public meetings.  I certainly do not intend to interfere.  It would be completely inappropriate for me to direct the Policing Authority on how to do its work and how to develop relationships and the different methods it uses.  I have confidence that the way it will do its work will be appropriate and within its remit.  That is very clearly understood by both the chair and members of the authority.  Obviously, the joint committee has an opportunity to invite the Policing Authority to appear before it to explore these issues, and the committee has done so.<\/p><p> Obviously nobody wants to see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na taking strike action.  That is the first very clear statement I want to make in respect of the current situation.  I will do everything possible, and the Government's negotiating team will do everything possible, to ensure there is progress on the current issues.  To recap, following negotiations, the AGSI accepted the proposals by a 70:30 majority and signed an agreement just two or three weeks ago.  Since then, its representatives have raised concerns about a number of issues and I met them yesterday.  I listened to their concerns and I have undertaken to have further discussions.  My officials will be in contact with them to work on the areas of concern, one of which is in respect of the Public Service Pay Commission and how it will do its work.<\/p><p> In regard to the GRA, we reached a draft agreement last Friday week, which we hoped would be accepted by the broader executive.  As it turned out, it was not accepted and they have taken the action, with which members are familiar.  The draft agreement involved the lifting of the increment freeze and restoration of the rent allowance for new entrants, which is worth &euro;4,150 per annum.  The proposed agreement provided for it to be restored in two phases, 50% with effect from 1 January 2017 and the remaining 50% with effect from 1 January 2018.  This would have led to an immediate improvement in conditions.  Obviously, the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest will also have an impact on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the next number of years.  There was a commitment of flexibility in respect of additional hours and for the Commissioner to have the flexibility to work out a way that would be best suited to the organisation's needs and those of members in consultation with the GRA.  There was also a provision about extra hours and a commitment to move to a 39-hour week.  There were a number of other points, for example, the period of six months of on-the-job training completed by members recruited between 1989 and 2013 being recognised for the calculation of pension entitlements, subject to the payment of the contribution, and promotion opportunities to increase as Garda recruitment increases and so on.  The draft agreement has been rejected.  To respond to Deputy Jack Chambers, I would like to see a continued focus on negotiation with the GRA.  I made the point that we want to deal with the issues the AGSI has now raised, which is different from what was on the table a couple of weeks ago when its members were balloted. <\/p><p> There are parameters in respect of public sector pay.  A total of 285,000 public sector workers have accepted the approach by Government, with 21 unions having signed agreements, and we have a clear programme in terms of restoration of pay.  Having said that, I believe we can find a way forward in the very near future in relation to garda&iacute; having their own industrial relations mechanisms for dispute resolution.  Mr. Horgan is examining the review of the IR mechanisms and other issues and I have given a commitment the review will be completed by the end of this year.  We need to tease out the connections between that review and the Public Service Pay Commission.  I have undertaken to look at that and we will continue to discuss the various issues with the GRA.  I am meeting the GRA on Thursday.  Clearly, I am not negotiating myself - there will be a negotiating team in place - but I am having these early meetings to try to ensure we can find a pathway forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#D02400","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Will the T&aacute;naiste respond to the other members please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#E00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Deputy Brophy asked about the deployment of those who were being recruited.  Let me stress that deployment is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I do not interfere in any way whatsoever in the deployment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That may have happened many years ago but it certainly did not happen under the previous Government and it will not happen under this Government.  Deployment is an operational issue for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  The Garda Inspectorate focused in its assessment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the point that deployment is linked to levels of crime in different areas, and that it has to be appropriate deployment.  In relation to those who were recruited in the past number of years, garda&iacute; have been deployed all over the country in both urban and rural areas.  It is the Commissioner's job to assess the precise location for the new recruits.  I believe it has been done in a fair and objective manner, and the important point is to accelerate recruitment.  We know that the economic situation impacted seriously on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There has been no recruitment since 2008 and Templemore was closed.  There was no investment in vehicles.  Members have heard stories about the lack of vehicles, but there has been significant investment of tens of millions in new vehicles that are better suited to the demands of modern policing.  The vehicles are more appropriate to deal with the criminal gangs and their resources.  Garda deployment is very much an operational matter.  If we recruit more garda&iacute;, we can deal with the impact the economic recession had on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by making sure there are more members to be allocated.<\/p> <p>  Brexit will have many implications for the Department of Justice and Equality.  I met the Minister at the Department of Justice, Ms Claire Sugden, at the North-South Crime Conference in Enniskillen last week.  This is a very welcome initiative that takes place between North and South with the highest levels of management of the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na meeting and discussing cross-Border work.  The relationship has never been better between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>It is a very good basis on which to go into discussions in the justice area regarding Brexit.  At ministerial level, the relationship has never been better.  This means we are starting from a very good base in discussing the very serious justice issues that arise.  At the meeting, I was told that the officials in Northern Ireland have been analysing the impact of Brexit and carrying out a risk assessment.  There are 18 items of legislation in the family law area, 11 of which impact Northern Ireland, regarding which they are examining the domestic, international and EU legislation and analysing what will change in the context of Brexit.  This is just one area.<\/p><p> We recently had some very serious issues regarding illegal immigration and sham marriages, and there has been cross-Border co-operation on them.  We will continue to work on immigration issues together.  There is a new task force arising from the Fresh Start agreement and it has focused on cross-Border work on child pornography.  The task force has done very detailed operations on rural crime North and South which have had good impact.  A number of people are being prosecuted.  Both groups are working on a range of other areas.  Issues relating to the common travel area are key to the justice sphere, and working through the implications of Brexit.  We have started this work and have held ministerial meetings and meetings between officials.  Our Secretaries General are in London today meeting the Home Office officials and also their counterparts from all UK Government Departments.  There is a huge amount of focus on the issue.  The very important point is that we do not want anything to interfere with the peace process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#E00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>We are talking about performance measures and whether money is being well spent.  We cannot measure anything when the data are flawed.  It is not good enough to say that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, says things are improving and that is grand.  Against the backdrop of the criticisms, reports and the thousand recommendations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate about improvements that had to be implemented, we still have a scenario in which there are major discrepancies in the reporting of crime, which means we cannot measure anything.  Items are not being put on the PULSE system and activities are being consciously downgraded to understate crime levels.  We must return to it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate has commented on the situation.  GSOC and the Policing Authority have said they are not adequately equipped legally to do the job the public expects them to do, namely, to be the body of oversight and to deal with complaints.  We are putting money into these valid Garda oversight organisations, but they are saying they do not have the legislation to do the job for which they are receiving the money.  Where is the legislation to support their work?  Otherwise, what is the point?  Are we just putting money into a cosmetic exercise of accountability unless we beef up the layer of independence?<\/p> <p>  The fact that Vote 21 on prisons has not been mentioned anywhere is indicative of the fact that it is the poor relation.  People are forgotten when they are sent to prison and we do not spend enough time examining and addressing the vast amount of money we spend on imprisoning people and whether it is successful.  In the report and in the mid-year position, the Minister said Vote 21 should be dealing with providing a \"safe, secure, humane and rehabilitative custody for people who are sent to prison\".  The fact that the educational programmes in prisons are appalling and access to drug rehabilitation is, in many instances, non-existent, makes a mockery of the statement.  I wonder what measurements are being put in place in technology, particularly regarding P19s, which are complaints by prisoners regarding the prison process.  There is no system for computerising them.  Legal representatives of prisoners are submitting freedom of information, FOI, requests to try to get information about the complaints their clients have submitted, and the Department and the Prison Service are saying they cannot provide the information given that it is not computerised.  At the same time, when a prisoner goes to court, a list can be provided of all their alleged wrongdoings.  What level of investment is going into technology regarding P19s?<\/p> <p>  Prisons are expensive.  What is the point in putting somebody in prison if he or she is going to come out and be exactly the same.  Deputy Mick Wallace and I had a horrific experience on Friday when we visited Portlaoise Prison and saw the treatment of a clearly troubled young man.  It was worse than anything I have ever seen and constitutes a violation of human rights.  Five prison officers in riot gear spend all day, every day accompanying the young man as soon as his door is opened, wherever he needs to go.  This is a complete and utter breach of medical reports about how he should be treated.  It is ridiculous.  I imagine five prison officers could be doing something much more constructive.  All the young lads told us he would like to develop his education and reintegrate into the prison population.  Unless we address it, we will send seriously damaged people back out into society.<\/p> <p>  Since the departure of Brian Purcell, has a new Secretary General been appointed to the Department?  Does the Department not need a Secretary General?  Is it a saving that one has not been appointed and can the money be spent somewhere else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#F00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I will follow up on Deputy Clare Daly's final point, which I was going to raise, namely, the Prison Service Vote.  We do not measure the outputs.  We have very broad statements from the Department, for example, \"ensure that drug addiction treatment programmes are available for all prisoners ... willing to participate\".  We all know there are not enough drug treatment programmes in prisons for those who wish to participate.  Such broad statements give us no tangible evidence that they are working.  We do not follow up with prisoners when they are released and we do not know how successful these programmes are.  Even the Department says there is no dataset in place which provides the necessary information to measure all prisoner reintegration.  The recidivism studies published in conjunction with the CSO can be used as a key indicator for reoffending rates.  We do not have the outputs and inputs and the data to be able to measure it.  While we have broad statements such as a certain number of people engaged in juvenile diversion programmes, we have no data to show the number of people who did not go on to commit crime or who went into education.  We need to examine this issue of broad statements.<\/p> <p>  In 2012 there was a major issue with family law courts and long waiting times.  The Department implemented an initiative called the family mediation initiative.  We also considered a business and commercial mediation pilot scheme, which was to resolve commercial disputes.  The Department is saying it is too early to measure how successful they are.  When will we get some feedback on these two initiatives to see how successful they are and whether we are saving money as a result of them?<\/p> <p>  I will welcome the construction of the new prison in Cork.  The facility caters for up to 310 prisoners and more than 250 no longer have to slop out.  However, there is a major issue in the local community around the old prison and the future plans for it.  I am not up on the Estimates.  I presume there is an ongoing cost to having it there, even though it has been closed.<\/p> <p>  Although we keep hearing we will get a certain number of extra garda&iacute; coming through Templemore and via recruitment, we do not get net figures, and it is the net figures off which we need to work.<\/p><p>Yes, we will have 800 new recruits in 2017 but we also need to see what is the net figure when retirements are taken into account.  When we speak about Garda numbers, we should be talking about Garda hours and how the numbers of Garda are being used, how many are on traffic duty, how many are on burglary duty and how many are on drug detection.  That would give a more accurate indication of how effective the numbers are and whether we are getting value for money.  That may be an operational issue but I am sure it is information that can be provided.<\/p><p> My final question goes back to the CSO report, and yes there are two conflicting reports and it is important that we do not just cherry-pick from one report as opposed to another report.  The Minister said in her opening statement that she has spoken to the CSO with regard to the report.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate if she has spoken to the Commissioner about the reports.  The Minister made a bizarre statement this morning when she said that all crimes have been investigated, even if they have not been recorded.  I do not know how we can qualify that statement.  How do we know crimes have been investigated if they have not even been recorded?  Again, as Deputy Jack Chambers said, we cannot just make statements - we must be able to support them.  To state that all crimes are investigated even if they are not recorded is a very broad statement.  We still have not received a reason 16% of crimes have not been recorded on PULSE.  We do not know why crimes are being reclassified.  There may be very legitimate reasons but we have not got that information.  As well as speaking to the CSO, has the Minister also spoken to the Garda Commissioner?  If she has, maybe she would give the committee some feedback on that conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#F00300","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Minister, could you answer the issues raised by Deputies Daly and O'Brien?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#G00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Yes.  The first issue that Deputy Daly raised was in regard to the statistics, and a number of Deputies continued to raise that.  I will summarise the important issues that were noted in the CSO report this year.  Compared with the CSO report that was published last year, the amount of non-recording of crime onto PULSE fell very slightly.  The previous issue of the degree of misclassification of criminal incidents to non-crime categories fell significantly.  The number of crimes incorrectly marked as detected fell significantly.  I want to put on the record that some of the key findings of the CSO report can be summarised as follows: an estimated 17% of crime reported, which does not appear to be captured on PULSE, reduced from 20% in the first CSO report on quality.  These are quality reports that monitor the changes in an ongoing way.  An estimated 2% of crime incidents were incorrectly classified, a reduction from 5%.  It is now 2% and we want to work on that 2%.  Some 3% of incidents were classified as attention and complaints - a non-crime category - which should have been classified as a crime.  That is reduced from 7%.  That is an improvement from 7% of those incidents being wrongly categorised down to 3%.  Some 1% were classified as property lost, a reduction from 4%.  Some 2% were classified as domestic disputes, a reduction from 7%.  That is also very significant.  One can see in each of those areas, the monitoring, discussion and reform in statistics by the CSO's objective monitoring, that improvements are being made.  The CSO's review of detections suggested that 10% of the detections sampled should not have been recorded as detections.  That was reduced from 16%.  We are getting more accuracy in the recording of crime.  This is an international issue and one that we must continue to work on.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien referred to all crimes being investigated.  Of course, I cannot say that every crime that is reported has been investigated, but I repeat what the Commissioner said that the fact it had not been recorded properly did not mean the crime had not been investigated.  This issue with regard to crime statistics is clearly ongoing, and I have no doubt that the committee will be discussing it next year when we have a new CSO report.  As we put more investment into IT and as PULSE records ongoing investigations, which it is now doing, as opposed to just the recording of crime, a difference will be made.<\/p> <p>  Members raised the issue of prisons.  I was in Portlaoise Prison last week looking at the conditions in the old building and getting an update on the work planned there and the improvements that can be made in the meantime.  There is a big refurbishment programme which I believe is to start next year and perhaps the old building will be gone completely in a few years as there is a plan to replace it.  The capital has been earmarked for that project.  As Deputy O'Brien will know from the Cork situation,<\/p> <p>there have been huge improvements made in prison buildings in the State - for example, in slopping out.  There is a very small amount of work still to be done in that regard.  Over the lifetime of the next Irish Prison Service strategy, there are plans for a new cell block and a new female prison unit in Limerick and plans for the construction of a new maximum security unit in Portlaoise Prison to replace the existing one.  Members will be aware that the E blocks in Portlaoise Prison are very outdated and they will be progressed.  Taken in tandem, these two developments will result in the final elimination of the practice of slopping out across the entirety of the Irish prison estate.  Figures for July 2016 in the census show that only 55 persons were slopping out in the prison estate, a reduction from 1,003 in 2010.  That practice is about to be finished completely.  There have been huge improvements in regard to the prison build and Cork Prison is an example of best practice when it comes to conditions.  I was at the opening of that prison and saw the standard of that new building, of which Deputy O'Brien is clearly aware, and the facilities for prisoners, for the staff and for families who come to visit.  The staff has had to endure extremely difficult conditions in our prisons.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the other points raised by members about the quality of drug treatment and how prisoners are actually dealt with, this is an ongoing issue.  I met the international committee on the issues of health care, mental health and drug treatment in our prisons.  Clearly, there is scope and a need for improvement in that area.  The fact that we now have an independent inspector for prisons and that we get individual reports from him on incidents in the prisons is very important   We are examining this and have had a consultation on a broader inspectorate that could be established.  I will also meet with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in the near future to discuss more engagement between the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health on improving the medical care, the psychiatric care and mental health facilities in our prisons.  I believe this issue needs further investment.  We need to address it.  Drug treatment services are now in place in all closed prisons.  The policy of the Irish Prison Service, where a person who is committed to prison gives a history of drug use and tests positively, is to offer them detoxification if clinically indicated.  There is a full assessment.  There is quite a significant number of prisoners now and information from the Irish Prison Service would suggest that there is currently a significant number of prisoners currently self-detoxifying from methadone, resulting in a marked reduction in the average dose of methadone.  The drug treatment programme has nine places and it is provided in the medical unit of Mountjoy Prison.  There are other facilities available there also, such as slow detox and destabilisation relapse programmes.<\/p><p>The IPS is committed to reviewing and developing further treatment and rehabilitation services in the prison.  Deputies Jonathan O'Brien and Clare Daly raised the treatment of prisoners and working with them longer term.  One of the key initiatives currently involves a much closer relationship between the Probation Service, garda&iacute; and the Prison Service.  I launched a joint action programme for those three bodies last week in Portlaoise.  The programme focuses on persistent offenders.  The programme has already been implemented in Dublin with 90 offenders and has now been extended to Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick.  It is the kind of programme we need to see if we are to work effectively with prisoners.  It is not just about working with people during the period that they are in prison.  It is about having the proper links with the Probation Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they leave prison and for persistent offenders when they are in the community.  That is very much the direction those three bodies are moving in to engage in inter-agency work of a type which we have not, surprisingly, had before.  I was speaking to young garda&iacute; from Limerick who were at the launch.  They welcomed strongly the close collaboration with the Probation Service around particular individuals to give them better support and increase the chances of them avoiding becoming recidivist and of rehabilitating them.  That is very much the focus in terms of prisoners.<\/p><p> Deputy Daly talked about a particular case.  I cannot comment on individual cases here but I will certainly take up the points she raised about the young man she met.  It is, however, an operational matter to decide what number of prison officers are assigned to look after that young man during his stay in prison.  It will not have been a decision that was taken lightly.  I do not know the individual details, but I do not think for a moment that prison officers will lightly have taken a decision to have that level of supervision if there was no need for it.  However, the Deputy can provide me with the details.  I cannot act as judge and jury on it, no more than I can on other issues.  I have to ensure that fair procedures are in place.<\/p><p> There is a Secretary General in place in the Department but it is an acting position.  Clearly, all of the functions of Secretary General are being carried out by the person in the position.  The post was advertised across the Civil Service over the summer.  All serving civil servants are eligible to compete.  I expect to make an announcement on that shortly.  I think I have covered some of the issues Deputy Jonathan O'Brien raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#G00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I mentioned the family law mediation initiative which was put in place last year to address the long waiting times in family law cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#H00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>It is a priority for me to bring forward the family mediation legislation.

Following the visit of GSOC not too long ago, the first one is the suggestion and follow-up correspondence from GSOC on the need to review legislation in its area.  We have been requested to make suggestions and, or, work with GSOC to achieve that.  Does the Minister agree that it would be worthwhile to have a specific meeting or series of meetings with GSOC on the legislative review and, indeed, with the Policing Authority also?  The Minister, I know, agreed when the legislation was enacted to have a review period associated with it.  Her comments on that matter would be appreciated.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to hear that garda recruitment has gone so well in terms of the numbers who have applied.  Clearly, the overtures by the Department and garda&iacute; on entry level pay and other conditions were welcome.  Can the Minister outline the estimated cost of the agreement reached with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, notwithstanding its current status, in terms of the restoration of pay over a two-year period?  Is it covered under this Vote or will it be?  Does the Minister have the figures associated with the overall pay structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Haddington Road over the next number of years?<\/p> <p>  In line with a matter raised by Deputy Daly, the treatment of prisoners, I refer to an area she touched on, educational programmes.  Does the Vote we are discussing cover educational programmes within the Prison Service and would the Minister agree that the rehabilitative knock-on effects of having a solid, robust and worthwhile education programme within the Prison Service would be of great help?  I know there are programmes there and am referring, of course, to additional investment and whether that is a policy objective of the Department and of the Minister during her term of office?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers raised an issue in relation to deployment and I accept entirely the Minister's response that it is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, most Deputies across the State and our Seanad colleagues accept that there was a significant reduction in the number of garda&iacute; when Templemore was closed in terms of resources not being replaced within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As such, there is a relevant issue as to whether there is a policy within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Department to address the officers who left various divisions; not necessarily individual stations, because that would be micromanagement, but certainly from a divisional perspective.<\/p> <p>  We have a fundamental difficulty with statistics as has rightly been highlighted.  Statistics are a product of the manner in which they are recorded and therefore there have been problems, most likely for decades, in the way they have been presented.  It is difficult, notwithstanding the point that was made very well by Deputy Chambers.  We have a problem with the collation of statistics and the manner in which they are presented even with the significant improvements the Minister has highlighted.  Therefore, it is not right simply to say that because crime figures are down significantly, the crimes are not being recorded.  That is often thrown back.  In fact, they have not been recorded properly for decades.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has systematically increased budgets as did her predecessor over the years.  Notwithstanding the funding that has already been allocated through the IT systems of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I would like to see the eventual replacement of PULSE.  What is the potential cost to the Exchequer?  PULSE is obviously extraordinarily antiquated software.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has decried its deficiencies publicly and privately.  It even lacks the capacity to add certain fields for recording purposes.<\/p><p>Does the T&aacute;naiste have a contingency plan?<\/p><p> We are speaking about Brexit a great deal at present, and rightly so, in terms of planning.  A major question I have for the T&aacute;naiste on the deployment of officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is whether the Department has a contingency for a hard Border on the island of Ireland.  What plans does the Department have to tease out any response that might need to be made over the two years after the clock starts ticking in March?<\/p><p> With regard to allowances for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a matter I have raised on a number of occasions with the current and former Commissioners and the current and former Ministers is the importance of continuing professional development in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and providing an allowance for members in order that they can avail of training to upskill themselves and present a better service to citizens throughout the State.  I firmly believe An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a service and not a force and that it provides a service to citizens, notwithstanding its important role in dealing with crime and criminality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#H00600","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions on immigration, asylum and family law and I will try to keep them as brief as possible.

The minimum contribution for legal aid was increased from &euro;50 to &euro;130 by the former Minister, Alan Shatter, a number of years ago.  People who qualify for legal aid are on social welfare payments, and the difference between &euro;50 and &euro;130 is phenomenal for many people.  This increase deters individuals from getting legal advice.

Of course I take note of what the new chairperson of GSOC had to say when she appeared before the committee.  I will meet her, and the Department is in contact with GSOC.  She has been in position for approximately a year.  She is a very effective and competent chair doing a very good job.  As the committee will see from the annual GSOC report for 2015, which has just been released, the Garda Commissioner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na came back to GSOC within approximately 22 days with the details of 93.5% of complaints raised with GSOC.  They are allowed 30 days but on average they come back in 22 days.  There is very high compliance.  With regard to a number of individual cases, the chairperson indicated she would feel extra powers were necessary or would be helpful for GSOC, but the vast majority, more than 90%, of details sought from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were given immediately and within the timeframe outlined in the legislation.  We have to welcome this.<\/p> <p>  It will never be an easy relationship, and it should not be, between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because it is in a supervisory role and is the ombudsman for complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We made very significant changes to the powers of GSOC over the past two years, including making it a body for receiving protected disclosures and giving it the power to investigate complaints against the Garda Commissioner.  These are significant powers.  The establishment of the Policing Authority brought a new dimension to oversight of policing in the State.  We have been continually asked to move policing away from any sort of political involvement.  We set up these new bodies, the Policing Authority and GSOC, and these independent bodies are charged with very important work regarding policing.  My view is we need to support them to be as effective as possible.<\/p> <p>  GSOC received an increase of &euro;500,000 in 2016 and the Estimates are being kept under review.  It has had some difficulties in recruiting people and the recruitment has been somewhat slower than it could anticipate.  I do not believe it spent all of the money we have given it for recruitment.  We are committed to increasing its staff, supporting recruitment and supporting it financially.  If there are particular issues with which it feels it needs financial support, we are committed to doing this.  If legislative change is required, and I will meet Ms Justice Ring to discuss the points she made to the committee, I will examine any changes that are necessary.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Policing Authority, I restate my view that it is one of the most important changes that has been made in the history of policing in this country.  It is fulfilling a very important role in terms of public confidence in policing.  It is very important, and we do not say it often enough, that public confidence is maintained in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because so much of its work is about confidence and the community having the confidence to report crimes and the confidence they will be investigated properly.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the cost of the elements of the pay agreement, the rent allowance applies to a particular cohort and the cost is approximately &euro;4 million.  The unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, is in the Estimates which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has provided for.  It is allowed for in the budget Estimates being discussed by the Government.<\/p> <p>  A point was made on developing educational programmes in the Prison Service, and this is very important.  We continue to fund and support these educational programmes.<\/p> <p>  A detailed question was asked about PULSE and whether it ought to be replaced.  What is happening at present is that new technologies are being introduced.  Three new initiatives were funded and introduced last year.  We have other funding and we must go to tender and have the tenders worked through, but effectively there will be new platforms so, as time goes on and we get greater investment, we will see that PULSE is almost being replaced because new technologies and new platforms are upgrading it all the time and making it more effective.  It will not be in one big fell swoop where we decide to put in a totally new technology different from PULSE.  What we are doing is building on what is there and bringing in new platforms.<\/p> <p>  A question was also asked about training, and the reform programme has a huge emphasis on training.<\/p> <p>  Senator Clifford-Lee asked about the Legal Aid Board.  There is no intention to reduce the contribution.  In fact, what I have said is where people are shown to have means, we will look for further contributions.  Many people who are eligible for legal aid do not have the means, and this is why they get the supports they do.<\/p><p>Equally, quite a lot of Deputies have raised with me a concern about people getting legal aid.  If they are shown to have resources and supports then they should make a contribution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#J01100","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I specifically referred to the family legal aid system.

Precisely what that means and how it will work clearly needs to be further analysed and various solutions will need to be considered.  For example, when I met Minister Davis with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, we had a conversation about an increased use of technology.  Yesterday, Mrs. Arlene Foster made the same point about developing technology to assist trade and borders.  It is one area for discussion.  Right now we are examining that issue rather than focusing on a hard Border following Brexit.  It is clear that nobody wants a hard Border.  Everyone has given the commitment but officials are currently engaging in a discussion about the actual detail.  The Cabinet committee on Brexit and the Taoiseach briefed all party leaders yesterday.  We are focusing on the implications of Ireland being a border for the EU and how we will interact in the context of the various issues that arise whether it is services, people or the common travel area.  It is about further discussion on what precisely that will look like.  Of course that will be subject to very detailed negotiations both with the UK - north, south, east and west - but also with other EU members because they will have a view on the matter.  One may well find that many other countries will talk about having a special relationship with bordering countries or the UK.  There are more than 1 million Polish citizens living in the UK so Ireland will have to make its case very carefully.  We do not want anything to happen that would interfere with the peace process and keep it in mind.  We have work to do with other member states. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#K01100","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Farrell happy with the response to his last question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#K01200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#K01300","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to say that we are well beyond our time and I ask the last two speakers to be as succinct as they possibly can.

Regardless of whether we have a hard or soft Border, many of us do not want a Border at all.  Certainly, the people of the North voted to remain and it should form the central component in all of our considerations here whether that is negotiating north, south, east and west or with EU colleagues. <\/p> <p>  I did not quite catch what the T&aacute;naiste said about officials carrying out impact assessments.  Did she mean the Department of Justice in the North, the Department of Justice and Equality in the South or both Departments, which would be good?  All of the positive cross-Border policing initiatives that she outlined are in jeopardy because of the uncertainty and unknown nature of what is ahead of us.  A hard or soft Border would not be particularly advantageous in terms of the well-being of the people across the island.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the following issue featured in the Minister's engagements thus far, and I hope it will, as the Taoiseach's national dialogue progresses and her own engagements progress.  There are many thousands of Irish citizens whom I presume have the right, under the Good Friday Agreement, to remain Irish citizens post-Brexit and thus EU citizens.  Will they be afforded the same rights and entitlements enjoyed by EU citizens even though they live in the North?  It is of deep concern to many of us that the British Prime Minister has campaigned strenuously against the Human Rights Act, for example.  The Irish Government and successful Governments have refused to introduce a human rights Act for the North despite it being a commitment given in various agreements. <\/p> <p>  Just as Irish citizens live in the North there are other EU nationals who live in the North or may travel to the North to work in Dungannon, Strabane or Newry.  When considering issues under the common travel arrangements we also need to think of the new Irish and migrant workers who live in the South but work in the North.  They may be adversely impacted as a result of England's decision to leave the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#K01500","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Sheanad&oacute;ir.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#K01600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste has covered a lot of the questions that I wanted to ask but I will highlight a couple of issues.<\/p> <p>  There is a lack of services provided to help people recover from addictions and mental health issues in the Prison Service.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has spoken a lot about the matter.  I have worked closely with many of the women in the D&oacute;chas prison so have seen the issues that arise for them and the lack of services.  It is shocking to see those women go through certain experiences, particularly those who want to step into recovery but do not know how to do so.  I hope that the Minister will make the provision of services a priority.  <\/p> <p>  I want to highlight staffing issues in the Prison Service.  They work at the coalface.  It can be soul destroying for them to work around people with addiction and they are firefighting.  I have seen how hard prison staff try to cope but a lot of them struggle with issues themselves around trying to deal with the impact of what they are trying to cope with.  They need greater understanding and more funding should be provided in that area.<\/p><p> Deputy Jack Chambers brought up the issue of community policing.  Again, I work with family members who have been impacted by having a loved one with an addiction problem.  Community policing is vital in this area, as they have really good understanding, empathy and compassion for the person who has a problem with addiction or mental health.  They can sit down and speak to the family and the person who may be heading into that area of addiction.  It is particularly important in rural communities.  It is time for people to have trust in the garda&iacute;, as they have lost that trust, particularly in the past few years.  It is time to build a relationship with communities, as that is vital.<\/p><p> I apologise because I must head off but I do have a particular interest in direct provision.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#K01700","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Before responding to the Senators, I would like to ask two additional questions that have not been specifically touched on, although it has been a very comprehensive engagement.  In her opening address, the Minister referred to Operation Thor and emphasised the example of the Government's response to crime in both rural and urban areas.  Looking at the areas indicated with respect to what the Minister is pressing for in the 2017 Estimates, she is talking about accelerating Garda recruitment and increased civilianisation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  With regard to additional capital expenditure, the only example she gives is the commencement of the new forensic science laboratory.  Is there anything in the proposal to address rural crime amounting to a proposal or intent for investment in or the reopening of any number of rural Garda stations that have been closed, the loss of which has had a very adverse impact on the addressing of rural crime?  It has also had, very clearly, a significant negative psychological impact on people living across rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Minister addressed other matters in the course of questioning from members and there was reference to the report in yesterday's media of the two recently presented protected disclosures from Garda officers.  A further protected disclosure, I understand, arrived on the Minister's desk last May and that has been sent to the Garda Commissioner to be addressed.  The garda involved has not had any correspondence or indication from the Commissioner as to what address is being given to it.  Is the Minister in a position to advise us if she had any response to that particular protected disclosure?<\/p> <p>  The Barrett report concerned the conduct of the investigation into Garda sergeant Maurice McCabe and how he highlighted issues.  It considered how he was treated as a serving member of the force.  The Minister has the Barrett report but is she giving any consideration to its publication?  It is a critical area of consideration by the members with regard to our pending report on oversight and accountability, of which the whistleblowers issue is a key area of address.  Would it be of help to members in the consideration of our position?  Has the Minister as such intent to share the content of that report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#L00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":376,"content":"<p>To answer Senator &Oacute; Donnhgaile, the impact assessment is being done in both Departments.  With regard to the analysis of the implications of Brexit, I was informed by officials from the Northern office at the North-South meeting I attended in Enniskillen that they were doing their own analysis, as we would expect.  All Departments are doing that here, as well as in the UK.  There are very different perspectives, of course, and implications.  I quoted the area of family law just to say the scale of the work that needs to be done in the North with the kind of changes that will be brought about.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of areas of particular concern to us, including the continuation of the European arrest warrant.  That is essential and we hope the UK will continue to engage in Europol, for example, and the broader areas I mentioned such as maintaining the Common Travel Area.  It is very important and links to the question about Irish citizens.  There are many Irish citizens in the UK and the North in particular.  They will maintain the rights associated with being an Irish passport holder but the environment is changing as a result of the UK decision to exit.  I certainly take that point.<\/p> <p>  I was in Belfast recently and I met somebody who told me about the number of people crossing the Border for work in his firm, which is a very big insurance company.  He outlined the connections between Derry and Donegal, for example, and the kind of movement that takes place on a daily basis in terms of getting to work without any Border implications.  All these issues must be considered in much detail in the context of Brexit because the process has been working so well and has been to the mutual advantage of North and South.  We want that to continue.  The Common Travel Area predates membership and those rights go back much further.  The Border and how it will be managed in the new context will be very much part of ongoing discussion.  It is always a priority for us.<\/p> <p>  I will take up a comment made by the Senator about various North-South operations being at risk.  I do not really accept that.  The level of engagement North and South, and the intention to engage both at a policing and security level, remains very high on the agenda.  It continues to be an absolute priority, whatever the changing context of Brexit.  That co-operation is at a certain level and the relationship building has got to a point where there are very strong North-South operations under the new task force established under the A Fresh Start agreement.  I see that continuing, and that is the commitment of both police forces.  This is in the context of Brexit but that level of co-operation for the security of the island as a whole and our people will need to continue and develop further, as opposed to going backwards anyway, even in the new position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#L00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I am glad and heartened to hear that.  However, with the greatest respect, it is not within the Minister's gift to make that commitment.  The difficulty, as mentioned by various Ministers and members of the Government at committees, is that a hard Border would present obvious infrastructural, political and social problems.  That includes issues of policing and justice.  Comments from the British Government indicate they are taking a certain trajectory with regard to a hard Border and there will be input from other EU member states.  I know I am preaching to the choir and do not need to say this to the Minister but this is happening at a much broader level.  I flagged this and our accessibility to the EU structures and rights afforded to us as Irish and EU citizens because they are all in jeopardy.  In negotiations that will take place at the various levels of government across the EU, there must be a steadfast and resolute position with regard to looking at Ireland in its entirety.<\/p> <p>  With the greatest respect, I mentioned rights and accessibility to EU rights and courts.  They are different but it is not quite the same for an Irish citizen living in Ballymurphy as an Irish citizen living in Birmingham.  I say that with the greatest respect for our emigrant community.<\/p><p>It impacts on the legacy issue.  The British Government currently refuses to engage in the legacy process using national security as a veto.

That has been stated at ministerial and policing levels in all my recent contacts with Ministers from both jurisdictions and the Chief constable and the Commissioner.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about Operation Thor, capital expenditure and station closures and commitments.  Last year, I reported to the committee on the large capital plan that is in place for the refurbishment and development of police stations throughout the country.  There is a huge number of projects.  He will be familiar with the need in Bailieborough, County Cavan.  There is upgrade work on the Garda College and in Limerick and a long list of PEMS stores that need to be put in place.  I will not go into detail but there is a significant capital allocation for new buildings and refurbishment for 2016 and 2017.  I can forward the details of the programme to the committee but that was announced by the former Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Harris, and myself last year.  There is a huge capital commitment for these projects, including a new regional headquarters in Sligo that is badly needed.  Three other headquarters are being developed in Wexford, Galway and Dublin and those projects are under way.<\/p> <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to asking the Policing Authority to examine Garda station boundaries, which is an issue.  As part of the review, I have said we will launch a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine positive impacts such openings would have impact on criminal activity with special emphasis on burglary, theft and public order.  I have asked the authority to put in place the necessary arrangements for the review.  That is ongoing and I do not have an update.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman raised issues relating to protected disclosures.  I would like to clarify that I did not get a report from the person he mentioned in HR because that person has no such role in sending a section 41 report to me.  That would be the Garda Commissioner and she forwarded those reports to me.  I am legally precluded from putting them in the public arena because of the details that are in them and the various considerations I have to have in respect of the issues I mentioned earlier in terms of protection of identity.  I have to be conscious of that.  As I said earlier, I have real difficulties commenting on individual cases, as the Chairman will appreciate.  Certain matters following the O'Higgins report have also been referred to GSOC for investigation.  That investigation is taking its course as well.  I want to be helpful to the committee in whatever way I can but I am not in a position to publish those two referrals to me now.  I am considering carefully the action I can take in respect of the protected disclosures currently on my desk.  My main consideration is that I want to ensure the rule of law applies in respect of the body of allegations within them and a fair and just procedure is put in place.  I cannot be judge and jury on them.  My job is to make sure that I follow the letter of the law; I will certainly do that.  There are a number of options regarding the management of the protected disclosures.  They have been just been received and I am carefully considering them.  I am doing a comprehensive assessment to decide the best route forward.  There are a number of routes open to me for consideration and I am carefully analysing what is the best possible route to deal with those protected disclosures.  I cannot talk here.  Other people may but I cannot talk about individual cases.  There is material in the public arena; I cannot address that.  What I can do as Minister is ensure a proper, fair procedure under which the rule of law is applied to any allegations that are put to me is in place.  That is what I have to oversee and I will ensure that they are dealt with appropriately and comprehensively in the right forum.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the point the Chairman made about other protected disclosures, I face the same constraints in respect of dealing with individual cases.  However, in terms of the analysis of any whistleblower complaint, it would not be appropriate at all for reports to come back to me and for me to be in correspondence with a whistleblower regarding the conduct of a case while that case is under way.  The protected disclosures legislation provides that whoever has been appointed to work on the case must do that and remain in touch with the whistleblower.  If issues arise, and there has been some public reporting of this, I will deal with them, but it is not appropriate for me to be back and forth in correspondence about what is precisely happening in a whistleblower case.  It is unacceptable if persons who report wrongdoing in any organisation, whether it is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other, are not treated property and to the highest standards.  I assure the Chairman that whistleblowers have to be treated properly and to the highest standards and it is incumbent on all organisations to have the proper policies and protections in place to ensure people are not further victimised if they report wrongdoing.  Any organisation under my remit has to have a policy and protections in place and has to make sure the policy is implemented.  That is what I want and my determination is to ensure that, whatever happened in the past, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should operate to the highest standards in this area.  This involves ensuring that allegations of wrongdoing are dealt with properly and that the persons making the allegations are fully protected and respected.  However, when allegations emerge, I will certainly not be judge and jury on them.  I will make sure the proper processes are put in place and the proper avenues are used to ensure whatever allegations are made are fully tested and fully investigated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#M00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I welcome that assurance.

Both summits have highlighted the need for international co-operation to address the growing refugee and migration crisis and I share the concern at the scale of this crisis.  A total of 65 million people are estimated to be displaced, 40% of whom are children.  As the committee is aware, the Government voluntarily agreed to join the EU response to this crisis and to accept 4,000 refugees under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  Progress was initially slow, and it has been slow across Europe because there were many logistical difficulties in registering the refugees, many of whom wanted to continue to Sweden and Germany and their relocation within Europe across every country.  Some of the commentary has suggested this is unique to Ireland, and it is not.  We are involved in a process within the EU.  We are playing our part and these issues have been resolved in respect of the registration of refugees and the hot points, particularly in Greece.  There are continuing problems in Italy because Italy is having problems with security vetting and does not want other countries involved in that.  We are working on that issue too.<\/p> <p>  Both summits highlighted the need for international co-operation to address the growing refugee and migration crisis.  The numbers are now increasing quickly, with 555 refugees having already come to Ireland.  More are coming over the next few weeks.  Each month, we anticipate a further intake.  The aim is that between 880 and 1,000 people will have arrived before the end of this year.<\/p> <p>  Preparations are under way to bring a further 260 persons from Lebanon early in 2017 under the resettlement programme.  My aim is to make a further pledge next spring to accept more refugees from those currently located in Lebanon.  While the EU element for relocation has been slow, we have moved ahead to meet our commitment under resettlement, that is, people coming from refugee camps.  We have to send officers out to meet the refugees to assess their various files and make arrangements.  We have done that and are ahead of schedule in respect of the resettlement.  That was in part to deal with the delay in relocation.  <\/p> <p>  These pledges are in addition to the number of people due to come to Ireland from Greece.  We have formally notified the Greek authorities that we wish to accept 1,000 relocated refugees by the end of September 2017.  That programme is subject to change and acceleration as well.  The success of our programme depends on international co-operation and on developing the international mechanisms that enable us to bring vulnerable people across Europe to a new home here in Ireland.  We have seen now at first hand how differing systems internationally and implementation problems externally can delay a national programme.  We have to operate within a system that has been agreed at EU level on responding to the crisis.  That is what we are doing.  We are not a front-line state - people do not arrive on our shores as they do in Greece and Italy - but we are working with the mechanisms there and want to develop and strengthen those mechanisms to tackle the refugee crisis. <\/p> <p>  Ireland co-facilitated the UN summit with Jordan, and there was much comment on the part our diplomats played in getting the refugee response framework together, which was agreed there.  It is very important to have that in place.  The framework sets out an extensive range of concrete actions which, once implemented, should bring about real improvements in the situation and the experience of refugees across the world.  It is addressed to host countries, transit countries and third parties and covers issues such as reception, the immediate and ongoing needs of refugees, the importance of support for host countries and the action needed to achieve durable solutions.  It commits countries to protect the human rights of all refugees and migrants, regardless of status.  This includes the rights of women and girls, promoting their full, equal and meaningful participation in finding solutions to refugee situations.  It aims to ensure that all refugee children are receiving education within a few months of arrival in their country of resettlement.  We are ahead of other countries when it comes to access to education for young people who arrive here.  They have immediate access to primary and secondary level education.  Another aim is to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence experienced by refugees and migrants.  This is a very serious issue and women in these situations are very vulnerable.  It commits to work towards ending the practice of detaining children for the purpose of determining their migration status.  Some countries do this; we do not, but that was part of the goal.  Another is to improve the delivery of humanitarian and development assistance to the countries most affected, including through innovative multilateral financial solutions, with the goal of closing all funding gaps.  Another goal is to find new homes for all refugees identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, as needing resettlement, that is, the group we have been responding to, and expand the opportunities for refugees to relocate to other countries through, for example, labour mobility or education schemes.  That is an area where Ireland could play a greater role.  <\/p> <p>  It is a menu for action by the international community.  It is a current crisis.  We need to see action now and it is intended as the foundation for a more global compact on migration.  This was the first time that migration had been discussed by the General Assembly, in the same way as refugees have been discussed there.  It is intended as the foundation for a global compact on migration, to be agreed in 2018, which seeks to develop a global response to the issue of migration more broadly.  It names the issue of migration, which is so prevalent today with the movement of 200 million.  We are well used to that issue in Ireland given our history of emigration and of migration into the country.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s practice on resettling refugees meets the obligations of the refugee response framework.  We enable refugees to access mainstream services such as health, education and social protection.  This is not said often enough, although there are problems.  Refugee children are enabled to attend school, for instance, from the time that they come to Ireland.  We also fund resettlement workers to support the integration of refugees into their new communities.  This is challenging for all front-line services but we have several hundred refugees who in the past few months have gone to live in various communities around the country and are receiving local services.  They have been housed.<\/p><p>I would say that the UN summit process and the refugee response framework have confirmed that tackling the refugee crisis must be an international priority.  This is an international priority for the years ahead.  As a result, I anticipate that the Irish refugee protection programme will have to run beyond 2017.  Ireland will be expected to continue to accept programme refugees in the years ahead.  In light of the level of movement we are seeing, it is clear this is an ongoing crisis.  Our ships are still rescuing people in the Mediterranean.  The leaders' summit is intended to secure international co-operation towards three principal aims, the first of which is to increase funding to humanitarian appeals and international organisations.  Ireland contributed &euro;65 million to Syria last year and has made a contribution to the World Food Programme over a three-year period.  We give a high level of international aid.  The second goal is to admit more refugees through resettlement or other legal pathways.  The third aim is to increase refugees&rsquo; self-reliance and inclusion through opportunities for education and legal work.  We have joined the legal statement that is being issued from the leaders' summit.\u00a0 That statement commits participating countries to do more on humanitarian assistance and on the resettlement of refugees.  It also commits participating countries to work together in support of the development of the global compact on responsibility sharing for refugees.<\/p><p> As I said at the summit, and I do not think anyone would disagree, we need a multifaceted international and global response because no single country can solve this issue.  This response involves working with countries of origin on conflict prevention.  I cannot let today pass without calling on everybody involved to take further action to resolve the appalling situation in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria.  Obviously, we need to deal with the core causes of this movement of people.  In many cases, we can do this by focusing on conflict prevention.  When I was at the summit, I pointed to the specific role that can be played by women and girls.  If they are facilitated to join peace processes, this can lead to good and durable solutions to conflicts.  I also reported on the establishment of the Irish refugee protection programme and referred to Ireland&rsquo;s strong record on overseas development aid.  Ireland committed &euro;647 million to development aid in 2015, approximately &euro;140 million of which was provided in the form of humanitarian assistance.  I have already mentioned the amount of money we are contributing to Syria and the role of the Naval Service in rescuing 12,400 people.  I think these summits are important as a signal of the international community&rsquo;s determination to do more to address the refugee crisis and as an important next step in the international response to this issue.  We certainly want to support those international efforts by providing humanitarian aid to specific areas and by vindicating our commitment within the EU to the refugee programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#N00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee and Deputies Alan Farrell and Clare Daly have indicated that they wish to speak.

I will keep them as brief as possible because I know many other members want to make contributions.<\/p><p>The McMahon report, which was published last year, made a number of recommendations with regard to the direct provision and protection systems.  The report was supposed to be fully implemented by July 2016.  While some of the recommendations have been implemented, the more meaty ones have not been.  I refer, for example, to the recommendation that individuals who have been in the asylum process for five years or more should be automatically granted leave to remain.  Having spoken to practitioners in this area, it seems there has been a soft implementation of this recommendation on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  Leave to remain is being granted to families, which is leaving many single men in a kind of limbo because they have not been granted leave to remain.  Could the T&aacute;naiste address that issue?  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, indicated in the Seanad in July that this recommendation would be implemented when the Oireachtas returned after the summer.<\/p><p>On a related issue, the bifurcated system for asylum and subsidiary protection was supposed to be integrated into a single system.  The Minister of State indicated that this was coming on stream fairly shortly.  Having spoken to people involved in the processing of this, it appears that no progress has been made in this regard.  I would appreciate it if the T&aacute;naiste could give me some answers.<\/p><p>Does the T&aacute;naiste intend to extend the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to children within the direct provision system?  If not, can she explain why not?<\/p><p>I would also like to ask about the business permission visa system, which was suspended on 16 March last.  The old version of the system allowed people to apply for residence if they were investing &euro;300,000 and creating and maintaining at least two Irish jobs.  What is happening in this regard?  When will the system be reintroduced?  A number of people in this country who are working on business proposals are in limbo.  As a result, we are losing out on potential jobs and investment in business in Ireland.<\/p><p>My attention has been drawn to the requirement for a chef to be paid a minimum salary of &euro;30,000 in order to be eligible for an employment permit.  While there is a chronic lack of chefs in Ireland, the salary level of &euro;30,000 at which this requirement has been set is far too high.  Exemptions have been made for workers in other areas, including IT professionals and individuals working in the meat industry.  I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste to reduce the lower salary level to allow chefs to be employed under the work permits system.<\/p><p>People who make applications to the EU treaty rights section currently have to wait approximately ten months.  This is in contravention of the directive, which states that applications should be processed within six months.  This is having a significant impact on many people in this country.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to address that issue.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste referred earlier to sham marriages.  There are a number of issues with regard to the manner in which applications have to be made when EU nationals want to get married to non-EU nationals.  There is now a special application process, including a personal interview with both parties.  People are being racially profiled under this system.  Some people have been refused permission to marry on the basis of statistics rather than individual assessment.  More importantly, people who are deemed to have failed the interview are not being informed of the reasons for that failure.  They are merely told they have 28 days to appeal the decision.  It is not possible for people to appeal these decisions unless they are given correct information on the specific areas of their interviews on which they were failed.  The timeframe I have mentioned does not allow people to get information from freedom of information requests.  This needs to be addressed urgently because it is creating big problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#O00300","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Farrell after the T&aacute;naiste has responded to Senator Clifford-Lee.

As the head of the Irish delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, I have the privilege of regularly meeting delegates of the 56 other members states involved.  The vast majority of them are in Europe and they are suffering exactly the same difficulties we are having with regard to the numbers of migrants that have been committed to through various agreements at an EU level versus the numbers applying.  As the Minister has identified, we are not unique.  The vast majority of migrants crossing from Syria and beyond are applying for visas to remain in Germany, Sweden and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to my counterpart in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is not a member state, on Saturday.  That country has approximately 200 migrants who are in limbo because of the agreements in the European Union.  These migrants have no desire to be in that country but, because of a variety of agreements, they are being left in limbo.  Regrettably, I only find out about this scenario after the Minister's attendance at the summit because it is a matter worthy of being raised and aired at such an event.<\/p> <p>  I have two short questions for the Minister, who was rather frank in the information she provided.  We have a determined target in terms of the number of migrants we will accept.  There is then the number of people who have applied or been processed.  From an EU perspective, does the Minister foresee a scenario where we will make a determination on certain groups approved by Irish and\/or fellow EU authorities in some form of arrangement which would allocate them into a specific country regardless - and this may be a bit of an issue - of their own desire?  If we have a problem, particularly on the cusp of Europe, and it is a problem that is getting worse, where individuals do not wish to come to these shores for a variety of what I am sure are valid reasons, from a humanitarian perspective, even temporary settlement or resettlement in this jurisdiction would give them relief and would relieve the pressures on our European counterparts.  I might add that this is not a matter the OSCE parliamentary members from across the globe have raised.  It is rather one that might be seen as a response to and a move away from issues such as the crises we have in Calais and elsewhere across Europe.<\/p><p> My final question relates to migrants having access to third level education.  It also applies to those wishing to become Irish citizens or remain in the State.  I appreciate it is not within the remit of the Department but I would welcome the Minister's view on the matter.  We give children and young people access to our education system.  This is an excellent endeavour on our part and I imagine it is echoed in other countries.  However, we deny these people access to third level education.  Having put them through the Irish education system, especially given the legacy of delays within direct provision and so on, this is bordering on cruel.  Many of these children have been brought up here and they are as Irish as my two children.  This is something we really should address.  I know there was a debate about the matter in the last D&aacute;il.  The question should be given another airing given the new environment in which we find ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#P01300","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The first issue raised by Deputy Farrell relates to the discussions taking place at EU level on asylum policy generally.  There are divided views on the question of a mandatory quota and it is difficult to see where agreement will emerge.  Effectively, under the relocation scheme a mandatory quota was not agreed but rather a quota for each country.  Clear criteria were set out on how that was to be decided.  They are published and take into account population, GDP and various other factors.  Under that arrangement we have a quota.  Of course it was optional for us; we were able to opt in.  The figure of 2,622 is our effective quota and that is what we are working towards.<\/p> <p>  The mandatory question is a matter of ongoing discussion.  Committee members will have seen the Hungarian response and other responses.  Other countries have strong views on the matter and will not support it.<\/p> <p>  There are choices for refugees at present in terms of country of destination.  If family are in place already there is choice, to a degree.  It is not 100% but this is taken into account when our teams go to Greece and the refugee camps there.  If people there proactively indicate that they want to come to Ireland, that is helpful and we try to respond to that.  As part of the assessment process if people already have members of the family in a given country, they get priority when it comes to going to that country.  It is not an absolute right.  Under international refugee practice, it is not seen as a definitive right for a person in that situation to choose the country in question.  Although, if any of us were in that situation, I imagine we would like to go to the country with which we might identify ourselves.  Choice is taken into account as much as possible.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Farrell asked about third level education.  If a person has leave to remain, he or she is eligible for third level.  A programme is in place for children in direct provision going to third level.  The former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, made a decision last year in respect of children who had been in direct provision and who were at that point ready to go to third level.  She decided they could do that without having to pay foreign fees.  Sponsorship programmes are in place.  However, this area requires a more long-term policy from the Department of Education and Skills and that Department is working on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#Q00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I found the introduction a little demoralising in some ways.  It summed up for me the point made by Deputy O'Brien earlier to the effect that we get nice statements and lofty aspirations but the reality on the ground is rather different.  We have heard a great deal from the Government about the thousands we are taking in, how the numbers are far beyond any commitments given and so on.  The reality is, as the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said last month, 486 people have been resettled in Ireland, 69 of whom came from Greece while none has come from Italy.  The figure includes one unaccompanied minor.  This is despite the Minister's public commitment that this would be a priority area.<\/p> <p>  I hate talking about numbers because we are talking about human beings, each of whom has to endure a horrendous journey to get to these outposts of Europe.  They bring the legacy of a life almost annihilated.  It is not even clear to me what the figures are.  For example, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said previously that of the 4,000 only 2,622 persons would be relocated from Italy and Greece, while the others would come on the family resettlement programme.  That is deeply troubling given the manner in which we are implementing that programme already.  For example, I am aware of a Syrian who lives here with Irish friends and who has been trying to relocate some of her family to Ireland under family reunification provisions.  Such has been the concern of some friends in Ireland that they have travelled to Greece to assist this woman to be reunited with her family.  They have been through extreme trauma.  Anyway, they have been unable to do what they set out to do.<\/p> <p>  The stories from the people on the front line do not back up the points made to the effect that it is a bureaucracy operated by the Greeks and Italians and it is all their fault.  Moreover, they do not correspond to Deputy Farrell's version to the effect that no one wants to come to Ireland anyway.  That is not what Irish volunteers are saying.  They have been in Greece and Lebanon.  To a man and to a woman the story they come back with is that no one there is aware of Ireland.  There is zero recognition of Ireland as a destination.  Irish volunteers have gone to every camp in Lebanon.  They have seen hardly any presence of Irish people there, albeit they are not there all the time.  They have interviewed people with the help of interpreters.  In the case of each of the sites, the people there simply did not know about Ireland, the type of country it was, whether they would be welcome or anything like that.  Deputy Wallace and I went to Calais.  Given the geography and given that Ireland is a small country, many people do not realise that Ireland is an English-speaking country.  However, language is one of the key reasons the people in Calais want to go to England.  They do not realise how the system works.<\/p> <p>  The approach taken to family unification has been adversarial rather than a sensitive or sympathetic approach.  I put it to the Minister that she has considerable latitude in this regard.  Ultimately, the decisions are taken by the Minister and she has discretion.  Why does she not intervene and exercise that discretion?<\/p> <p>  The Minister has made public statements to the effect that addressing the question of unaccompanied minors would be a priority.  This is a real area of concern, especially given the decision of the French Government to shut down \"the jungle\" later this month and the fact that France has said it cannot accommodate more than 250 of the unaccompanied minors there.  There is potential for hundreds of children to be lost and unaccounted for.  I want to know what we are doing in that regard.  What accommodation is available for these children?  We have tried to pursue this with Tusla and we have asked how the agency is dealing with these matters.  The Minister has spoken publicly of the extraordinary and generous offers by the public of accommodation and taking on children.  All of that is true but it is not being processed.  Where are the log-jams in that placement?  For example, Tusla has said it has vetted three people for foster care arrangements.  I and others have said publicly that we would be happy to put ourselves forward to care for an unaccompanied minor and to be vetted and so on.  If we were to publicly advertise these schemes I believe there are large numbers of Irish people who would be willing to participate and it could happen at no extra expense to the State.  It could alleviate the trauma those children are experiencing.  Why not establish a temporary consulate and humanitarian visa scheme?  We could bring some of those children here.  They are in imminent danger.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious of the time and I would like to discuss this more.  We have not done enough and there are things we could do if we had the will.  It would be great if we did something to stand out in terms of our dealings with the hot spots.  For example, there are 18 places for unaccompanied minors at the moment.  That is completely and utterly inadequate when it comes to the assessment of facilities here.  There should be at least 100 places.  Berlin, which has a population of 3.5 million people, has 900 residential places for unaccompanied children.  We need to do far more.  I am embarrassed and ashamed as an Irish person because of how little we have done.<\/p><p>I do not think it is bureaucracy or that people do not want to come to Ireland.

According to Greek figures and in terms of numbers taken for resettlement up to 28 September 2016, Lichtenstein is ahead of us, as are Norway, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland, Iceland and Malta.  However, we are not a front-line country with people arriving on our shores.  However, we are absolutely committed to taking the numbers I have outlined within the structures of the EU.  It has been a slow start and I regret that but it is outside my control or that of Government.  Nevertheless, the procedures are in place and staff teams from the Department of Justice and Equality are going out to refugee camps to identify people.  We are working with Greece to ensure that people know Ireland is an English-speaking destination.  The numbers are increasing now and will rise very significantly.<\/p> <p>  We have only dealt with several hundred to date but those people have come into our emergency reception centres, they have received English language training and have been put in contact with local services.  They have moved out to communities across Ireland and they are now beginning the integration process.  There is an absolute commitment to meet the targets we set.  I take the Deputy's point that the scale of this is appalling.  We must ask if there is more we can do and also what else we could be doing.  We are open to reconsidering the numbers next year but our first commitment is to take the numbers we said we would take within the EU scheme.  We have spoken to the Greek authorities about identifying young, unaccompanied minors.  Deputy Clare Daly has the numbers for Calais but we are not working in Calais.<\/p> <p>  We are, however, working with the Greeks to identify young unaccompanied minors.  Some significant issues arise in respect of unaccompanied minors.  The first one of these is identifying them and many of those who were initially identified as unaccompanied minors were actually 19, 20 or 21.  This is a problem that is recognised by all groups carrying out assessments in Greece.  I have spoken to the CEO of Tusla and that organisation has a commitment to take unaccompanied minors.  We are in the process of identifying them and we want to do the very best for them.  We believe the best thing would be to have foster homes for them but there is a shortage of foster carers in Ireland at the moment.  We must do everything we can to encourage more people to become foster parents.  I am advised that unaccompanied minors will begin to arrive shortly and will be placed in foster care.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said that nothing had been done in terms of a public response but that is incorrect.  I chaired a meeting on Monday at which the Red Cross was represented.  That organisation has worked with all the people who have offered pledges and it has identified people who are willing to supply housing.  Some very difficult issues arise in the context of pledges which come in from the public.  It is not the role of this committee to go into huge detail on them but the Red Cross has done very significant work in the past number of months with people who have given pledges, many of whom offered accommodation for three months or a year.  We need to consider the sustainable issues around that and where refugees go afterwards.  They will be citizens at that point, actually, but the question remains of where they go when their accommodation ceases to be available after a year or so.  Local authorities were also at the meeting on Monday and they are giving a very significant response, as evidenced by the numbers who have already gone through the emergency reception centres.  Insurance issues arise and there are health and safety issues.<\/p> <p>  The Red Cross has now got to the point where it can say there are a certain number of houses available for the refugees who are coming in.  A total of 640 have been supplied already and I think the figure for pledges from the public is approximately 160.  The Red Cross is working assiduously with the Department and other stakeholders to make sure that, as refugees arrive, they will be in a position to utilise those pledges.  The Deputy is wrong to say that the work is not being done.  The work is being done by the Red Cross.  There is a huge amount of detail in this work.  It is one thing for the public to respond to what they saw on the beaches of southern Greece but it is quite another thing to put in place a system whereby we can use the pledges we have received.<\/p> <p>  The churches are also involved in offering accommodation and that is also being worked through with the church representatives.  I held a meeting with them and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, is doing a huge amount of work in this area.  There has been a slow start, not to our resettlement programme but to our relocation programme.  People are now arriving every month, however, in increasing numbers.  This will test the systems and we will have to make sure that our education system and our health system respond locally to the needs of the refugees.  These needs are complex, as anybody who has met Syrian refugees in this country or any group of families will know.  Young men who have spent four or five years in refugee camps and are now trying to rebuild their lives have very complex health needs.  We have met the Departments of Health and Education and Skills to ensure we have a proper response to all these issues.<\/p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's frustration and that she wants to do more but the work is under way and we will meet our commitments.  We are meeting them now in an accelerating way.  The Deputy also asked about family reunification, for which people who arrive here are eligible.  Many of the 4,000 who are arriving are families and a ratio is built into the system for applications made for family reunification on the part of people whose families are not with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#R00400","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I wish to correct the record on one point.

There is a target for 4,000 refugees to be brought in under the Irish refugee protection programme.  So far, 439 have come from Lebanon.  The quota for 2016 of 500 is expected to be reached.  Up to 260 refugees will be added to that in the first half of 2017.  All of these developments are welcome.<\/p> <p>  However, when we look at the Greek situation, my information is that, up to last week, we have 69 Syrians with 40 more cleared for arrival, as soon as the International Organisation for Migration has the travel arrangements made.  It is a small number in that regard.  The T&aacute;naiste touched on the Italian situation.  I am conscious of the efforts of officials and the Minister of State, the former Chairman of this committee, Deputy David Stanton, and wish them every success.  Deputy Daly is not just expressing a personal view.  There is a sense among many that we need to move up a gear.  I am of one mind with that.  I welcome the fact the T&aacute;naiste has said that is her intention and expectation.  We are not at loggerheads here but about getting the job done.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of unaccompanied minors, I note the T&aacute;naiste said Calais is not included under the Irish refugee protection programme.  Only last week, the French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, indicated he intends to disperse the thousands congregated in the Calais camp in three weeks to 164 new and different locations across France.  There are a significant number of young children and minors at this camp.  We know up to 10,000 minors have disappeared across Europe, are untraceable and we are not able to determine what has happened to them.  We have questions about a number of minors and children who presented in Ireland and it is not known where they are.  My concern is that this dispersal planned by the French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, will add to that number and we will lose young people and knowledge about them into the ether.  Is there anything we can do about this specific cohort of unaccompanied minors?<\/p> <p>  The House of Commons recently passed an amendment to its Immigration Bill, tabled by the Labour peer, Lord Alf Dubs, committing the British Government to accept a significant number of unaccompanied minors.  As to whether the current Prime Minister there, Theresa May, and her Government have shown any appetite to follow it through is another matter.  The critical point is that it has made the decision and it is passed into law.  Are any amendments required to existing legislation here that could contribute positively to our focusing with greater intent on the relocation of unaccompanied minors from across the various sites in Europe to Ireland?  It demonstrated itself in the neighbouring island.  Is there any such need regarding legislation on our Statute Book?<\/p> <p>  Tusla's preference in this regard is for the 13 to 15 year old age group.  We are advised that Ireland has requested four unaccompanied minors from Greece in the next tranche to be interviewed by Irish officials in October.  Deputy Daly indicated we have had only one from Greece so far.  Essentially, only one child has met the requested profile.  Is the requested profile prepared and presented by Tusla?  Is it limited to age or are there other factors involved in the profile?  Do other factors militate against other children coming to our shores?  Is there anything that can be done in a re-examination of Tusla's preference which might accommodate a greater take-up?  Can the T&aacute;naiste offer us any information in this regard?  It is to be hoped we are all on the one page in terms of our collective intent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#S00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Both the Chairman and other Deputies are pointing out the huge vulnerability of unaccompanied minors caught up in the refugee crisis and who disappear in the system.  I know this is a significant concern internationally.  They are difficult to identify in the first place and clearly are not being registered.  Accordingly, it is difficult to reach out to them and ensure we can take them in Ireland or elsewhere.  The UK decided it would not participate in relocation.  It is introducing its own measures and is involved in resettlement by taking people from the refugee camps.<\/p> <p>  The French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, has recognised the situation in Calais is intolerable and unsustainable.  The people there, for the most part, want to go on to the UK.  He has signalled his intention to disband the camp completely and have the people living there provided with accommodation in other parts of France.<\/p><p>Many people will welcome this because, given what we have all seen, the situation there is intolerable.  The migrants in Calais have the same rights to apply to the French authorities for asylum as they would have in Ireland.  Many want to travel to the UK.<\/p><p> We are focusing our resources in the areas of greatest need.  We are taking people from, for example, the camps in Lebanon.  Lebanon has taken in the equivalent of one third of its population, as has Jordan.  A large percentage of people in Lebanon are refugees.  There is a huge need to take people from its camps.  That is what we have done and by the end of the year, several hundred will have come from there.<\/p><p> As we must under the EU agreement, we are prioritising our focus on asylum seekers in Greece, given the large scale of the problem on its islands and mainland.  I meet the Greek justice Minister regularly at the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  Greece wants us to do this and we have made it clear that we are prepared to take hundreds more refugees.  That is our policy.  This work will accelerate.  Now that the system is working more effectively in Greece, people are registering because they cannot go to Sweden or Germany in the same way as before.  A part of the context that we need to understand is that people were simply moving through Europe.  That has stopped because individual countries have taken action.  Our focus must be on the programme to which we are committed, as opposed to Calais.  From a foreign affairs point of view, though, there will be discussions on the issue between the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the relevant Ministers in France and I will bring the committee's concern to his attention.<\/p><p> To answer the Chairman's question on unaccompanied minors, there are no legislative barriers.  We do not need any legislation to address this issue.  It is a question of identifying the unaccompanied minors.  The age issue is not a barrier because we and Tusla will take any children who are under 18 years of age.  Age is only a barrier in so far as many of those who were named as unaccompanied minors turned out on investigation to be much older, but that is a different issue.  Tusla is committed to taking some unaccompanied minors.  Many children are coming to Ireland as a part of family groups, but our people on the ground in Lebanon and those who will return to Greece are making it clear that we will take unaccompanied minors.  We have done that from the beginning.  The process has been slow for everyone, but we are committed to taking unaccompanied minors as part of the broader group.  If they can be identified to us and Tusla can respond, I hope those numbers will increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#S00600","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

The D&aacute;il and Seanad have referred it to the joint committee to seek the approval of both Houses to opt into the proposal for a recast of the Brussels IIa regulation to allow judicial co-operation in the EU in respect of cross-border matrimonial and parental responsibility and child abduction cases.  It is a good regulation and contains provisions to determine which member states are responsible for divorce, custody and access proceedings.  It ensures that judgments issued in one member state are recognised and enforced in another.  It sets out a procedure to settle cases where a parent takes a child from a member state without the other parent's agreement.  Cases like this will have been brought to many committee members' attention.<\/p> <p>  A network of central authorities deals with this matter.  The Brussels IIa regulation applies only in cross-border cases within the EU and would not apply in cases where the members of a couple are Irish nationals who both are habitually resident in Ireland.  It relates only to the procedural aspects of cross-border cases.  Importantly, it does not affect substantive law, for example, the legal requirements for obtaining a divorce.<\/p> <p>  An analysis of the regulation has been conducted and a consultation process was undertaken.  This is about quicker and simpler procedures in the context of an increasing number of EU cross-border custody cases as well as child abduction cases arising from marital breakdowns.  The review is timely.<\/p> <p>  Article 20 proposes that a child who was capable of forming his or her view would be guaranteed an opportunity to express it in proceedings on custody, access and the return of children abducted by one of their parents.  This is a welcome proposal, given that our Constitution now contains the provision that the view of the child should be heard in such proceedings.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of other articles, all of which are intended to ensure that processes in these difficult matters work across borders.  The proposal will have some operational and resource implications for various bodies, including the central authority, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service.  These will be examined as the negotiations on the proposal continue.  It is a measure under Title V of Part 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The legal basis is Article 81.3, which provides for a special legislative procedure for judicial co-operation in family matters.<\/p> <p>  I am of the view that we should opt into the discussions, which will maximise our ability to influence the final outcome.  There are no policy reasons of a pressing nature that would suggest we should not opt in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#T00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Are there views that members would like to express?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2016100500002#T00600","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I welcome this proposal.

The Minister's opening statement has been circulated to members.  I invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement.  When he has concluded, I will ask the members to respond in groups of three.  Members are limited to a maximum of a three minute contribution and I ask that the Minister also limits his responses to that time in order for the committee to cover as much ground as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#C00300","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  As time is limited, I will try to be as brief as possible with my answers.  I thank the members for their invitation to appear before the committee this morning for what I know will be an interesting and, hopefully, productive exchange of views.  The committee has invited me here to talk about the future for public transport and on the levels of subvention.  I will outline my thoughts on these matters and look forward to discussing them with members.  Members will be aware that the programme for a partnership Government contains a commitment to review public transport policy, to which I will return later, and I hope that today is the beginning of an ongoing dialogue with committee members as regards the future of public transport policy.<\/p> <p>  First let us look at transport generally and what is at the core of public transport policy.  It is about having a system that allows people and goods to move efficiently, sustainably and safely between places they need to go.  It is about people getting from home to work, to school and to social activities.  It is about alleviating the impacts of congestion in our urban areas and enabling goods to move to markets.  It is also about enabling sustainable travel choices and contributing to a more sustainable future.  Having an efficient, value-for-money and accessible transport system is critical to underpin economic growth and to enable social and economic development for the future.  Those objectives require the development of an accessible, integrated, well-funded, high-quality and efficient public transport system that delivers real value for money for both the taxpayer and the fare-paying passenger.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, transport policy-makers and planners have grappled with better integrating the transport system to allow for more efficient mobility in order that our economy can continue to grow and develop and that quality of life can be enhanced.  In Dublin and the provincial cities, we can see positive initiatives to improve public transport integration with walking and cycling.  We have also seen the roll out of integrated ticketing, real time passenger information and journey planning which all serve to improve flexibility and choice for customers who must be at the heart of how we continue to improve the service offering.<\/p> <p>  Consider how public transport is organised in Ireland.  In recent years, there have been great improvements to the way public transport is organised and delivered in Ireland.  The major impetus behind these recent changes is the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  It established the National Transport Authority, NTA, and lays out the legal framework for how public transport is organised, financed and delivered.  As Minister, I retain responsibility for transport policy and priorities for delivery.  I provide an aggregate amount of money each year to the NTA and other agencies to fund service delivery.  I have certain statutory functions in relation to the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  I am the shareholder for CIE and its subsidiaries.  On a statutory basis, the NTA enters into contracts with public service obligation, PSO, operators.  It regulates those PSO services and allocates funding to PSO operators.  The NTA licenses and regulates commercial services, develops integrated ticketing and promotes public transport generally.<\/p> <p>  The regulatory framework for public transport is based on EU law and, like all other member states, we now have a dedicated transport focused authority working with, and allocating funding to, the transport operators.  The NTA will tell the committee more about its approach to this task.  It is important to note that the public transport system as we know it today is effectively made up of three services - public service obligation services, commercial licensed services and the rural transport programme.  The NTA regulates the PSO and commercial services on a statutory basis and administers the rural transport programme on a non-statutory basis under agreement with my Department.<\/p> <p>  A key element in delivering any public service is the funding of that delivery.  Public transport is basically funded through two sources - the passenger and the taxpayer.  During the 2010 to 2012 period, there were some significant fare increases, which were imposed to assist with the financial crisis which engulfed all three CIE companies during the economic downturn when passenger levels fell in line with the fall off in employment levels.  However, that period is now behind us.  The NTA's fares policy in the last few years is part of a medium-term plan to overhaul the complex and different levels and types of fares and move toward a more streamlined system that will encourage greater use of public transport services.  With regard to the second major source of funding, Government will this year provide approximately &euro;595 million to fund our public transport system.  That comprises &euro;236 million in PSO funding, &euro;346 million in capital funding and almost &euro;12 million for the rural transport programme.  The total amount of Government spending must be taken into account if we are to have a real discussion on how public transport is funded.  One cannot fund new buses without funding new services just as one cannot fund new services without new buses.  I know that comparisons of PSO subsidy levels are frequently raised but the point I have just made is an important caveat to any quick conclusions, which are sometimes drawn.  A recent report for the European Commission highlighted the numerous difficulties faced when attempting to accurately benchmark PSO subsidy levels across different countries.  I welcome this year's 13% increase in PSO funding and can assure members I am looking to secure further increases for next year, as may be possible within the overall budgetary position.  I would like to invest more in public transport but I have to recognise that there are huge demands elsewhere for scarce resources, including in housing, health, education, etc.  However, I am clear that any increase in PSO funding should prioritise improvements in the delivery and quality of services.  I hope that all members would share the view that if we are to provide more taxpayers' money, we must be able to demonstrate the value for money of that expenditure.<\/p> <p>  What is the future of public transport?   Right now across Government there are a number of important initiatives under way which will heavily influence the future of public transport.  First and foremost, there is the development of the national planning framework.<\/p><p>I do not think it is possible to overstress the importance of that work to our transport system.  <\/p><p> Additionally, important work that is under way in the area of climate change will have important consequences for the future direction of the transport sector.  I recently received a copy of a rail review conducted by the NTA in co-operation with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, which examines the funding parameters required to support our rail network now and into the future.  I am currently considering its conclusions and I expect to make a decision on the next steps shortly.  As I mentioned at the outset, a programme for a partnership Government commits to a review of public transport policy to ensure services are sustainable into the future and meet the needs of a modern economy.  I will consult my Department later in the year on how best to make progress with that commitment.  I believe this committee will play a crucial role in the development of the revised policy.<\/p><p> In recent months, I have met many stakeholders with an interest in public transport.  Those meetings, together with the many different issues raised during Oireachtas business, have allowed me to develop a sense of the essential needs of the public transport sector.  As a result of these deliberations, I intend to ensure the interests of commuters and taxpayers are at the heart of public transport policy and our public transport system.  I will also consider the conclusions of the rail review and its implications for our rail network and develop our overall public transport investment programme in line with the principles of the strategic investment framework for land transport and in the context of the overall Exchequer funding resources.  This will ensure value for money and improved outcomes for all stakeholders in the delivery of public transport services.  I look forward to working with this committee as we embark on our work on these issues in the coming months and years.  I thank the members of the committee again for inviting me to address them.  I look forward to their questions and to our discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#C00400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>As agreed, I will begin by calling Deputies Troy, Munster and Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#D00200","speaker":"1318"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to this morning's meeting.  It is funny to note that the first three pages of his presentation gave us a history of public transport.  In the final pages of his presentation, he spoke about plans and next steps.  He committed to examining a review, consulting his Department later in the year on a revised policy and working on climate change.  I am somewhat disappointed that we have heard no specifics, no vision and no indication of where the Minister is coming from as he takes responsibility for this incredibly important brief.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask a number of specific questions.  I hope the Minister will keep his reply specific.  Does he feel the rate of subvention is adequate?  The Minister has said today, as he did in previous committee meetings, that he would like to see an increase in that subvention.  Can he indicate what he would consider to be an appropriate level of subvention for our State companies?  Will conditions be attached to any increase they receive?  Will an increased level of subvention have to be accompanied by an improvement in services, by additional services or by investment in buses and trains, etc.?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said he cannot overstress the importance of the national planning framework.  Can he give us a timeline for that framework?  Can he tell us what role the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is playing in that regard?<\/p> <p>  The Minister did not mention the review of the school transport network even though it is an integral part of the activities of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I understand it has been operating on a cost recovery basis whereby the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport pays Bus &Eacute;ireann exactly what it costs.  Can the Minister confirm whether any profit has been made on the school transport system?  If it has, then school transport is subsiding Bus &Eacute;ireann at the moment.  When will a review of school transport take place?  Anyone who represents a rural constituency will know just how inefficient the routes are at present.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that transport will be competing with major issues like housing and education.  Does he agree that public transport has a fundamental role to play in helping to solve the housing crisis and, on that basis, we should be able to get an increased allocation for capital expenditure to improve our public transport infrastructure?  We need to make sure there is an efficient and reliable public service to bring those who have to live on the outer limits of Dublin into the capital.<\/p> <p>  What level of interaction has the Minister had to date with Bus &Eacute;ireann regarding the proposal to hive off the Expressway service and diminish the terms and conditions of the workers?  In my opinion, this will run the risk of leaving provincial towns and villages in rural Ireland without a public transport service in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#D00300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.  He said that the objectives of the public transport system \"require the development of an accessible, integrated, well-funded, high-quality and efficient\" service.  I would like to compare the document on the future of public transport, to which the Minister referred, to the statement that was given to the unions representing Bus &Eacute;ireann workers in the past couple of weeks.  They were told that structural changes would involve separating Expressway services from the rest of the public transport network.  Workers were also told that their pay and conditions would be changed.  In any other language, that is a privatisation agenda.  We know about the decision to allow 10% of the market to be put out to public tender as part of that agenda.  Is this the start of the privatisation of our public transport network?  It has been suggested that the 2,600 workers and the fleet of 800 buses in the Expressway system will be separated out.  Is this part of the privatisation of public transport?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said in his statement that he is responsible for transport policy.  Is this part of his policy?  Is he in favour of going down the road of privatising our public transport network?  It has been suggested, particularly in the context of the Dublin Bus strike, that the workers are the only people who have not benefitted from the upturn since 2013-14.  Those who have an ideology of pure privatisation can adopt a myopic mindset or view.  It is better to adopt a long-term strategy of public investment to deliver a first-class public transport service that can be accessed by everyone in every town and village in the State.  The State will eventually reap the long-term benefits of investment in delivery.  I am extremely worried that the Minister's policy to date is favouring a privatisation agenda.  What does he think about the statement that was made to the unions about privatising our entire Expressway service?<\/p> <p>  It has been said that the rural transport programme is under review.  Is the Minister of State aware of the issues that have been identified in that review?  What actions have been taken to date?  Will the rural transport programme be secured as the programme it was set up to be?  The intention is that people in rural areas who have no other means of transport can access rural transport services under the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#D00400","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I will not say much about the Dublin Bus dispute except briefly to congratulate the workers on achieving the 3% offer.  However, the Minister's failure to increase the State subvention has complicated the ballot because workers are asking where the money to fund the claim will come from.  There is a concern that if it is not funded from the State, workers will be made to pay through the back door.  Ministers felt last week that the Garda pay claim was wrapped up, but the Garda Representative Association, GRA, rejected the proposals, and it would be a mistake on the part of Ministers to feel that the Dublin Bus issue is wrapped up now.  A similar result in that ballot cannot be ruled out.<\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann management plans to separate out the Expressway operation and slash the wages and conditions of the workforce.  The Minister has denied that he gave the green light for this so this morning, at this committee, he has an opportunity.  The question is this: is he prepared to say that Bus &Eacute;ireann management's actions are a real upping of the ante in the race to the bottom, that they are provocative and that he dissociates himself entirely from them?  The model in Bus &Eacute;ireann has clearly failed.  The issuing of new licences and the amending of existing licences have damaged Expressway to the point of it being unsustainable.  The commercial bus market has reached saturation point in respect of the number of operators and routes and is now in need of urgent review.  I ask his opinion on that.  I also ask him to comment on the fact that private operators can regularly breach the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 with little or no punishment, yet State operators must stringently abide by it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said in his introductory remarks that in recent years there has been great improvement in public transport.  Many people listening to this would shake their heads in wonder at that statement.  The State subvention has been slashed across the board year after year for eight or nine years now.  I will not go into all the facts and figures, but the 2007 State subvention to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was &euro;195 million; last year it was &euro;98 million - cut in half.  For Dublin Bus, the subvention fell from &euro;86 million to &euro;58 million between 2008 and 2015 - cut by a third.  For Bus &Eacute;ireann, the subvention fell from &euro;49 million to &euro;34 million - cut by 30%.  Public transport is at a breaking point.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann does not have enough to maintain current services or rolling stock, let alone to expand operations.<\/p> <p>  The Minister correctly said in his opening statement that public transport is vital to combat congestion and assist the environment and that what is needed is a vision of improved public transport services.  However, given those stats, that cannot be done by tweaking; it needs a massive increase in the State subvention.  If we say that health and education are public services and we fund them accordingly, we must do so as well with public transport, very much the poor relation at the moment.  At least &euro;170 million would be needed simply to bring Dublin's bus services up to the European average.  Is the Minister prepared to fight for increases of that kind?  Does he have sufficient vision to aim that high?<\/p> <p>  I want to ask in particular about a cut in the State subvention regarding payments from the Department of Social Protection to CIE to cover the free travel scheme.  I understand that these transfers, incredibly, are based on a passenger survey carried out in 1973.  I also understand that payments have been frozen since 2011.  In 2011, there was a transfer of &euro;76 million for the free travel scheme, but passenger numbers that year were 726,000.  In 2015, they were 842,000.  That is an increase of 16%, but there has not been a 16% increase in the payments, which indicates that, to a greater or lesser extent because it is not exact, CIE is down in the region of 16%.  That is a further &euro;12 million slashed from the budgets.  That should be addressed, and I ask the Minister for his comments on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#E00100","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I will deal with Deputy Troy's questions first.  He continually looks for what he calls a vision for transport from me.  There are two ways of considering this.  In the transport sector, there is the long-term vision and the short-term problems, and they are very closely related.  The long-term vision, obviously, must be considered not achievable in a very short period of time because of the extraordinary demands on the Exchequer and the extraordinary way in which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport eats up the money allocated to us every year.  In the short term, the outlook is obviously less fortunate and less rosy than the long term.  The long-term vision is there in all the great projects which members see and which have been laid out many times before the committee.  They are to deal with the accelerating demands in the transport sector from people who need services.<\/p> <p>  It is mainly in Dublin, but not exclusively, that the huge commitments have been made in the long-term capital plan to meet those demands which face us.  I refer to Metro North, DART Underground and all those projects, which have not been shelved but have been postponed because of the extraordinary demands of the financial crash.  They have been mentioned so often before but they will be mentioned again, and I mention them now.  All these are going ahead and are part of the vision we have which must work within the limitations of the financial stringencies we have.  If Deputy Troy wants to come to me at any time - thank God we have conversations about these things - with proposals as to how these could be funded at an earlier date and where the money would come from, I would be the first to welcome them and credit him with those proposals.  I have no problem with that whatsoever, but that long-term vision is certainly there.  However, let us be honest about it that it will not be achieved overnight.  No government, whether Deputy Troy is in government or I am in government, will achieve it overnight.  However, the vision is there, those commitments are there and they will be achieved within the projections that we have.  The short-term problems are ones of which we are all acutely aware and which we are tackling very adequately within those budgets which are available to us.<\/p> <p>  Is the subvention adequate?  The answer is \"No, it is not\".  It would be wonderful if it were higher.  I think it has gone up by 13% this year after several years of falling.  I have been in negotiations, as I am sure Deputy Troy knows, about the Estimates and I hope we will be able to improve the subvention on a gradual but consistent basis in the years to come.  Of course it is not adequate.  I would like it to be a lot larger.  Our plans have had to be put off several times but they are there, and the subvention, along with other forms of funding and the direct investments, are commitments which we hope to be able to fulfil.  However, the subvention is not enough.  It is nothing like enough.  It would be much better if it were higher.<\/p> <p>  The national planning framework is due to report, I think, in the near future.  I am not sure of the exact date, but the Department has a role in that and a member on its steering committee.<\/p><p> The national planning framework is a successor to the national spatial strategy and provides a blueprint for development in Ireland for the next 20 years.  It is an absolutely vital part of what we do and it is vital for planning transport.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, is leading this work and the cross-departmental group has been established.  I understand a public consultation document is being considered by that group with a view to a full public consultation on that.  We will have a very important input because transport and national planning frameworks are very closely integrated.<\/p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann made a presentation to me on 12 September, if I have the date wrong forgive me, and told me about the work in progress.  I gave no indication of approval or disapproval.  It told me the dire state in which it found itself and I listened.  I did not approve or disapprove any plans it might have had.  It did not have a completed plan of any sort.  It was simply reporting to me what was going on.  That is the extent of the interaction I had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#E00200","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Can the Minister clarify his position on the plans to cut the wages and conditions now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#F00200","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I will come back to that point later.

There is a cost of living driver in that respect and a point of diminishing returns if people opt to use their cars when it becomes less cost efficient to use public transport.<\/p><p>In turn, we must pick up for this with hard cash under our climate obligations.  I would have expected some of these issues to be addressed in the Minister's strategy for the future of public transport.  Cost of living increases will drive wage demands.  Since they have many effects, it is important to get the strategy right.<\/p><p> Previously, the Minister told us there were two ways of funding public transport, namely, the public service obligation, PSO, levy and increasing bus and train fares.  The subvention increase really only restores some of what was cut.  In 2013, 2014 and 2015, the degree to which the PSO levy included operators other than Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus increased.  Subventions increased from &euro;27 million to &euro;174 million to &euro;228 million.  I am sorry - those figures are in thousands.

It would have been prudent of him to ask a few questions of it.  For example, had the company tried to develop a business plan to enhance, promote and get more people using the Expressway service?  Why did he not ask these questions?<\/p> <p>  I have a wider question on the vision for public transport.  If it is about being a public service, why does Bus &Eacute;ireann keep referring to it as a product?  Expressway is a product to Bus &Eacute;ireann, not a service.  We must change that language.  If we do not, we will revert to the scenario mentioned by another member of a swathe of towns, villages and less-populated areas being left without a service, rather than a product.  That matters to the development of rural Ireland, the sustainability of communities and, to a greater extent, to the question of the environment and climate change.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and it strikes me that, instead of the Minister thinking one way and the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment thinking another way, they need to bang their heads together and consider ways of getting cars off the roads, improving the public transport system and improving Ireland's failed record in reducing carbon emissions.  Anybody travelling on the motorways can see bumper-to-bumper traffic with one person in each car because public transport is inadequate and unattractive, is not really public and is, by stealth, being privatised.  If the National Transport Authority, NTA, keeps giving licences to private operators, it will make it impossible for the public service company, Bus &Eacute;ireann, to deliver a decent service.  That is why the Minister should have questioned Bus &Eacute;ireann about whether it had a business plan to promote its services so that it might compete effectively.  He should also question the number of licences that the NTA is willingly giving to private transport companies, thereby pushing Bus &Eacute;ireann into this difficult position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#G00500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make a contribution and I welcome the Minister.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise two issues briefly.  Regarding the rail review, the programme for Government referred to ensuring services were sustainable into the future and meeting the needs of a modern economy.  Specifically, that has to do with making Irish Rail attractive.  I use Irish Rail, taking the rail link from Limerick to Dublin frequently.  Two aspects of its efficiency and attractiveness are lacking - broadband coverage is dire and mobile phone coverage is worse.  If we are trying to encourage business people and others who are able to contribute to use public transport, we must provide modern facilities.  The PSO ensures that older people and other categories can get public transport around the country.  I ask the Minister to raise these matters with Irish Rail.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the need for a proper road network, specifically relating to a matter I have raised with the Minister previously, namely, the recommencement of work on the M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick.  The fact that we do not have a proper motorway between the two largest cities outside of Dublin beggars belief in a modern economy.<\/p><p>It is also about making it attractive.  Anybody who has travelled the route between Cork and Limerick by bus knows the hazards of going through Buttevant and other places.  I have raised this previously but will the Minister consider reactivating the scheme in a small way, initially by reactivating the planning process?  It stalled in November 2011.  That would allow consultants to be appointed by Transport Infrastructure Ireland so they can get the process under way again.  That could be done prior to the mid-term review which will happen next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#G00600","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":478,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Murphy talked about the PSO private operators.

It is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services, namely, bus, rail, light rail and taxi, by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.

These include the assignment of responsibility to the authority for integrated local and rural transport, including provision of the rural transport programme.<\/p> <p>  The vision of the National Transport Authority, as set out in its statement of strategy, is a greater share of high-quality, accessible, sustainable public transport services being used by all.  This forms the basis of all the work the authority undertakes.  It has a statutory function to produce a transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, which includes the four Dublin council areas and counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  The GDA transport strategy for the period 2016 to 2035 was approved by the Minister earlier this year.  It sets out how the vision for greater use of sustainable transport services could be delivered by 2035, allowing also for a 29% increase in transport demand in that period.  The strategy outlines the heavy and light rail network, the core bus network and a supporting cycling network, as well as other demand management measures that are necessary to ensure 55% of the trips to work in 2035 will be made by using sustainable modes.  While the authority has no statutory function to provide strategic plans outside the GDA, it has developed a suite of transport models which would allow us to do so.  It has worked with Galway City Council on the Galway transport strategy and is actively engaged with the other regional city authorities in planning for sustainable transport services.<\/p> <p>  The authority is responsible for securing the provision of public bus services through two specified mechanisms: public service contracts, where services would not otherwise be provided on a commercial basis, and the licensing of public bus services which are operated on a commercial basis.  Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are contracted to the authority to provide public transport services.  The authority is also contracted with TII to Transdev Ireland Limited for the provision of Luas services, while there are a number of bus services provided under contract to the authority by other private operators across the State.  The authority has been working to improve public transport services since its establishment, supported by Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  The authority commenced a series of network reviews across all of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s services.  Starting with the regional cities, a number of network changes were made which resulted in increased passenger numbers at a time of declining passenger numbers on other services.  Some results are outlined in table 1 in the pack members have received.  They will see that, between 2013 and 2015, passenger numbers in Cork increased by 14%, in Galway by 4.7%, in Limerick by 2.9% and in Waterford by 2.4%. <\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann's stage carriage service between rural towns is still in the process of being restructured on a county by county basis.  In south Kerry an amended network of services has been implemented, while some revisions have been implemented in County Mayo and more are scheduled by the end of 2016.  Reconfigurations of the network of services on the M2-N2 corridor approach to Dublin have been implemented and those planned for the M3 will follow before the end of 2016.<\/p> <p>  The objective of the rural transport programme is to provide a good quality, nationwide, community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs.  In 2016 funding of &euro;13.7 million was provided through the authority for the programme, which represented a 16% increase in the annual funding for the programme.  With the benefit of this local collaboration, we expect to make considerable progress throughout 2016 in refining and expanding, where appropriate, the operation of local transport services, in addition to ensuring the optimal level of integration with other public transport services.  There are 41 new rural transport services being examined by the authority across the State, with a number of local link offices.  The planned services also include new town services in Cavan, Ennis, Mullingar, Kilkenny and Letterkenny.  With the additional funding, the authority has been able to provide 13 additional services in counties Kerry, Wexford, Leitrim and Roscommon, ensuring better connections to and between local towns to key destinations such as shops, hospitals and community facilities.  The authority is developing a three-year strategy for the development of rural transport services which will see further expansion of services and further integration with HSE transport services, subject to funding being received.  The authority is working to simplify the fares structure for bus and rail services and offer integrated fare products across the State. The introduction of the LEAP card has greatly facilitated such integration.  Our vision for fares is for a further simplified, better value fares offer for the public transport customer.  The authority is examining what the next generation of smart ticketing might be for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The authority has had a multi-modal national journey planner in operation for over four years.  This allows anyone to plan his or her journeys to and from any location in Ireland by public transport.  It has been continually improved by our system developers and a new version of the journey planner app has just been launched in the app stores.  Real-time passenger information has greatly enhanced the experience of the public transport customer and the authority would like to expand on that system by erecting more signs and developing real-time travel alerts for customers as they travel.<\/p> <p>  The first real return to growth in passenger numbers across all public transport services occurred in 2014.  The demand for public transport services continued to grow in 2015 as illustrated in the table.  To date in 2016, passenger numbers have continued to grow, with estimated outturn growth of between 5% and 8% expected by the end of the year.  Demand for travel services is on the increase and the level of patronage on public transport services is growing.  This trend of increased overall demand is expected to continue and accelerate with further economic recovery and population growth envisaged in the next five years.  Public transport service provision must anticipate this growth and additional service provision should occur in a timely manner to influence mode choice associated with the increased levels of demand, particularly arising from new developments and new employment opportunities.  This will assist in maximising the public transport market share and national policy aims to increase mode share for sustainable travel services.  It is unlikely that all such demands can be met within existing service provision and capacity, particularly within the city and urban networks where population growth will be highest, and where existing peak capacity is already well used.  The authority will continue to work to improve existing public transport services and provide additional services to meet the growing demand within the budget it receives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for the invitation to attend.  I understand the committee has requested that I focus on the vision for public transport and the level of State subvention.  My opening statement will reflect this request.<\/p> <p>  An efficient public transport system is key to delivering positive economic and social development in the country and, in the case of Dublin Bus, Dublin and its hinterland, in particular.  An economically vibrant Dublin is also of benefit to the wider economy.  In order to outline a vision it is important to, first, reflect on the recent journey to where we are.  Dublin Bus operates under a direct award contract to provide services on all of its public service obligation network.  It is a net cost contract in that Dublin Bus has both revenue responsibility and to deal with associated risk.  This type of contract is the most used in large European cities and is provided for under EU directive 1370\/2007.  <\/p> <p>  Our most recent contract was signed in December 2014 for a period of five years.  Creating a customer-centric, well functioning and efficient public transport network is our ultimate aim and it can be achieved through a direct award contract.  There are many performance criteria which are independently audited in the contract and Dublin Bus has a strong record in exceeding its targets.  The performance criteria outlined in the contract targets areas that benefit the customer experience considerably.  By consistently exceeding our targets, we have been able to grow our business in a sustainable, efficient and customer focused manner.  Dublin Bus remains the largest public transport operator in Ireland.  In 2015 it carried 122 million passengers in operating over 57 million km on 112 routes.  We achieved these figures through strong growth on both the commercial and public service obligation network of services.<\/p> <p>  Dublin Bus customers account for 39% of the retail spend in Dublin city and 62% of all public transport users in Dublin are Dublin Bus customers.  Our network speed at peak times is the region of 14 km\/h, with substantial variances on all transport corridors.  Despite the significant roll-out of quality bus corridors, private transport services remain extremely competitive in terms of journey times to the city and, in many cases, are faster than the bus.  In many areas of Dublin private transport services are an attractive alternative to public transport services.  <\/p> <p>  Dublin Bus, with many other companies, felt the impact of the recession.  In 2013 it returned to profitability for the first time since 2008, with an operating surplus of &euro;500,000 on total revenues of &euro;268.6 million.  This profitability continued into 2014 and 2015, with an operating surplus of &euro;11.6 million and &euro;10.9 million, respectively, on total revenues of &euro;266.4 million and &euro;286.2 million, respectively, helped by a return to growth in our revenues, coupled with the implementation of cost reduction measures throughout the company.<\/p><p>Our fare box coverage - customer generated revenue as a percentage of total revenue - remains one of the highest in Europe, averaging 78% in the past three years.  This performance has been achieved against the backdrop of an annual cash cycle, with many agencies competing for the naturally limited current and capital funding available.  This is an annual challenge for all concerned in the delivery of public transport services, from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the National Transport Authority, CIE and Dublin Bus.  However, significant progress has been made while operating in this budget cycle.<\/p><p> One of the key benefits of the bus is that the service is flexible.  A bus network can quickly match resources with demand, as Dublin Bus proved after 2008 by reducing the scale of its activities by more than 20% to reflect the impact of the recession.  As the early signs of economic recovery appeared, the company was in a position to quickly re-adapt to increasing demand.  In line with the general recovery, our activities have since increased by more than 12%.  This growth continues at a rate of between 5% and 7%.  We must ensure we do not leave people waiting at our bus stops and stations.  Additional capacity introduced will benefit the city in the long term and introduce new customers to public transport.  It is significantly easier to introduce a customer to public transport than to convert a customer from private transport.  The youth of today are the future users of public transport and have a strong appetite for multiple transport travel options that exclude car ownership.  We must meet their future needs now.<\/p><p> Flexibility also applies to the ability to meet the aspirations of a city and its people.  Dublin is undergoing significant change, with the ongoing construction of the Luas cross-city project.  Throughout this period Dublin Bus has been able to adapt services and minimise the impact on customers.  This has been achieved in a congested city in which we have simultaneously increased customer numbers.<\/p><p> Congestion remains a problem in Dublin, particularly in the morning and evening peak commute times.  The city has narrow roads which were not designed to carry large volumes of vehicular traffic.  Many users are competing for the limited road space available, including private transport, that is, cars and motorcycles, public transport, cyclists, taxis, delivery vehicles and pedestrians.  As economic growth returns, congestion levels will increase further.  Congestion limits a city&rsquo;s ability to achieve its full potential in the economic, environmental, social and cultural areas.  Dublin is positioning itself as a modern European capital and a congested city does not fit with this outlook.<\/p><p> The changes I have outlined in the scale of our business were complemented by a total restructuring of our bus network, the largest of its kind in Europe.  In this period we also introduced significant enhancements of the customer experience, with the implementation of free Wi-Fi on all our buses; achieving the target of 100% accessible vehicles in our fleet; assisting in the roll-out of the Leap card and the national journey planner, in conjunction with the National Transport Authority; launching real-time passenger information and the Dublin Bus app, with more than 1 million downloads to date; and introducing Euro 6 engine vehicles which comply with the latest EU emission standards.  Dublin Bus has achieved these changes in unprecedented times through the prudent management of the resources available to it and, crucially, the commitment of all of its employees.  While the recent past has proved challenging for our customers and employees, there is an onus on all of us in Dublin Bus to ensure we provide continuity of the vital service we deliver.  Dublin Bus has a proud tradition of ensuring every journey matters for every customer.  This is something we will work hard to re-establish with our customers in the coming months and years.<\/p><p> I set out the current environment for public transport relating to Dublin Bus.  My vision for the future of public transport services in Dublin is clear.  It is a public transport network that is a better option than owning a car.  The public transport network of the future must have, after safety, three basic fundamentals in place, namely, frequency of service, reliability of service provision and competitive and consistent journey speeds.  Thereafter, information and price are key for customers.  Having a public transport system that is a better option than owning a car is a vision that is achievable and will enable the city to fulfil its potential in many diverse areas.  They include enhanced urban living opportunities, reduced congestion, improved air quality and reduced noise pollution.  Achieving this objective will enable the economy to prosper and provide a platform for a vibrant social and cultural city scene.  It will also increase capacity to deliver people to and from the city with reduced road space, increase the pedestrian environment in the city and enhance safety for all road users in the city.  These objectives can only be delivered by way of a multi-modal mobility platform as opposed to a single means of public transport.<\/p><p> In short, the public transport network comprises many transport options, including bus, coach, bus rapid transport, buses which offer a high level of service, rail, metro, bicycle, taxi, car share and light rail.  We must make the transport experience as simple as possible for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>As the presentation has been circulated to members, we will take the rest of it as read.

We work with the National Transport Authority to ensure city and rural stage carriage services are dovetailed with our commercial services and other public transport services to provide a vast integrated bus and coach network throughout the island.<\/p> <p>  Since emerging from the recession, Bus &Eacute;ireann has been delivering an average of 3% year on year growth in the number of customer journeys and last year carried slightly more than 37 million passengers on its road passenger services.  This figure excludes the 112,000 children we carry to school each day under the school transport scheme.  From 2009 to the end of 2015, on our public service contract routes, we delivered growth in revenue per kilometre of 20%, with only a 4% increase in cost per kilometre.  At the same time, State subvention was reduced by 26% per kilometre and the scale of our operations was delivered by 12% fewer staff than in 2009.  While this might point to greater efficiencies being achieved by the organisation in a difficult period, it broadsides the need for continuous investment in the fleet and facilities and the requirement to achieve new standards in customer service which requires a longer term investment framework.<\/p> <p>  While Bus &Eacute;ireann continues to expand its network and offer greater frequency and connectivity on services to improve its product, it needs steady State investment to underpin its growth ambitions.  Above all, we must ensure safety is never compromised and members of the public will continue to benefit from the continuous improvements in technology, training, fleet and facility standards in line with best practice in Europe.  We must keep pace and continue to invest for tomorrow&rsquo;s standards for the future.  All of these initiatives underpin our goal to be recognised as progressive and deliver on our mission to succeed by providing an excellent service for the public.<\/p> <p>  The financial difficulties we are experiencing on our commercial Expressway network which is not in receipt of a State subvention have been well publicised in recent weeks.  I have repeatedly shared during our visits to this forum in the past ten years our concerns about the impact of the motorways on smaller towns and villages.  I also advised the committee as recently as January this year that change was required to ensure the survival of Expressway routes across the country.  In addition to losses of &euro;5.3 million in 2015, we are forecasting losses of &euro;6 million in 2016 for Expressway.  The board and management have signalled that these losses cannot be allowed to continue and a solution must be found urgently.  While we have reduced our cost base by &euro;10 million or 20% since the recession started, new entrants on commercial routes with lower costs require us to be even more cost efficient to survive. <\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann continues to work with the National Transport Authority on the issue of commercial licensing to ensure a high level of and high quality inter-regional connectivity and balanced regional development.  However, we continue to make the point that the supply of services must be matched with demand on every corridor to ensure the market is structured in such a way as to ensure it is not only competitive but also financially sustainable.  It is not sufficient to focus on customer growth if the seat capacity provided is up to three times more than the level of demand on some corridors.  We have to focus on filling existing capacity first.<\/p> <p>  It is vitat that Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s public service obligation, PSO, services, are fully funded and provide a reasonable surplus to allow for service enhancement and investment.  In 2015 and 2016 we have delivered a significant expansion of our services, in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, and seen strong growth in passenger numbers emerging as a consequence.  We need more of this, as well as collaboration with local authorities to bring about modal shift to reduce congestion and continue to support local economies outside the greater Dublin area.  The PSO subvention for 2016 has been advised at &euro;37.9 million and we are grateful for a further increase of &euro;3 million received to date this year for the expansion of services sanctioned by the National Transport Authority.  However, this should be contrasted with the 2009 level of subvention of &euro;49.4 million.  No business can survive long term without generating a return and we are in discussions with the National Transport Authority on the return applicable to the public service contract.  The subvention for 2017 has not yet been agreed with the authority.  The company has assumed, however, that a subvention will be provided to meet the net cost of the PSO contract. <\/p> <p>  While Bus &Eacute;ireann has generated a range of cost efficiencies in recent years, the company also faces a number of potential cost increasing measures.  Pay rate pressures linked with the external environment and a pay rate freeze since 2008 present key challenges at this time.  Other cost increasing factors, however, include increased levels of congestion, our commitment to best practice in all safety related issues, the increasing culture of making claims and the associated increase in settlement costs and enhancements to customer services.<\/p><p> Taking all of this into account, we have articulated our vision for public transport with our stakeholders over recent years.  The primary objective for prioritising investment in public transport should be the role of transport in supporting renewed economic growth, improving competitiveness and sustaining job creation.  The evidence shows that public transport has a significant positive social impact, not just with regard to access to work or education but also with regard to access to health care, retail and leisure facilities and in facilitating tourism in urban and rural locations throughout Ireland.  All of these mobility and integration needs are critical to the sustainability and regeneration of local economies throughout the country.<\/p><p> Any investment framework should continue to place a priority on the maintenance of the integrated national network that links all communities, urban and rural, and that fosters balanced regional economic development.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has been at the heart of this for generations.  Balanced regional development should place a priority on lower cost alternatives such as a bus-coach transport network in a small island economy.  Communities outside Dublin need to be assured that they will not be isolated in terms of social and economic inclusion and international competitiveness.  While passenger growth is very strong on the core routes in provincial cities at present and investment in these networks should continue, further innovations such as bus rapid transit upgrades in cities like Cork and Galway should be examined.  This, together with infrastructural improvements to prioritise bus corridors, would help ease growing congestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Nolan to conclude.

First, I will give the committee an overview of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s operations.  This year, we will carry a projected 41.4 million passengers and 100 million tonne kilometres of freight.  We operate with a fleet of 638 carriages across a network of 1,700 kilometres and maintain both as well as 1,000 level crossings, 5,100 bridges, 4,900 cuttings and embankments and a range of buildings and structures which include 144 stations.  Every week our team of almost 3,800 people maintains this network and operates 4,300 passenger train services and 50 freight services.  Additionally, we are the port authority for Rosslare Europort, the State's second busiest port which handles 2.3 million tonnes of freight and 900,000 passengers annually.<\/p> <p>  In funding terms, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is divided into train operations and infrastructure management divisions, as required under EU directives.  The train operations division runs day-to-day train services which are largely funded through the fare box and PSO payments from the NTA.  The infrastructure management division maintains and invests in our network and is funded through multi-annual contract payments from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and from track access charges from train operators - largely our own train operation division but with some other operators, notably tourism and heritage operations such as the Belmond Grand Hibernian tour of Ireland, which has just started operating, and the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland.  Capital funding for major overhauls of our rolling stock and infrastructure renewal is essential.  It is needed to protect the value of our fleet and infrastructure assets for our customers and the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  In both areas of the business, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann continues to operate through an era of unprecedented challenge.  While business growth has made a very welcome return, the cumulative and continuing effect of operating losses and underfunding challenges our ability to operate sustainably and to maintain the levels of safety and service performance expected by our customers.  Annual PSO funding has reduced since 2007 from &euro;195 million to &euro;98 million.<\/p> <p>  Financially, notwithstanding reducing our cost base by more than &euro;73 million per annum during the economic crisis, we will again record a loss in 2016, albeit one that is better than forecast as a result of passenger growth.  This will bring our cumulative losses since 2008 to &euro;160 million.  Our balance sheet simply will not withstand further losses beyond 2016 without impacting on service levels, performance and safety maintenance.  Equally critical in terms of funding our operations and network, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in its strategic framework for investment in land transport and other reviews has identified a shortfall in annual funding of &euro;90 million for the network we operate and services we are contracted to provide.<\/p> <p>  I commend our team of dedicated employees on ensuring we continued to deliver services safely and reliably during this era.  However, as history has shown us, sustained underinvestment will ultimately impact on both safety and reliability and result in greater costs to renew our assets in the long run rather than maintain them sustainably.  For customers, this would mean a return to speed restrictions and a worsening of service standards when our ambition is to improve times and service quality.<\/p> <p>  We must address this underfunding to maintain our existing track, signalling and infrastructure assets and to keep pace with best European practice in safety management such as automatic train protection systems, which exist only on the DART network and which automatically prevent trains from passing red signals or from over-speeding and are commonplace across Europe.  Further investment in level crossing safety is needed following an era in which we halved the number on our network.  We have prioritised the renewal of our national train control centre.  We have worked and continue to work extremely closely with both the NTA and the Department to identify and address these challenges and I thank them for their support as we work towards a sustainable future for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  I will now move to our vision for the future.  As I have already stated, growth has returned to our network.  Passenger journeys, which fell from a high of more than 45 million in 2007 to 36.7 million in 2013, are projected to climb to 41.4 million this year.  In a growing economy, the strengths of a sustainably funded rail service are clear.  Rail can provide frequent, high-capacity public transport to address urban congestion, particularly in Dublin and Cork.  Rail can deliver fast inter-urban journey times between Dublin city centre and key cities and towns on the island of Ireland and ensure CO2 and other emissions from transport are dramatically reduced, thus helping the State meet European and United Nations Paris climate change agreement goals.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has already exceeded the Government's 2020 target for emission reduction for State bodies.  Rail can provide a competitive offering in both passenger and freight sectors, supporting a dynamic and growing economy and ensuring social inclusion.<\/p> <p>  To this end, our vision for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is to build a better future together by improving our services and growing our business.  One of our core values is putting the customer at the heart of our business and this is where our priorities lie for investment and service improvements.  We are committed to opening the Phoenix Park rail tunnel in the coming weeks for commuter services from the Kildare line to the stations between Connolly and Grand Canal Dock, initially at peak times before extending operations to off-peak times and weekends.  Our Customer First programme will address legacy ticketing and customer-interfacing systems to deliver modern, customer-friendly engagement, including customer relationship management systems, enhanced online offerings, yield management systems similar to the airline industry and more.  Other developments include the expansion of DART services to a ten minute frequency; incremental journey time improvements through ongoing line improvement works, initially between Hazelhatch and Portlaoise benefiting intercity customers to and from Cork, Limerick and Kerry; and the completion of re-signalling of the DART line between Clongriffin and Grand Canal Dock to allow more trains to operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Franks"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Franks to conclude.

We consider existing services and where the gaps are in those services.  We also look at whether we can improve services by better integration, which might come about through timetable changes and if there is a demand for additional frequency.

The Leap card was a key enabler as customers can jump between different modes of transport using the same ticket.  The operators in the National Transport Authority, NTA, have increased the integration of our own services within that timeframe.  Recently, we have seen that dublinbikes subscribers can use their Leap cards to use that service.  It is the next step.<\/p> <p>  Hanover essentially has mobility as a service and it is an application.  One can develop the technology and have an application to allow customers to pay for all services through one payment mechanism.  One can build in a number of transport options.  In Hanover there are taxis in the system as well.  Ultimately, the application calculates the best fare.  It is like a shared service so the customer can choose what he or she wants to pay every month.  A person might pick a transport option costing &euro;10 per week or it may be &euro;50 if that person uses the service more often.  The technology is a key aspect but it is enabled by all the operators working together.  There has been much work done on that are there will be discussions between the NTA and operators on the next iteration of Leap, which may move to account-based ticketing.  That would allow systems like that in Hanover to be introduced.  We have done some of the work and there is much we can do in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne"},{"type":"speech","time":1475654400,"counter":530,"content":"<p>It is hard to cover everything in a three-minute slot but I have engaged with most of our guests in the past.  I thank them for being here this morning.  The &euro;2 million profit was taken from Dublin Bus by the NTA because it was deemed as excessive profit.  I understand it is based on a return on equity model used to calculate excessive profits.  Will the witness comment on that?  I understand the model runs contrary to standard business practice.  Why does the NTA use it and would it not be deemed far more beneficial if the money could be left with Dublin Bus in order for it to improve services further?<\/p> <p>  The Expressway routes play a pivotal role in ensuring that many of our towns and communities outside large urban areas have public transport.  What is the NTA's view on a position where some of those routes would be transferred from being commercial services to being a public service obligation?  I understand the NTA has no formal power to refuse either a public or private operator from amending a commercial service route.  What could it do to prevent somebody from tendering for a route, being awarded that route but changing the route a couple of months afterwards, meaning it fails to service the stops originally identified?  It puts those operators at a unfair competitive advantage over Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Perhaps Mr. Nolan might address that as well?<\/p> <p>  There are upcoming tendering proposals for Dublin Bus.  Will Mr. Coyne give an update on the progress being made in opening existing Dublin Bus orbital routes to tender?

What evidence is Dublin Bus using to indicate that competitive tendering will improve cost efficiency or customer services?<\/p> <p>  According to an assessment by the National Transport Authority carried out in conjunction with Indecon in May 2011, DART underground was considered not just to be a transport scheme but an investment in the future growth of Ireland.  The NTA's new transport strategy for the greater Dublin nevertheless has hardly any mention of the project, which appears to have fallen off the agenda.  Will the witness comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Coyne mentioned that the youth of today are future public transport users.  What work is being done in trying to change behavioural attitudes and get more people on public transport?  I have posed this question before.

With regard to reasonable profit, the authority must operate in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1370\/2007.  We are required to establish provisions to avoid overcompensation in the case of directly awarded contracts for public transport services.  The regulation states that reasonable profit is the rate of return that is normal for the sector in a given member state that takes into account the risk or absence thereof incurred by the operator by virtue of the intervention.<\/p><p>We have reviewed the case law precedent and considered various methodologies for determining an appropriate rate of return and we concluded that the determination of reasonable profit, based on return on equity, is the most appropriate approach for a direct award contract.  In regard to the risk levels, they are not as high as would be considered in the commercial market.  We also ensured that it was consistent with previous EU Commission decisions concerning public transport services contracts, and this method of assessing reasonable profit has been used in other member states.<\/p><p> The reduction in profit of &euro;2 million for Dublin Bus was transferred to Bus &Eacute;ireann to offset the losses it was incurring in that same year.

Ms Graham said there was a review of the rural transport programme.  What issues were identified in the review and what actions have been taken on that?  Another issue is fares.  Given the steady rise in fares in recent years, has the NTA plans to increase fares further?  Ms Graham referred to the rise in capacity numbers since 2014.  How does the NTA expect to manage that increase in capacity?  Is the current subvention adequate?  Has it plans to expand the bus fleet?<\/p> <p>  In respect of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, does it intend to increase the number of carriages, particularly at peak times?  We all know that many trains are grossly overcrowded at peak times.  I raised that issue with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann previously but did not get a response on it.  I would have liked to hear an update on the tendering process for Dublin Bus.  I am referring to Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann but I am sure I should refer to the NTA; they are all the one now.  Mr. Franks mentioned the annual PSO funding for Irish Rail being reduced from &euro;195 million to &euro;98 million.  He had raised concerns about safety and service.  How can he assure the public that the service Irish Rail provides is safe given the staggering decrease in funding in the past seven years?<\/p><p>How can we be confident that it is providing that safe service?  Have any safety audits been carried out over recent years or as a result of lack of funding and, if so, what have been the results?<\/p><p> A matter which is a huge bone of contention is one which it is hard to credit is still happening in 2016.  I refer to the train from Belfast to Dublin.  We are trying to provide a service for a growing economy and to encourage public transport use.  That train does not get into Dublin before 9 a.m.  What other intercity rail service would be able to say that it could not get commuters from one city to another before 9 o'clock in the morning?  That has been ongoing.  Has anything been done to address that or is it being put on the long finger?<\/p><p> Looking at the Dublin Bus statement, I am glad that it acknowledges the contribution and commitment of the workers in returning the company to profit.  The workers' contribution in bringing Dublin Bus back to profit was instrumental.  It is acknowledged in the statement but it is something the company might say publicly at some stage to recognise their work and commitment.  Dublin Bus mentioned funding for the fleet in its opening statement.  Can Dublin Bus profits be used for that?  How underfunded is the fleet aspect of the service?<\/p><p> The following comes in under the NTA also, but Bus &Eacute;ireann recently announced the separation of the Expressway service not only from the rest of the service, but also to change workers' pay and conditions.  We have spoken about this many times before.  It is sometimes hard to credit that anybody can justify it given the experience of privatisation right across Europe and how it costs more for the public purse in the long run.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann has a vision, and it talked earlier about connectivity and providing a service and delivering for commuters and customers, how can it even begin to convince people that, if our Expressway service is put out for privatisation or given over to private companies to run, a private operator will not come in and cream off the most profitable routes and leave the least profitable routes abandoned?  That has happened the world over.  When we talk about rural inclusion and social inclusion, to attempt to do what Bus &Eacute;ireann is doing will isolate rural communities the length and breadth of the State.  It is something I would be opposed to and it shows a lack of vision on the part of the company.  I do not know if the company has asked the Minister for funding around that.  That is a catastrophe for our public transport network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#O01400","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>A number of years ago, we carried out a review of how rural transport was delivered and have now put in 17 local link offices which are on the ground working with local communities to try to develop rural transport services.  We are getting down into all those individual services and locations where there is a need for further service improvements.  It is a detailed service review, as in individual services, which is happening right across the State.  As funding becomes available and as new services or changes to services are justified, we will work with the local link offices to put those in place.  As I said, 13 have already gone in this year and we are looking at a further 40 this year alone.  We would like to increase that across the State.<\/p> <p>  In terms of fares, we had to respond in the downturn because of reduced funding, both in terms of subsidy and fare revenue, to ensure that services would continue by increasing fares, even though there was a discount associated with the leap card on offer at the same time.  Currently, our fare policy is to try to look at fare restructuring rather than, necessarily, fare increases.  That is about rebalancing fares across the State.  We found many anomalies among parts of the State in terms of services per km and we want to rebalance that so there is a fare structure for bus and rail services.  That is the work we will be doing across the next few years.  It will take a few years to put that structure in place.<\/p> <p>  In terms of increasing capacity, there are two elements.  There is the infrastructure in terms of bus fleet and rail fleet but also there is subvention to support those services.  Obviously we want to build that.

We have a long tradition in Dublin Bus and a very proud workforce.  I am very proud to be the CEO of Dublin Bus and I recognise that employees faced significant challenges over the past eight years.  We need to recognise that.  It is something of which we are proud in Dublin Bus and we will certainly do that.<\/p> <p>  Our fleet is funded by the NTA through capital investment.  We could not fund that through our current profit structure.  It was mentioned earlier that we have a reasonable profit which is in the order of &euro;1 million to &euro;3 million a year.  A double-deck vehicle costs approximately &euro;350,000 and, as such, one would not be able to fund a fleet out of that.  One of the key issues in terms of funding our fleet is that we need multi-annual funding to guarantee a steady flow of vehicles into the system.  The average age of a vehicle has been independently assessed from a customer point of view and a cost efficiency point of view at six years.  Currently, our fleet has an average age of approximately 7.5 years.  At current fleet requirements, that would require us to replace 85 vehicles a year.  Last year, we replaced in excess of that.  It was 110 vehicles.  However, in previous years the numbers fluctuated significantly.  Multi-annual funding would allow us to get a steady state of replacement of vehicles at the current levels of approximately 85 a year.  At &euro;350,000 per bus, the investment required would be of the order of approximately &euro;35 million.  It is a significant investment but it is worth it.  There are environmental benefits, customer experience benefits and reliability benefits.  I was asked if we were underfunded currently.  It is a yearly cycle whereby we receive funding and, currently, we are 1.5 years over the average fleet age.  That would equate to in excess of 100 buses to replace, but we advocate a steady 85 a year on the current fleet to get an even fleet replacement process and that requires multi-annual funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Coyne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>The Expressway market was set up under legislation in the late 2000s and since then there has been a vast oversupply in the market.

The deal hammered out allows for a 3% increase over and above the 8.25%, but the Minister has not opened the cheque book or increased State funding to provide for this.  How will it be provided for?  The deal speaks about a lean management scheme being implemented.  Will Mr. Coyne indicate how he sees this lean management scheme producing presumably what management would call savings?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Nolan of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  He indicated plans are under way regarding city services in Cork and Galway.  Will he be more specific about this?  Bus &Eacute;ireann has spoken of reduced terms and conditions for staff in a hived-off operation.  I am not seeking precise details but I am looking for something beyond a broad comment.  What is meant by reduced terms and conditions for those members of staff?  Will Mr. Coyne be more specific about this?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms Graham of the NTA.  The question relates to the franchising of the 10% orbital routes.  This is effectively privatisation because no one really expects Dublin Bus to win the competition the way it has been established.  How does the NTA expect private operators to be more competitive when more than two thirds of the costs of Dublin Bus relate to employee compensation, either wages or pensions, and most of the other 33% of costs covering material services are fixed?  Fuel accounts for almost half of it and it is fixed.  It is quite evident the only way in which one is more competitive in this environment is by reducing wages and conditions for staff.  What has happened to the promised triple-lock for CIE workers whereby there would be a transfer of undertakings?  There was a promise of a triple-lock in terms of the registered employment agreement, REA, a sectoral employment order and legislation.  This certainly has not been put in place.  What is the story?  Will new employees who are not transferred from CIE be on lower wages, poorer conditions and worse pensions?  Will they have collective bargaining rights?  Surely Ms Graham must accept this goes completely against the trend now in Europe, where the re-municipalisation of previously privatised transport services is taking place.  This is the case in Germany, France and the UK, where privatisation has delivered a poor service and high fares and services are not being re-nationalised..  If the company tries to operate these routes on the basis of lower wages and conditions and a race to the bottom, it is no way to run a modern transport system in a European capital and I ask Ms Graham for her comments on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#Q00300","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>We are in an extremely difficult position as I indicated.

We have put in additional frequency with the support of the NTA, which provided money as well.  We were able to put double-deck buses into services.  The reliability is not good in provincial cities because the priority measures are not there.  We need an advantage over cars in provincial cities.  Once one starts to grow public transport to make it attractive, one goes to vehicles such as BRT, which is a pre-tram system that operates in Belfast and which is being introduced in Dublin.  We need to plan for it in the provincial cities as well.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway is moving into a subsidiary and is not being hived off.

Where is the guarantee for a public transport service in that context?  I would have though the PSO levy was precisely to ensure that was the case.<\/p> <p>  In relation to Irish Rail, I am very pleased to hear that DART underground is still very much on the plans.  I know that the railway order was set aside last year, which was a huge disappointment.  The capital plan is coming next year.  Is Irish Rail almost ready at this point to vary what was originally in that railway order?  I presume it will be in time for the capital plan next year.  Will it vary by much?  One thing in which I am interested is the proposal to move the DART on to the Maynooth line.  What timeline is Irish Rail working to on that?  One issue for the whole west Dublin area on that particular rail line is that peak time capacity is very tight.  For example, I have been looking for additional rolling stock for this service, but there does not appear to be.  There is a demand for the service but the ability to deliver the service obviously is inhibited by the availability of rolling stock.  That would obviously lengthen the trains but as the platforms were extended some years ago, the length of the platform should not be an issue.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the NTA, we have heard about the growth in the use of public transport.  There also is an increase in the numbers commuting generally.  One would expect to see public transport improving as the economy improves.  How would the NTA measure success in terms of the modal shift?  Is that part of the remit of the NTA, given that additional services must be provided if new communities are developed?  I do not see where such amendments are made in any serious way.  In my own area, for example, there is a demand for but no bus service between Celbridge and Leixlip, two fairly big towns with good employment in Leixlip.  That has been requested for many years and would seem like an obvious demand that is not met.  How does one meet the demand for service?<\/p><p>Is that a negotiation between the National Transport Authority and organisations such as Dublin Bus?  Who makes the decision to do that?  There certainly is a public demand for it, but that demand has not been met.<\/p><p> Some &euro;2 million in profit was taken from the Dublin Bus balance sheet and transferred to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  How can fares be reduced?  Companies will continue to demand fare increases if there is no other option for bringing in revenue.

If the authority feels there is a public transport obligation regarding the provision of a service, we will respond and either provide a service by expanding the existing direct award contracts or we will tender out those services.  Last year we responded in respect of the changes made on the Expressway routes 5 and 7.  We provided additional services on Bus &Eacute;ireann's PSO direct award and we also tendered out additional services to meet the gaps that opened up as a result of the changes to the Expressway service.  We will respond wherever we are required to do so throughout the State if there are changes to commercial services leaving an area without a public transport service.<\/p> <p>  On the growth in public transport, obviously the economy is improving.  What would be the measure of success for the authority in terms of extra services?  The ultimate measure of success is having a modal shift, as has been set out in our strategy.  That is about ensuring car usage is reduced to 45% and that the sustainable mode use is up at around 55%.  To achieve that across the greater Dublin area would be quite a significant change.  That would be a measure of success.  However, many things need to be put in place before we would be close to achieving that, including all the rail infrastructure.  Improving the core bus network is a key priority for us in terms of the measures we can take to address the growing congestion now.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy said, commuting, including car commuting and public transport commuting, is generally increasing, leading to congestion which affects the bus services.  We are working on plans to upgrade the network of quality bus corridors in the Dublin region to try to ensure there is end-to-end priority for bus services on the key radial routes and on the orbital routes in order that we can respond to the congestion that is building on the commuter areas.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of reasonable profit, the investment in public transport is covered by both fare revenue and subvention.  We are obliged to ensure the public transport services that are delivered are covered either through fare revenue or through subvention.  We try to ensure there are no losses to the public transport operators, as we are obliged to do.  We are working with the operators to ensure that continues to be the case and also to try to meet the underfunding that certainly exists in Irish Rail services.  We believe that we should work on the capital investment in terms of bus and rail infrastructure.  The companies, themselves, will decide what they will do in terms of reinvesting profit.  We want to deliver the infrastructure in order that Dublin Bus and Irish Rail do not have to invest themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2016100500002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1475654400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>We share in the disappointment that DART underground was delayed.

I congratulate her.  The last time I sat opposite her, she was a manager in the south-central area in Dublin City Council.  She has done well; fair play to her.  She is probably more important than the Minister, because his response to nearly everything we asked him was that it was an operational matter.  I was nearly going to say \"an ecumenical matter\", a Fr. Ted Freudian slip.  The Minister referred everything back to the National Transport Authority.<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Graham to make a comment about subvention.  I worked in Dublin Bus.  I was a representative for the NBRU for years.  I met Mr. Ray Coyne as a local representative in the south-central area when the services were being rearranged and cut the last time.  It is extraordinary how Dublin puts up with one of the lowest rates of subvention for a capital city in Europe.  I ask Ms Graham to comment on that as somebody in charge of operational matters.  I refer to subvention for all companies and not just Dublin Bus.<\/p> <p>  I have a specific question on the Dublin Bus strike.  It is not about the outcome and will not affect the ballot.  Will the NTA fine Dublin Bus for the strike days lost?  If so, what is the point in that when the company is already struggling to survive?  Similarly, has it fined Luas and collected the fines for the strike days lost there?<\/p> <p>  I ask about extra licensing during the strike days.  On one of the Fridays when Dublin Bus was on strike, I observed dozens of private buses lined up on Eden Quay to go to Swords and Rush and other places on the north side.  They are not normally there on a Friday.  Did the NTA license extra buses or give the go-ahead for extra buses to be run by private operators anywhere during the Dublin Bus strike days?<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham was already asked about returning Dublin Bus profits.  I am delighted to hear that these profits, although returned to the NTA, then went to help the struggling Bus &Eacute;ireann.  However, I found Mr. Nolan&rsquo;s comments the most honest.  He spoke about Bus &Eacute;ireann scrambling through this commercial pressure of competition that is forcing it to reduce its labour costs etc. because of the much lower costs of the private operators.  Surely that really describes what is going in public transport.  It is the pressure from the private operators on struggling companies that have the lowest subvention in Europe.  Can we begin to look at that as an issue for public transport in this country?  Why are we issuing so many private company licences on the routes that are already covered by our national bus company, Bus &Eacute;ireann?<\/p> <p>  When speaking about the role of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Mr. Nolan said it provides the access to health care centres throughout Ireland.  This is a very important point.  Many of the people involved would have a free travel pass and would not have to pay.  Will the increased privatisation of routes impact on access to centres of excellence in Dublin, Waterford, Cork etc. for people with disability or old age passes and who have cancer or other ailments,?  That is an issue for the public in general.<\/p> <p>  Can Mr. Coyne explain why he thinks it is wise for Dublin Bus to use FirstCare to track sick leave for bus drivers?<\/p><p>I find it extraordinary that management does not play that role.  Given that the number of casual sick leave days was reduced from seven to four, why does Mr. Coyne now think there is a need to get somebody in England to ring the bus driver daily to ask how he or she is feeling?<\/p><p> To compliment Irish Rail, if what Ms Graham said is true, namely, that the NTA has exceeded its 2020 CO2 emissions reduction targets already, it is a case of hats off and well done.  That is a fantastic achievement and the NTA should be crowing about it.  I do not know what the position is - we could discuss the matter at the climate change committee - but it might be possible to make a special case for the NTA to get funding from Europe in order that it might put more money into Irish Rail to help achieve the similar outcomes to those already realised.  I would be very interested in seeing Irish Rail revert to considering perhaps the reopening of disused railway lines that go to Donegal and Kerry and from Waterford to Cork.  What a big difference that could make to travel in this country if we could invest in the reopening of the lines that already exist.  Irish Rail probably still owns much of the routes and land.  Perhaps Mr. Franks could comment on that.

Regarding the subvention and what the rates are compared to other European countries, it can be difficult sometimes to carry out such comparisons because it may not be possible to compare like with like.  The subvention is a public service obligation, PSO, subvention but there are other subventions that also go into public transport in Ireland, namely, the free travel and taxsaver schemes.  There is a tax loss associated with the taxsaver scheme, which also increases the State's subvention of public transport.  These elements, taken together, bring up the level of overall subvention.  Generally, however, it would still not really be comparable to other regions, particularly city regions, in Europe.  Therefore, we would like to see the level of subvention increased because it allows us to provide additional services and to consider our fares structure and see whether any improvements can be made to it in order to encourage more people to use public transport, which is what we are all about - increasing the amount of modal shift to public transport.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the strike, under the contract we have with Dublin Bus, it is set out what we do when services are not operated.
