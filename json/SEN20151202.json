In 2013 and 2014, we experienced particularly bad winters during which there were many storms and a great deal of damage was caused in the context of coastal erosion.  Counties Galway and Mayo were particularly hard hit in terms of the amount of damage done.  Senators will recall the scenes of roads being washed away that were shown on television.  A friend of mine who had no access to her home for weeks because the access road had been washed away had to have a new roadway constructed.  Many graveyards were damaged and fields were either damaged or washed away.  I know from contact with the local authorities concerned that they were under severe pressure at that time in terms of the amount of maintenance and other work they had to do.  There were some great projects undertaken in my own local area, including at Spiddal.  While the local authorities and their staff are to be commended on their efforts during that time and their ongoing work in this area, a great deal of work remains to be done in places such as the Aran Islands where, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware, roads were washed away or left impassable as a result of the damage caused by storms.<\/p> <p>Coastal erosion is not a phenomenon that is going to go away.  While 2013 and 2014 were unprecedented in terms of severe weather conditions, storms are occurring with greater frequency.  I know from research in this regard that similar phenomena occurred in 1974, 1983, 1989, 2004, 2008 and that the pattern is expected to continue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There will be rising sea levels and increasing frequency and intensity of storms.  There is a real threat to coastal infrastructure but in other countries they have longer-term monitoring programmes and they map changes on their coastlines to enable them to plan in advance.  It was strange that, in 2013-14, the Government did not seek funding from the EU for work on coastal erosion issues and to combat coastal erosion and potential storm damage.  A number of people felt that an attempt should have been made to access funding from the EU as it related to a natural disaster.  It was unprecedented and something over which people had no control.  Local authorities told us their hands were tied as regards resources and that these resources were limited, although the Government told them it was giving them the resources that were available.<\/p><p>It is frustrating that people who see roadways or infrastructure damaged close to their homes, but not on land owned by the local authority, get absolutely no support unless locals help them to repair damage.  I have been contacted recently by people around Tawin Island and Oranmore who asked me to raise this issue with the Minister as theirs is a low-lying area.  There has been severe coastal erosion in recent times and the foreshore is of a particularly delicate nature.  Oranmore is very close to the city so a large number of people live there and they are concerned that if other severe storms come their houses and lands will be in danger.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for coming in and I hope he can elucidate where we stand, particularly in counties Galway and Mayo and in Tawin and Oranmore in particular.  Can he say what is being done, what can be done and what will be done by the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#A00600","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to update the Seanad on the subject of coastal erosion.  I echo his comments on the courageous work carried out by local authority workers right around the country, including in Galway, during the very difficult storms and floods we experienced a number of years ago.<\/p> <p>Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process which takes place right around the entire coastline of Ireland.  Coastal erosion may threaten human life, land or infrastructure such as roads.  However, it must be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects such as providing natural nourishment and supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.  Due to the considerable extent and nature of the Irish coastline impacted by erosion and the fact that it is an ongoing natural process it would be uneconomical and impractical for the State to protect all of this coastline.  In the first instance, it is a matter for the local authorities to identify and prioritise areas of their respective coastlines considered to be under significant threat from erosion.  Any approach toward addressing problems of coastal erosion must be informed by an assessment of the risks involved.  In some cases a \"do nothing\" or \"no active intervention\" approach might well be the most appropriate management response and international studies have borne this out.  Some previous interventions to solve local erosion problems have exacerbated coastal erosion at other locations or have generated other environmental problems.  <\/p> <p>The OPW requires that proposals and funding applications for structural measures to prevent or mitigate coastal erosion should be done in conjunction with an appropriate coastal erosion risk management study which fully investigates, substantiates and demonstrates the merits of any measures being proposed.  Before we spend taxpayers' money on fixing a problem we need to check it is the right solution and does not have any accidental consequences.  Such measures usually require the investment of substantial amounts of public funds.  In order to ensure value for money, it is considered best practice to carry out a study in advance of undertaking any measures.  A study should include technical, economic, social and environmental criteria and should ensure that due consideration is given to the full range of management options.  The Irish coastal protection strategy study, ICPSS, has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline.  This study is available on the OPW website, where the exact risk to various parts of the coastline is shown.  The information is available to all local authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature as appropriate.<\/p> <p>I am informed that Galway County Council has carried out some works reinforcing bridges on Tawin Island.  Galway County Council was allocated funding of &euro;441,990 for works on the south shore of Inishbofin and &euro;90,000 for a study on Inishbofin as a whole in 2015, under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  Under this scheme applications are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Studies are also funded under this scheme so it is a direct way for the local authority to apply for minor flood mitigation and coastal protection scheme funding, up to &euro;500,000, if there is an area they need to examine to see if action can be taken.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for eligible projects from my office, subject to criteria, and any application which the council may make under the scheme will be considered by the OPW in accordance with the scheme's eligibility criteria.  No application for funding for works on Tawin Island was submitted by Galway County Council under this scheme but the option remains open to it.  The OPW has not received any application for funding under this scheme from Mayo County Council for 2015.<\/p> <p>Following the storms of December and January of 2013-14, the Government made funding available for the repair of specific public infrastructure and facilities damaged by the severe weather events.  The amount allocated to Mayo County Council by the Government for coastal repair and reinstatement works was &euro;4,205,000.  Galway County Council was allocated &euro;1,144,800.  Tawin Island was not included on the programme of works for coastal storm damage repair submitted by Galway County Council.  In recent weeks, however, I have been able to make an additional funding allocation in recognition of storms that occurred in February 2014 and under this funding allocation I provided a further &euro;6,000 to Mayo County Council.  Based on the very substantial works identified previously by Galway County Council, it will be allocated a further &euro;498,000.  I have given local authorities discretion in how they use the funding so they must pick the coastal repair or flood repair projects they think most appropriate.  It may be open to Galway County Council to consider Tawin Island under that, and it may submit an application to my office under the minor works scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#B00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his clarification.

The Minister of State said no works were applied for in Tawin Island.  Is there any particular reason for that?

It may also be possible to fund the work under the &euro;498,000 in additional funding to Galway County Council as the council has discretion over how to spend it.  I know it has many priorities and the western counties took quite a battering.  The minor flood mitigation and coastal protection scheme is not capped and councils can apply as often as they wish for projects of up to &euro;500,000, but it has to come out of my overall OPW budget.  There is not a limited pool of money in the scheme as it is demand led and we assess each application based on the criteria.<\/p> <p>I assume that Galway County Council will also be seeking funding in the context of coastal management and protection arising from the western CFRAM study.  We published draft maps last week and, should it highlight any coastal flood protection requirements, there may be an opportunity for further funding.  In light of the capital plan which we published recently we expect to spend, as a country, more money on flood mitigation measures and coastal protection in the next five years than we did in the past 20 years.  Given the issues arising from climate change it is right and proper that we do that.  It is a serious investment on behalf of the State and my office will continue to work with local authorities on this. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#B00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Measures","time":1449052200,"counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#B00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is the first time I have had the opportunity to address him since he took office, so I am glad the matter is a pressing one for the people of east Galway.  It is not a new issue either.  The Dunkellin river has flooded on a number of occasions in the past six years and these events have had a major impact on the local people, who live in constant fear for their homes and livelihoods.  Something needs to be done urgently to mitigate the threat of flooding in the area.  Local residents, businesses and farmers have a right not to live in constant fear that everything they hold dear might be washed away in the next flood.  All it takes for the river to burst its banks is a few inches of rainfall.  In the event of a torrential downpour, many locals are left completely helpless.<\/p><p>Initiatives aimed at relieving the pressure from potential flood risks have been raised over the years, well before the Minister of State or I ever got into politics, but nothing constructive was ever done to help the people living along the banks of the Dunkellin river and the Aggard stream.  I have witnessed such flooding during the course of my duties as a public representative and I can tell the Minister of State and his Department that they cannot act with enough haste on this issue.  We must consider introducing a scheme of works on the river, perhaps through community employment initiatives, to try to resolve the problem if funding is the issue.  If planning is the problem, we cannot engage enough with stakeholders and with those who might object to any works that could take place so that we can reach a solution to improve the lives of the families living along the river and give them the basic human right of safety in their homes.  It is fundamentally wrong that local residents in Craughwell and Kilcolgan and all along the Dunkellin river and Aggard stream should have to become so comfortable with using sandbags as a last means of protecting their properties and families.  To add insult to injury, the properties these people own are worthless as a consequence of this being allowed to happen so frequently.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister of State and his Department to take immediate action to implement some flooding relief measures that would be adequate to ensure that people along the Dunkellin river in County Galway no longer have to fear rainy days.  I know the Minister of State is trying to do what he can on this issue, but if he is mindful of dealing with the issue, could he try to implement adequate flood relief measures as soon as possible?  That would be most helpful.  It is heartbreaking to see a local resident in Craughwell on the front page of <i>The Connacht Tribune<\/i>drenched by the rain and his property surrounded by floods.  It is heartbreaking that this should be allowed happen and something needs to be done with haste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#C00100","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter, on which she has been working for quite a few years at this stage.  I hear, and share, her frustration that this is going on so long.  Only a few weeks after taking up this role, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of residents in the area and I know the grave difficulties they have experienced and their continual fear of future problems.  It is frustrating because, as far back as 2009 - in light of a flood event in November that year - a joint working group of representatives from the OPW and Galway County Council was established to examine flooding problems in the Galway area.  In addition, a study was commissioned by my office at that stage to identify additional practical measures that could be found to address flooding on the Dunkellin river and in its catchment area.  Consulting engineers produced a report identifying a flood relief for the area.  I accept and share the Senator's frustration that this has been going on for a very long time and I am very conscious of the damage and harm caused to people and their homes and businesses by severe flooding.<\/p> <p>The Office of Public Works is committed to addressing, in an effective way, all significant flood risk throughout the country and has agreed to fund a programme of flood alleviation works for the Dunkellin river from Craughwell to Kilcolgan and for the Aggard stream and its tributaries up to Cregaclare.  Galway County Council is the contracting authority with overall responsibility for the flood relief scheme.  The council appointed the engineering and environmental consultants needed to complete the design of the scheme and to attain the necessary statutory permissions for it.  Galway County Council is progressing the scheme through An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  A particular feature of the proposed scheme is that, having regard to its location, there are a number of environmental considerations associated with the proposed works which have had to be examined carefully and sensitively.<\/p> <p>Works proposed under the Dunkellin river and Aggard stream flood relief scheme can be divided into two distinct channels, namely, the Dunkellin or Craughwell river from upstream of Craughwell village to the N18 at Kilcolgan, and the Aggard stream and Monksfield river from Cregaclare, near Ardrahan, to its outfall at the confluence of the Dunkellin and Craughwell rivers.  Works on the Dunkellin river will consist of channel-deepening from Craughwell village to the confluence with the Aggard stream, local channel widening at Rinn Bridge and out-of-channel maintenance from downstream of Rahasane turlough, to Rinn Bridge.  The proposed works for the Aggard stream are minor in nature and will be limited to the replacement of field wall crossings and culverts which are blocked or undersized or which have collapsed, together with the removal of fallen trees and minor obstructions in the channel.  Maintenance works on the Aggard stream will include the non-invasive trimming of bank-side vegetation and the removal of areas of accumulated silt along the full length of the channel.  Galway County Council and their consultants finalised the environmental impact statement and Natura impact statement for the scheme in October 2014.<\/p> <p>The scheme was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for consideration in November 2014 for planning approval in line with section 175 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  A number of submissions from interested parties were received by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of the proposals and the board issued a request for further information to Galway County Council on 2 March 2015.  The council requested an extension of time in which to respond to the board's request and the period for response was extended to 10 July 2015.  In light of the significant additional data submitted by Galway County Council, An Bord Plean&aacute;la requested that both the statutory authorities that were advised of the planning application and the general public be made aware of the additional information and that further submissions or observations could be made to the board within a specific timeframe.  As Senator Higgins will be aware, an oral hearing on the proposed scheme commenced on Tuesday, 27 October 2015.  The hearing concluded on Tuesday, 3 November 2015 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has indicated that it would be making a decision on the application as expeditiously as possible.  I certainly hope that is the case.<\/p> <p>I fully acknowledge that bringing forward the proposals for the Dunkellin scheme has taken considerable time and that people affected by the flooding in the area are very anxious that works commence as soon as possible.  Galway County Council has been working as diligently as possible to advance the proposed scheme, while having regard to the environmental complexities and sensitivities involved.  We must wait for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to issue its determination on the proposals but, subject to this, I assure the Senator that the Government remains fully committed to the provision of a flood relief scheme for the Dunkellin river and Aggard stream.  We want to see this project under way as quickly as possible.  As soon as the board make a decision, and should that decision be favourable, we will get on with it as quickly as possible.  Crucially, in terms of funding, the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing the scheme in its multi-annual budget profiles into the future.  The funding is in place as is the commitment from Government, the council and the OPW.

We recognise the contribution that rural communities have made to overall national economic development and the development of local areas.  Our vision is of rural areas that are vibrant, inclusive and thriving economically .  People in rural communities should experience a quality of life that is at least as high, and probably better in several respects, as that experienced in urban areas.  The Government is committed to ensuring patients throughout the country continue to have access to GP services, especially in remote rural areas.  We will ensure general practice is sustainable in such areas into the future.<\/p> <p>The HSE, the Department of Health and Irish Medical Organisation are engaged in a comprehensive review of the general medical services and of other publicly-funded health sector GP contracts.  One of the issues encompassed by this review process is support for general practice, especially in remote rural areas.  While I do not propose to comment on the detail of the ongoing negotiations, I wish to depart from the prepared script by saying we are looking at the possibility of practice nurses being hired by the State so that GPs are no longer responsible for their recruitment.  I think this is one of the issues that will be discussed in the negotiations, even if it is not completed or agreed on.  Under the current general medical services contract, GPs who practise in remote rural areas of low population qualify for special rural practice concessions, including an annual allowance of just over &euro;16,200.  They also qualify for more favourable subsidies towards the employment of staff, including practice nurses and secretarial support.  More advantageous supports for locum costs for leave are also payable.<\/p> <p>The HSE has recently produced revised rural practice allowance guidelines for remote rural areas.  The purpose of the new guidelines is to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness when decisions are made about the relevant discretionary provisions of the general medical services contract as they apply to rural GP practices.  The guidelines also provide for a level of flexibility in considering applications from GPs which is greater than that provided for in the original governing circular.  The guidelines also provide additional options to support GPs.  From time to time, HSE local offices offer other incentives to attract GPs into rural areas, such as access to HSE facilities.  Additional contracts are also offered, such as contracts to provide medical officer services to nursing homes.<\/p> <p>I am aware that some isolated rural areas and deprived urban areas, often with limited private practice opportunities, may find it difficult to attract GPs to fill vacant posts.  However, I have been assured by the HSE that where a general medical services GP vacancy arises, it takes the necessary steps to ensure continuity of service to general medical services patients is maintained.  On 1 November last, there were just 20 general medical services lists out of a national total of more than 2,400 such lists without a permanent GP in place.  Eight of the 20 vacancies are in rural areas with populations of less than 1,500.  The full range of GP services continues to be provided to the patients concerned through a locum GP or a neighbouring GP.  A key objective of the engagement that is taking place with the Irish Medical Organisation at present is to achieve revised and modernised contractual arrangements which support the sustainable delivery of enhanced GP services in local communities.  These services constitute a key element of the range of public and privately provided services, including health and social services, that people need so that life in rural areas remains attractive and sustainable for them at all stages of their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#D00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive reply.

As we know from the work that was done on the contracts for those under the age of six and those over the age of 70, these matters have to be referred to the GPs and the medical community within primary care.  We have no control over that.  It is hoped that we will get it done as quickly as possible.  Much of the preliminary stuff was done during the negotiations on the contracts for the provision of GP services to those under the age of six and over the age of 70.

Such services are essential to support recovery and prevent disability for people with acquired brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis and a range of other neurological conditions.  Thousands of Irish people still cannot get the rehabilitation they need when they need it.  They face a lifetime of unnecessary disability, which can prevent them from returning to work and regaining their independence.  It is estimated that there are 25,000 patients in need of rehabilitation in Ireland.<\/p> <p>I have raised this issue because I am concerned about the deficits that exist in this area such as, for example, with regard to community teams.  Since the three-year national strategy was published and came into place, little or progress has been made to deliver on any of its recommendations.  For example, nine neuro-rehabilitation teams are needed in the community, but just three partially staffed teams are currently in place.  No new teams have been established since the strategy was published in 2011.  On the basis of the guidelines set by the British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine, our population means that 270 specialist inpatient beds are needed in this country.  We currently have less than half of that number.<\/p> <p>If we look at other rehabilitation services, we have a lack of longer-term rehabilitation supports, such as step-down units, transitional units and intensive home care packages, to allow people to go home after rehabilitation has come to an end.  This means they end up in totally unsuitable facilities.  For example, young people have to live in nursing homes, in acute hospital beds or in long-stay units with no ongoing rehabilitation.  It is important to remember that people with neurological conditions need intensive therapy within a window of recovery.  I know the Minister of State is aware of this.  Those who are waiting to get specialist rehabilitation lose vital recovery time every day of their waiting periods.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015 was published by the Department of Health and the HSE in December 2011.  A joint HSE and Department of Health working group was established in 2013 tasked with the development of an implementation plan.  Earlier this year, the HSE committed to releasing a draft implementation plan for consultation in December 2015.  I now understand this will not be released until 2016, which is why I have tabled this matter.  Separately, a model of care for specialist rehabilitation services is being developed by the national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine.  The draft of this model of care is being reviewed by the HSE following its submission in September 2015 and no date is available for its publication.  Without the publication of the implementation plan for a neuro-rehabilitation strategy no money is being invested, no services are being put in place and thousands of people are not getting the rehabilitation they need.  Yesterday, Mags Rogers of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland spoke about condemning people to live with an unnecessary disability.  We are speaking about the vital window of recovery.  As I have tracked this issue it has been a catalogue of delays, U-turns and no implementation plan.  I have met many people in recent years whose quality of life would have been greatly improved if we could have intervened earlier.  We have a strategy.  Why do we not have a plan and why are we not implementing it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#D00700","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>We had difficulty at the outset, which I encountered very quickly, apart from having no money which was the biggest difficulty of all, as there was a difference of opinion as to how it should be delivered.  It is very difficult to say to one specialist that what he or she is saying is wrong and say to another specialist that he or she is right.  There was a clear difference of opinion as to how it would be delivered.  This is why the implementation plan and the national clinical programme are so important.<\/p> <p>The report, National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011&ndash;2015, made a number of recommendations for services for people with rehabilitation needs, including clinical, therapeutic, social, vocational and community supports.  Following the development of the report, the Health Service Executive established the rehabilitation medicine clinical programme. The scope of the programme covers the whole of the patient's journey from self-management and prevention through to primary, secondary and tertiary care.  This provides a national strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  The programme includes the standardisation of access to and delivery of high-quality, safe and efficient hospital services nationally as well as improved linkages with primary care services.  This is where the dispute arose with regard to whether it was better to do it within the community or whether it should be attached to an acute hospital.<\/p> <p>The rehabilitation medicine clinical programme is nearing completion of a model of care for the provision of specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland, which will be the basis for the delivery of the service.  The HSE disability services division has a role in certain key aspects of neuro-rehabilitation services, primarily the provision of community-based therapy services and personal social services.  The disability services division will use the recommendations of the value for money and policy review of disability services to focus on disability funded rehabilitation services and enable reconfiguration of existing provisions through the establishment of demonstration sites.  Close links will be maintained with the rehabilitation medicine clinical programme to ensure there is no duplication of effort and that all initiatives receive optimal support.  Demonstration sites have been identified by disability services and mapping has commenced.<\/p> <p>Having regard to the foregoing details, it is not accurate to say that no element has been delivered.  A national steering group, chaired by the Health Service Executive social care division, has been assigned the task of developing an implementation framework for the national policy and strategy for neuro-rehabilitation services.  The steering group includes representation from the national clinical programmes for rehabilitation medicine and neurology, the Department of Health, primary care, therapy professions and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  Once the implementation framework has been agreed by the steering group, it will then go for consultation to the wider stakeholder interest groups.  Following consultation, the framework will be revised and will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level.  The HSE is very aware of the needs of people with neurological conditions - how could it not be - and will continue to work towards improved services, making best use of available resources.<\/p> <p>The disability sector is now connecting, and yesterday I met Enable Ireland which could play a very big part, and we all know the other non-governmental agencies with a particular interest in this area.  The new hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is on its way and it will provide not only outreach therapies but additional beds.  It should have been done ten years ago, and the Senator and I know this, but with regard to thrombolysis, while prevention in accident and emergency department has played a significant role, much more needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#E00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister of State.

I put Members on notice that I have tabled a number of significant amendments regarding pensions.  These amendments would ensure that what happened in the case of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, whereby a Government cut promised benefits by up to 60%, is not allowed to happen to any other worker in the State.  I ask Members from the Government side and from the Opposition to have a look at those amendments in advance of the debate.

This would not give Members sufficient time to reflect on the Minister's presentation or other Second Stage contributions before tabling amendments to this important piece of legislation.  I suggest that Second Stage of the Bill be moved to tomorrow, Thursday, 3 December, and that Committee Stage be taken on Monday 7 December.  This would allow Members sufficient time to table amendments on Friday.

Because it is a money Bill it could not be moved in this House and it was moved in the D&aacute;il.  This Bill would have given some relief to people who are paying management fees.  There are 200,000 households - apartments and houses - paying both full local property tax and management fees.  Many of these people are paying the local property tax for services they do not receive from the local authority.  The report of the expert group chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill recognised this issue.  I proposed a modest change that would give up to &euro;300 relief, or a third of the local property tax, whichever was lower, to take into account the fact that these 200,000 households are effectively paying on the double - full local property tax and full management fees.  This measure would only be for principal private residences and only for those whose management fees were paid fully to date.  The full cost of the measure would be &euro;15 million.  This Bill was moved in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Sean Fleming but unfortunately was defeated by the Government.  In advance of the Finance Bill Members can only table recommendations, and I will be putting forward a recommendation.  I ask the Leader, in advance of Second Stage tomorrow, to inform the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, that we intend to move this again.  This is in the interests of fairness, and I believe most would agree that people should not have to pay for services they do not receive.  An element of common services can be paid for, but this is an issue of fairness in regard to how the local property tax is actually levied on properties.  I intend to table a recommendation on this matter on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  In advance of that I ask the good office of the Leader to raise it with the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p>I am formally proposing the amendment that No. 6 not be taken today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#H00100","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I am sure the Leader will respond to Senator O'Brien's comments about the International Protection Bill 2015, but I remind colleagues that Members received an e-mail from the Bills Office on 27 November informing us that the deadline for submitting amendments to the International Protection Bill 2015 was one hour after the conclusion of Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#H00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>With respect to Senator Bacik, that means they must be prepared in advance of the Second Stage speeches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#H00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>That was in anticipation of the conclusion of the Bill last night, so we will wait.

I know that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, has made a welcome commitment on behalf of the Labour Party that we will seek to end the baptism barrier for school entry and to double the number of multi-denominational schools. Some of the ground work has been done by the current Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in establishing the national Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector.

Two cases stood out.  One was in 1968, the year I was born.  A child aged 12 who was a rape victim had a child in the home.  That woman would now be 57.  In 1982 there was a birth mother who was 14 years of age.  I was 14 in 1982.  She would now be 47.  Her record states &quot;Premature, 33 weeks, gasped and died.&quot;  I want to know if these cases were reported to the Garda.  Did the home, or the predecessor of Tusla, report these cases?  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>put a series of questions to the Sisters of the Sacred Heart and to Tusla regarding the reporting of these cases and they declined to answer.  They said they would deal directly with the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.  The reality, as we know, is that the commission cannot use any of the documentation or information in relation to criminal proceedings.  Rape is a crime.  I want to know whether these cases have been reported and what is actually happening.  These women are still alive today, and I do not trust what has happened in these homes.  The reports and figures uncovered by Mr. Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta show us why it is vital to have an audit.  The State has a responsibility.  These were children who were raped.  What are we doing for them now?  We can talk about times being different then, but one of the cases I mentioned was in 1982, which was not such a different time.  What are we doing now with the full knowledge that we have? Are we ensuring that they will at last get justice? These women, very likely still alive today, were mistreated horrendously by the State.

He proposed that not only should Ireland not increase its herds, but we should get rid of all of our animals and plant forests over the entire country.  He wants to revert to a pre-Ice Age state.  What will he do with the 275,000 people who are employed in agriculture, be it as farmers or direct employees?  That represents 10% of total employment.  Some 12.3% of total exports, amounting to &euro;10 billion, come from the agricultural trade.  Is An Taisce proposing that farmers and employees should be given chainsaws and pruners and told to look after all of the trees that we will sow?  That is ludicrous.  Anyone in receipt of State funding should be responsible in what he or she says on the nation's airwaves.  All of the media has a responsibility to ensure that both sides of an argument are put forward.  Planting the entire country under trees was a crazy suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I second the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, as well as the amendment proposed by Senator Barrett, if I am permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett's amendment is the main topic that I wish to discuss.  He touched on my concern, in that the legislation is one of the most convoluted and difficult Bills that I have ever seen.  When I spoke on Second Stage some time ago, on principle I addressed what the Bill tried to achieve and so on, but the Minister, for whom I have great respect at a personal level, has tabled five amendments to the same part of the Bill.  As originally drafted by Deputy Shatter, the Bill was to be a lion in tackling the difficulties with the legal profession, dragging it kicking and screaming from the pre-Victorian era of the 19th century into the 21st century through reforms, but we have ended up with a little lamb.  The lion is gone, leaving a convoluted Bill.<\/p> <p>Two weeks ago on Committee Stage, the Seanad agreed a raft of amendments - no one called a vote - tabled by the Government to its own Bill.  Last night, I called votes because we were asked several times to agree to amend or delete the amendments that the Minister introduced two weeks ago.  How can we have faith and trust in this legislation?  It is supposed to be one of the most reforming Bills that has ever been laid before the House.  As spokesman on justice, I rarely make such a strong point, but before we make a major blunder with this legislation, I ask in support of Senator Barrett that the Minister withdraw and reconstitute it so that we might know which amendments we are debating.  Last night, we had a large list of amendments that was a book in itself, but we also had a supplementary list of amendments to those amendments.  Once the Bill is amended, it must return to the D&aacute;il.  Last night was like a maze, with people wondering what page to read and to what amendments or deletions the Minister was referring, yet reasonable amendments from Senator Barrett, Sinn F&eacute;in and others were brushed aside as irrelevant.<\/p> <p>The legislation is intricate and difficult, but before we make a major mistake in rushing it through, the Minister should stand back and get her act together on Report Stage.  One day would suffice to get everything ready.  There would be more co-operation from this side.  As matters stand, I find it difficult to support amendments on Report Stage that delete amendments to which I agreed two weeks ago.  It is like the three-hand trick - is it this, that or the other?  I am confused about where we are going and I believe that the Minister is as well.<\/p> <p>The drafting of this Bill leaves a lot to be desired.  It has been four years in the ether.  This is an important issue even though I know that the Cathaoirleach is anxious for me to sit down.  This Bill commenced four years ago and everything is being rushed through now because we are coming closer to the recess and the Government wants it enacted before the next election.  If it is enacted in a rushed fashion, it will do major damage to the Seanad.  I have respect for this House, but what happened last night and is about to happen today is not good for legislation or democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J00500","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>On a point of clarification, my understanding is that Senator Barrett moved an amendment to the Order of Business so that No. 16 would be taken before No. 1 and that he is opposing the Order of Business because it includes No. 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>He can table an amendment as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J00800","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>If there is any confusion, I propose a separate amendment that we-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J00900","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Could we get clarification from Senator Barrett, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01000","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I am opposed to taking No. 2 today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01100","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>He is opposed and is moving an amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett has already proposed an amendment so that No. 16 would be taken before No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>He is also opposing the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>In which case, Senator O'Donovan must propose an amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01500","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the effect that the Legal Services Regulation Bill be withdrawn and resubmitted in a more acceptable fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01700","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>That No. 2 be deleted from the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01800","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Separate from the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#J01900","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I welcome yesterday's announcement that we will have new bankruptcy legislation enacted before Christmas.  It will reduce the period of bankruptcy from three years to one year for new applicants, and to 18 months for those who are already in the system.  There are good reasons for the introduction of this legislation.  For starters, it will provide equality between the North and South of Ireland.  It will end the bankruptcy tourism that we have seen whereby some people who have the means to declare themselves bankrupt in Northern Ireland or Britain did so to avail of the shorter period of bankruptcy there.  I also think, however, that people who are forced into bankruptcy have suffered enough.  A one-year period is more than enough.  More importantly, it will encourage lenders to behave more reasonably when they are being offered settlements by people who find themselves in difficulties.  I also welcome the fact that there will be bona fide requirements in the legislation - in other words, a carrot and stick approach - so that people who hide their assets from the official assignee will have their period of bankruptcy increased to 15 years from eight years.<\/p> <p>The mortgage arrears crisis is far from over, as we all know.  This legislation will improve the situation for those who suffer, as well as forcing banks to come to the table, which will bring this dreadful period of our history to a faster conclusion.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate, whenever possible, on the continuing mortgage arrears situation in this country and the various facets relating to it, such as the mortgage-to-rent scheme, which has not been embraced by the financial institutions, and a number of other measures such as debt to shared equity.  We need to have a wider discussion on such matters.<\/p> <p>I wish to congratulate my colleague Deputy Willie Penrose, who initiated this legislation by way of a Private Members' Bill last March.

I think they missed the real story.  We spent six hours here dealing with 25 pages of amendments.  We went from six o'clock until midnight.  I commend the Leader of the House, Senator Maurice Cummins, because he stood up for parliamentary discipline.  Despite the intentions and wishes of the Minister, which were made very clear indeed, either to guillotine it or continue on until four or five in the morning, Senator Cummins remanded the Seanad at midnight, and quite right too.  Well done to the Leader.  We had 23 pages of amendments to one page of the Bill.  We had amendments to amendments that were made last week.  It was bizarre.  I have never, in my entire time in the House - nearly 30 years - seen anything remotely comparable.<\/p> <p>I suggested that because of this concentration of amendments on page 41, the logical thing would have been to reprint page 41 in full.  I also suggested that we should reprint the Bill with the Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill had already been amended, but we were not given an amended Bill to work off.  We were therefore working off five documents at the same time, including lists of grouped amendments, Committee Stage amendments, Report Stage amendments and the Bill itself.  It was an absolute nightmare and there was great dissatisfaction on all sides of the House.<\/p> <p>Serious issues were raised.  I raised the question of the total absence of a definition of \"monitor\", which was a significant area.  The Bill defines what a CEO is.  Everybody knows what a CEO is, but nobody defined the responsibilities, duties and functions of the monitor.  It was just left there as a new word.<\/p> <p>I would like to second both Senator O'Donovan's amendment that this Bill be withdrawn and Senator Barrett's amendment that we take item No. 16 first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#K00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett's amendment has already been seconded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#K00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Okay.

It sought to exempt people who reach the age of 65 after next January and who qualify for jobseeker's allowance or benefit from the requirement to be available for and genuinely to seek full-time employment.  The existence of the State pension is historical.  Until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for the contributory State pension was 70 years of age.  State pension transition, known then as the retirement pension, was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65 years of age.  The qualifying age for the contributory State pension was subsequently increased over time to 66 years which left State pensions effective for just one year.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that the State pension age would increase gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2015 with the abolition of the availability of the State pension at 65 thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p> <p>Mandatory retirement clauses which force people to retire at 65 coupled with the abolition of the State pension transition mean that people in this position do not qualify for a pension until 66 and therefore must sign on for a jobseeker's payment.  We suggest that this is a ridiculous situation.  After years of employment, people will be forced to endure a gap year before the State steps in with a pension entitlement.  They will be considered too old to work by their previous employers but too young to claim a pension from the State.  The failure to address this issue is just another example of how poorly the Government treats older people.  There is no justification for it whatsoever.  Despite claims to the contrary, older people have not been protected by the Government.  We oppose strongly the continuous attacks on the elderly which the Government has pursued since taking office.  I will not go into all the details as I did on Second Stage, but the argument is that there is a need to look at this in light of what we are saying and the practicalities of forcing people to retire at 65 who then have a gap year before the State will step in.  I would be grateful for the observations of the Minister of State in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#P01600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I will not cause a row with him, but I do not accept that the Government has attacked older people.  One need only look at the recent budget and the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill under discussion having regard to some of the cuts introduced by this and the previous Administration such as the Christmas bonus, 75% of which has now been re-established.  We could have a long discussion about what happened prior to and after 2011, but Senator Mooney knows well the situation in relation to the demographics of the country and where we are going.  The likelihood is that someone born this year will be of pensionable age for a far longer period than that for which his or her working life contributions will provide.  Our legislation and pensions will have to reflect that.  We have seen in legislation the slow rise towards 67 of the pension age over the last term.  My access to retirement benefit will be 67 as I am a bit younger than the Senator.  There are supports from age 65.  There is job benefit, which applies for nine months.  There is no mandatory retirement age as the Senator outlined.  In a lot of private sector jobs, people continue to work far beyond the age of 65.  The point the Senator made about keeping this under continuous review is well made.  All these elements should be kept under review, not just in relation to pensions and retirement age but also in relation to social welfare legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#P01700","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>A Galway family has brought this issue to my attention.

The family has made a valid point to me which is that there was insufficient notice for people as old as 59 or 60 to plan for their retirement when the pension age was moved to 67.  They are retiring at 65.  Will the Minister of State clarify for the House the supports that apply from 65 to 67?  I heard him refer to jobseeker's allowance, but it is not in the nature of these people to apply for that benefit.  Can the Minister of State explain the qualifications for the transition pension?  Is that from 65 to 66 years or 66 to 67?  I have some concern.  We made a mistake in government on that side when I was there.  I voted for it, but we should not have introduced measures to move the age to 67 for people that were over 50 or 55 years of age.  Now, they are in trouble.  As this man and his wife said to me, they will lose at least &euro;40,000 if they live to the average life expectancy.

On a voluntary basis, they can opt to avail of training, community employment courses and further education.  We need to improve things.  One can see from how the demographics of the population are changing that we must look at the whole range of life.  A child born this year will work late into their 70s and he or she will want to contribute to society.  Therefore, we must ensure that legislation reflects changing demographics.  People who live a healthy life and wish to contribute to society should be able to do so.

We flagged the issue several times in the Seanad and the T&aacute;naiste responded so that aspect has been addressed.<\/p> <p>The next move on the pension age will be in the year 2021 and it will be dealt with by the next government.  As has been said, we must deal with the matter in terms of companies.  Workers were contracted long before moves were made on the pension age, which means that many people in Liebherr in Killarney, for example, and in other places must retire on reaching 65 years of age.  Home helps must retire at the age of 65 but some of them do not want to do so.  Therefore, we must change employment law.  I have no doubt that we will bring forward legislation to move the retirement age to 67 years in order to cover the year long gap that people must endure.  Between now and 2021, some people could have a two year lead-in to their pension.  I do not know if the government of the day will decide to create a two year jobseeker's benefit for them.

I put forward the following view to the Minister of State.  On the one hand, the Government has talked about extending the age of eligibility for the contributory and non-contributory old age pensions while, on the other, the Government's policy over the past five years has made it less attractive for younger workers to take out pension plans.  I cannot see how the Government can square the circle in this regard.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has said that jobseeker's allowance will be provided.  I fully agree with him that there should not be a mandatory age of retirement.  The Minister of State and Senator Moloney are right in terms of the private sector.  In the public sector and semi-State bodies, once a person reaches 65 years he or she must retire regardless of how much expertise he or she possesses.  There has been an exodus of senior personnel in their late 50s from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which means expertise has been lost.  I am sure there are many other professions that I could mention.  There is something inherently wrong in this trend that has developed over the years.  I applaud the Government when it takes initiatives along these lines but this issue seems to have fallen through the cracks.  Perhaps that is due to addressing other pressures such as fire brigade issues, allowances and dealing with various sectors of the community.<\/p> <p>The pension timebomb is very real, and I will score a political point by saying the following.  Charlie McCreevy, although criticised, should be complimented on introducing the National Pensions Reserve Fund, admittedly at a time when the economy was expanding.  It was a brilliant initiative because it recognised, even in the early 2000s, that by 2025, 2030 or 2040 there would be a very real problem, for whatever government, in addressing public service pensions as public servants pay less, apart altogether from the private sector.<\/p> <p>I do not expect the Minister of State to wave a magic wand to deal with the issue but I want to put the following on the record.  I believe that it has been folly in light of the pension timebomb, and I would say the same if a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration had done so, to penalise younger workers who want to take out pension plans.  The Government should encourage them to do so by having lower and less penal tax rates, thus making it more attractive for people to take out pensions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I remember being advised to take out a pension plan when I was in my 20s or 30s but I did not do it until much later.  On a personal level, I hope the Minister of State is back in Government but whatever time is left to him as a Minister I hope the issue of encouraging more young workers to take out private pension plans is looked at in the broadest sense.  Otherwise we will go bankrupt.  He gave us the figures on demographics and everything else and it is a pity that people who want to continue working are forced, under a mandatory company policy or something else, to retire.  Not all people find themselves in a financially straitened situation because of one year and there is a safety net but there seems to be an imbalance.  If we are going to extend eligibility, year by year, over the next decade we should put mechanisms in place on the other side of the equation to address the pensions timebomb.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#Q03100","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I will be brief because I have specific amendments regarding pensions, which I will table later.  This section deals with changes in the normal retirement age and I ask the Minister of State to consider airline pilots and others in non-public sector jobs who have to retire at 55.  They now cannot access their pension, or any State benefits, until the age of 67.  This is something that cannot be fixed in this Bill.  I give pilots as an example because they are not allowed to continue flying for medical reasons but there are others and in the public sector we have the same situation with garda&iacute;.  At some stage we will need to grapple with compulsory retirement ages.  As Senator Mooney said, many people want to continue working so why do we make it impossible for them to do so?  A late retirement option can be applied for through Revenue but that is on an individual case basis.<\/p> <p>The overall pension provision is very worrying and most people will not realise that the pension liability coming down the track to us is multiples of what the banking liability was to the State.  It will be a problem that will become far more apparent to people from 2030 onwards and it affects both private and public pension provision.  I told the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection that never had so much been done to undermine the security of pensions and pension provision than has been done by the changes in pension regulations in the past couple of years, in particular the private pension levy whereby the pension pot was dipped into for some &euro;2.4 billion.  As a result of other changes in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013, employers can extricate themselves from promises they made to employees.<\/p> <p>I produced a paper in 2009 which I sent to the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, and which I also sent to the current Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, at the start of this Oireachtas term.  It was on the subject of how we would actually fund public sector pensions.  In the future, it will not be acceptable for public sector pensions to be paid out of current Government expenditure.  At some stage we will have to set up a hybrid arrangement whereby new entrants' increments to existing public sector pensions go into a separate pension fund.  Some investments will come back from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which was rightly used in our crisis situation, but we have to look at doing it again by starting a separate fund.  I am not talking about changing existing benefits in the public sector and, as far as I am concerned, what one has one holds, but for those joining in the future we should move towards a hybrid arrangement with a mix of defined benefit and defined contribution so that the State will at least have an idea of what its liability will be and can meet it into the future.  It is not for this Bill right now but it is something all parties need to have a serious think about in the run-up to the general election and whatever the make-up of the next Government, it will need to prioritise pensions.  We are proposing that there be a pensions Minister, even if it is at a junior level, to encourage a complete focus on the issue.  <\/p> <p>I will talk about the merging of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman later on.  People who have to retire because of their employment are not dealt with in this Bill and we should look at including them in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#R00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I joined a semi-State company at 20 and it was compulsory to pay approximately 6.9% or 7% of my wages towards my pension.

It is a small social welfare Bill and we are debating pensions, which I welcome.  No political party has the answer on this and it will take some time to consider what is best for the State.  We should certainly be building up a reserve.  I sat on a finance committee on Dublin City Council and we met with the Department of Finance.  At the time, Dublin City Council was doing reasonably well and we wanted to make provision for pensions within the city council so that it would not come out of current revenue but we were barred from doing it.  I am not political point-scoring as this is an issue that will hit this country like a tsunami and we have to start planning for it now.<\/p> <p>Senator Brennan asked about compulsory enrolment.  In England, one has to actually opt out of a pension to avoid automatic enrolment.  Many of these issues have to be debated.  A young couple in their late 20s or early 30s have a different set of priorities, such as buying a home, and this is something that will impact on them in 30 or 35 years' time.  They say they want to buy the house now and will worry about their pension in 35 years' time.  The State will have significant financial challenges and I agree with Senator Mooney that one of the good things Charlie McCreevy did was to set up the reserve fund.  It was a good example of forward planning.  As things are slowly getting better and the recovery is kicking in, now is the time to have the discussion but we should not be putting up party flags and having major disagreements over the issues.  We want a good pension scheme that will provide for the citizens of this country for the next 30, 40 or 50 years and we need to plan for it now.  Having a discussion on it now is healthy but it needs to be discussed as a full pension debate, rather than under a social welfare Bill.  I would be interested in listening to the contributions to that debate.  Much work has been done by the Department of Social Protection to prepare us for the discussion.  I believe automatic enrolment in a pension scheme for people joining a workforce will play a key role and we will have to look at how we provide for the pensions, in 30 or 40 years' time, of new recruits into the public sector.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Hayden raised some points regarding age discrimination and enforced retirement at particular ages.  All that needs to be considered.  Previously, regulations were made for garda&iacute;, fire-fighters, airline pilots and so on - we can go through the list - to retire at certain ages.  At that stage life expectancy was far shorter.  I remember when my father retired.  At that time, life expectancy was in the early 70s for men and was only tipping towards the late 70s for women.  Now, men are expected to live well into their 80s and, as time passes, they will be living into their 90s.  If current expectation for retirement continues, the likelihood is that we will spend longer retired than contributing to the workforce.  All that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>There is a great role for that debate to take place in this House or in committee in a non-party fashion.  Everyone is interested in getting the best solution.  When we talk about pensions, we are talking about is long-term planning.  Part of the discussion relates to building up the pensions reserve fund again and discussing where it should be invested.  It should be invested in Ireland in the State sector but there are regulations relating to pension funds and where they can be invested.  I am keen to see a wide debate on pensions.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for raising this important issue in the context of the section.

That was her justification for raising it, as if it were as simple as that.  We know and the Minister of State knows that we have a major problem with underemployment.  We have a problem with many low-paid workers, particularly women.  Many are low-paid workers in the retail sector and other sectors.  They want to work more hours but cannot get the hours and are not in a position to get them.  It is not fair to say that many lone parents are going to be better off because of these changes.  That is simply not the case.  Certainly, they can speak for themselves and they have been clear advocates for their circumstances in recent years.<\/p> <p>What we were trying to do with the amendment was reverse the changes.  Unfortunately, the amendment was ruled out of order.  In any event, I was keen to raise the point again.<\/p> <p>Like Senator Mooney and other Senators, I support the thrust of the Bill.  It does not go far enough from our perspective but it does give something back to people on social welfare that was taken from them in recent budgets.  One of the cuts which was most unfair was the change to the lone-parent family payment.  We are being told we have a recovering economy.  Figures out today suggest there is plenty of money about the place.  The Taoiseach's comments in the D&aacute;il also indicate this to be the case.  If there is loads of money about the place, why are we not reversing these changes?  When we put questions to the T&aacute;naiste on this issue, we were told it would cost approximately &euro;21.7 million to fully reverse it.  Like many things, that should be considered by Government.  I was keen to raise the point again under the section, although the amendment was ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#S02100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I will try to be brief.

It is important to highlight that as a result of this, no lone parent with a youngest child aged under 14 years is required to take up employment to receive income support from the Department.  The T&aacute;naiste made that change.  Moreover, the back-to-work family dividend has been most successful.  A substantial number of the people who have taken up the back-to-work family dividend are lone parents.  They have been able to increase their hours and gain from that.  Let us consider the statistics.  This will be seen in future as a progressive move to assist lone parents back to the workforce and proper employment.

It is about whether women can work and whether they have the opportunity to work.  The Minister of State must realise that many parents have two, three or more children and it may be difficult for them to get a part-time job.  Many of them want to work and do work.  Those not in a position to work because work is not available or because they cannot get sufficient hours are being penalised.  No one wants to see people dependent on social welfare, least of all, the people who are dependent on social welfare themselves.  There will always be a tiny minority in any state or population who might depend on welfare.  However, the Minister of State will agree that is only a small percentage of people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator David Cullinane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reality is there are many lone parents who either want to work or are not in a position to work because of their circumstances and who have been penalised and are worse off because of the changes.  They have suffered more hardship because of changes that were made.  If one listens to lone parents and their advocate groups, that is what they are telling us.  That is what they are telling the Minister of State.  They do not have a difficulty with being able to work.  They want to work.  Many of them will, if they can get more hours if they can go back to work.  When we debated this with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection in 2012 when she first mooted this in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, she was clear and unequivocal that none of this would happen until we had proper so-called Scandinavian child care.  That never materialised.   That is why many of these women feel betrayed.  With the absence of supports, it is not even financially viable for them to work.  Many of them, as I said, are in low-paid jobs.  Many of them go to work anyway, even though there may not be any significant financial reward for them.  They still get up and go to work and do all of these things, but they struggle in low-paid jobs with the cost of child care.  These are the ones about whom I would be concerned.<\/p><p>I am not supportive of those who see themselves as dependent on social welfare, but that is not how the majority of lone parents see themselves.

We can argue the toss on this issue.

This is very important.<\/p> <p>I do not want people to forget what is involved here.  The telephone allowance, for example, was worth nearly &euro;29 a month, in effect.  It was reduced to &euro;9 during the term of this Government before being abolished entirely.  It is a matter of grave concern.  I am sure it is raised with the Minister of State, particularly by elderly people, when he is out and about in his own constituency.  The abolition of this allowance raised various issues with regard to alarms, etc.  That is just one example.<\/p> <p>At the very least, we should review the impact on stakeholders of the various cuts, including the cuts in the electricity, gas and household package.  I suggest that the abolition of the telephone allowance, in particular, is one of the biggest mistakes made in this area.  Amendment No. 6 calls for a report to be prepared within four months of the passing of this Act \"reviewing all expenditure reductions or ceasing of payments in relation to the treatment benefits package since 2011, and setting out options for restoring those payments to their previous levels\".  I think these amendments should be accepted by this Government or any future Government on the basis of a specific commitment to look at how these benefits can be restored to previous levels.<\/p> <p>The abolition of bereavement grant payments was one of the most bizarre cuts imposed by this Government.  When it was going after the elderly, it decided to go after them after they have died as well.  Amendment No. 7 proposes to review this atrocious cut by calling on the Government to look at \"options for restoring those payments to their previous levels\".  I am talking about options.  When the T&aacute;naiste came in here to debate the abolition of the bereavement grant, she gave all types of reasons for it.  She suggested that undertakers were increasing fees, for example.  It was all the usual nonsense we hear from time to time.  There has been nothing to back that up.<\/p> <p>If the Government commits to a proper review of the particular cuts that are mentioned in amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, at least we will know whether I was talking rubbish, or the T&aacute;naiste was talking rubbish, at the time of their abolition.  I might be proven wrong after four months, or the Government might have to face the option of accepting it was wrong to cut the telephone allowance.  I know from meeting elderly people and others in north County Dublin that its abolition has had an impact on our senior citizens, in particular.  The bereavement grant was seen as very important for people with no income who were not able to make the necessary provisions.  Many elderly people are concerned about how they and their families will be able to afford to bury them.  It was right that the State made some contribution towards these costs in the past, and it is wrong that this Government has abolished the grant.  That is what these amendments seek to address.  That is my view.  I am seconding all three amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#U00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept these amendments.

The purpose of the new section and these amendments is clear given what has happened with some pension schemes already when we relaxed the funding requirement for employers and pension scheme trustees.  In effect, these amendments would remove the single insolvency introduced by the Government.  We can understand why a pension scheme might have to be wound down if the company and the scheme were insolvent.  We have the example of the IAS scheme where a profitable employer with hundreds of millions of euro in cash reserves ran down its pension scheme and doubled its deficit from &euro;350 million to &euro;760 million in two years by starving the scheme of funds.  The employer told existing scheme members not to contribute to the scheme and doubled the deficit.  The Government introduced legislation under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act and the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act that actually showed a roadmap to Aer Lingus, the DAA and former SRT as to how they could back slide their way out of the commitments they had given to the detriment, in particular, of long-standing deferred members who had not drawn down their pensions.  People lost up to 60% of their promised benefits, retired members lost at least six weeks pay and active members have been put into an inferior pensions scheme.  That legislation allowed members of a pension scheme to be unilaterally moved out of a scheme without their permission.  That never happened before.  The single insolvency is a retrograde step.  It was a mistake and it should be fixed.  My amendment No. 11 seeks that a solvent firm should not be allowed to close a defined benefit pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90% funding standard.  That is what it should be and that is what it is in many other developed countries across the world and in most European countries.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 13 is specific to the IAS scheme and would reverse the scheme brought forward by the Government.  It states that the IAS scheme shall not be allowed to close its pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90% funding standard.Amendment No. 14 seeks that the IAS scheme shall not be allowed to close its pension scheme except where all pension scheme members are treated in an equitable manner on the winding up of that scheme.  Those amendments are clear. <\/p><p>I would like to quote some figures from Lane Clark and Peacock's pension account and briefing of 2015 which are particularly interesting.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As most people know, equity markets in managed funds have been the subject of substantial growth in the past two years.  However, Senators might be surprised to learn that the deficit in the defined benefit schemes of the State's largest private and public sector companies increased by 50% in 2014 and that the average level of the equity markets in those schemes decreased by 49%.  In the same period, there was average pension scheme growth of double digits in standard managed funds, yet the level of funding of the underfunded schemes increased by more than 90%.  Only one company reported that it had sufficient funds to meet its funded liabilities.  The average funding level of schemes fell from 86% in 2013 to 83% in 2014.  This is in the context of a market that is on its way up.<\/p><p>This is happening because all of these employers - public, private and semi-State commercial - have seen what has been allowed to happen at Aer Lingus to the Irish aviation superannuation scheme, IASS, and spotted a way out via single insolvency.  If profitable companies run down their pension schemes, they can extricate themselves and write off the schemes' deficits.  This is happening on the Government's watch.  Private schemes are preparing to boot members out of their defined benefit arrangements and place them in inferior schemes.  It will happen wholesale.  Under my first amendment, what occurred with the IASS could not happen again unless a scheme reached a 90% funding rate, at which point it would be more equitable and a lesser reduction would be vested upon its members.<\/p><p>The other amendments relate specifically to the IASS.  I do not want to delay the House.  I do not know how many times I have raised this issue but no one can stand over what has happened to the 15,000 people in that pension scheme.  It was done to permit the sale of Aer Lingus.  The Government could not sell Aer Lingus with a pension deficit of &euro;700 million plus.  Instead, facilitating legislation was introduced and the State received a paltry &euro;342 million, none of which is legally allowed to be invested in the pension scheme to reduce its deficit.  The people who have paid for the sale of the State's share are the 15,000 IASS members, in particular the 5,000 retirees, many of them in their 80s, who have lost six weeks' pay and the further 5,000 members who have lost significant benefits.  The active members have significantly inferior pension arrangements with lesser benefits for them at retirement.<\/p><p>The same company that advised the trustees of the IASS in Aer Lingus is advising other semi-State commercial companies on their pension arrangements.  They will do the same thing.  It is also happening with private pension schemes.  I have the details but I will not mention the companies' names because it would not be appropriate to do so in the House.  All of this will make it more difficult to provide for pensions in the future and to entice people into schemes.  I have mentioned a number of other reasons as to why I believe this will be the case.  I am speaking as someone who worked for 15 years in the pension sector before entering the Oireachtas.  I would not advise anyone to take out a pension now.  The situation is insecure because the foundation of pensions as a secure form of savings has been badly undermined by the private pension levy, what happened with the IASS and the changes to legislation that allow profitable companies to wind down their schemes instantly, high-tail it off and write off the deficits.  People would be better off putting their money in post offices.  Until we change pensions to become lifetime savings plans from which individuals can access funds at certain times, for example, to buy a house, get married or pay down debt via specific arrangements, I would tell people not to go near a pension based on what has happened in the past three or four years.  We have failed miserably in that regard.<\/p><p>What can anyone say to the members of the Tara Mines pension scheme who lost more than one month in benefit payments to pay for the private pension levy?  Ironically, the IASS, which was effectively wound down with the assistance of the Government, had to pay the pension levy in cash.  The scheme's members are suffering for that.  Many joined the scheme because it was compulsory while some made additional voluntary contributions and did what Governments of all hues told them to do down the years, namely, provide for their retirements.  They made their sacrifices.  They did not blow it all on a horse.  After making that provision, they found that their legs had been taken out from under them.  It was wrong.<\/p><p>I will not delay the House further.  I will continue to fight on this issue.  However, we should ensure that what occurred in this instance never happens with any other pension scheme.  Whoever is in government next should give a commitment to the members of the IASS that the savage cuts to their scheme will be reduced, be it by way of a levy on other arrangements or a special payment.  I hope that I have made my point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#Z01000","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Senator is correct.  I have heard him debate this issue many times with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  I will not go over the details again.  In fairness, the Senator has told me that he does not wish for me to do that.  A few brief comments have been made several times.  It is important to note again that the decision to wind up defined benefit schemes does not rest with the sponsoring employer but with the trustee.  We have also debated the trustee's responsibilities, engagement and consultation.<\/p> <p>Generally speaking, there is merit in the Senator's proposal.  However, it would give rise to unintended consequences.  As we exit the recession and enter recovery, we need to be careful in the context of how we balance measures.  Many of the Senator's points need to be considered as part of an overall review of pensions.  I look forward to starting that process with him as early as possible in the term of a new Government.  It would be an excellent debate to begin in committee hearings, from which a strong report could be produced.  Like the Senator, I believe that pensions will present one of the next Government's greatest challenges.  How we deal with it will be important and affect the country for decades.<\/p> <p>The policy on defined benefit schemes has been to nurse them back into compliance.  We are getting there.  The average level of funding for non-compliant schemes was approximately 78% of the funding standard.  This figure is based on a review of 140 of the 300 schemes.  Work and research have been done but there is much that needs to be addressed.  Some of it can be handled through guidance from the Departments of Finance and Social Protection on how trustees should operate.  The statistics are new to me.  There are approximately 62,000 schemes, each of which has a set of trustees and governance measures.  The number of trustees must run into the thousands.<\/p> <p>I will be brief because the Senator asked me to be civil.  I cannot accept his proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#AA00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Is the Senator pressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#AA00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#AA00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"vote","time":1449052200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 16; N\u00edl, 21.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson; N\u00edl, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#BB00100","aye":["1157","1116","1159","1131","1209","1149","1128","1136","1115","1139","1169","1127","1142","1200","1164","1176"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1208","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1172","1152","1135","1161","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1125","1171"]},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I propose to extend the time by five minutes to allow us complete Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#CC00100","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2015 in the Seanad.  The primary background to this Bill is the package of measures that was recently approved by the Government to deal with problems being observed in the Irish housing market.  I note that the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, which is another component of this package, has just been passed by the other House and will now go for signature.  The housing package, which is entitled \"Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply\", followed on from extensive engagement between the Minister for Finance and me, as well as our colleagues in various Departments.  It encompasses a comprehensive range of measures to improve the operation of the private rental sector, tackle increasing homelessness and support increased housing supply.  The rent stability measures in the package, which are primarily intended to give greater protection to tenants in the private rented sector, are being progressed separately in the Bill I have just mentioned, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  All of this follows on from the unprecedented &euro;4 billion package for the provision of social housing in the period to 2020, which I announced earlier this year.<\/p> <p>While the provision of new social housing and the enhancement of the operation of the private rental sector are essential to help to counteract homelessness and provide tenants with greater certainty with regard to security of tenure and the level of rent that is applied, boosting housing supply is also critical if we are to address our overall housing problems.  The current shortage of housing supply is unquestionably one of the most pressing and challenging priorities currently faced by the Government.  It is particularly acute in Dublin, where demand for housing well outstrips supply.  There are increasing issues in Galway, Cork and other areas.  This shortage of supply has consequential knock-on effects for house prices and rents, and has a negative impact on thousands of households throughout the country.<\/p> <p>The housing package that was announced last month contains some important measures to help to address the housing supply shortage problem.  It introduces a targeted development contribution rebate scheme to support and make more economically viable the delivery of affordable starter homes in Dublin and Cork.  These homes will be required to be completed and sold in 2016 and 2017.  The housing package also provides for the Ireland Strategic Infrastructure Fund to offer financial support for the provision of housing-related enabling infrastructure in large-scale priority development areas.  These measures are in addition to previous actions, including the 26% reduction in development contributions in the Dublin area.  The legislative changes enacted in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 will allow these development contribution reductions to be applied to certain unactivated planning permissions.  The same Act provides for reductions in the Part V obligations that are imposed on developers in providing social and affordable housing.  It is estimated that this will reduce housing costs by up to &euro;10,000 per housing unit.  The suite of actions already being implemented under the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 strategy aim to restore the wider construction sector and increase activity in that sector generally.<\/p> <p>Two further elements of the housing package that was announced last month which are designed to increase housing supply require legislative underpinning and are incorporated in the Bill I am presenting today.  The first of these measures will ensure planning authorities do not seek requirements above the national standards set out in ministerial planning guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, for example in relation to apartment standards.  The second measure will streamline the arrangements for the making of modifications to strategic development zone planning schemes, which are commonly known as SDZs.  I would like to set out the main provisions of the Bill that is before us for consideration today.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Alan Kelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2218\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2218&amp;amp;pid=AlanKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Bill contains seven sections which propose to amend sections 28 and 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, as well as Part IX of the Act, as follows.  Section 1 provides for the necessary definitions.  Sections 2 and 3 provide for amendments in connection with ministerial planning guidelines issued to planning authorities.<\/p><p>Section 2 amends section 28 of the Planning and Development Act relating to the issuing of ministerial planning guidelines to planning authorities.  Section 28 currently provides that planning authorities shall have regard to ministerial guidelines in the performance of their planning functions, such as in the determination of planning applications and the adoption of development plans.  The amendment elaborates on this by introducing a new power whereby the Minister may, within the section 28 guidelines, expressly state specific national planning policy requirements to be applied by planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate, in the exercise of their functions.  Therefore, the content of guidelines will distinguish between advisory or general commentary on the one hand and specific requirements that must be mandatorily applied by planning authorities.<\/p><p>This amendment is a critical underpinning to revisions that will shortly issue to replace the current 2007 apartment standard guidelines which will contain specific new requirements for minimum apartment sizes, the number of lifts per number of apartments, car parking provision, floor to ceiling heights, the provision of dual aspect apartments and so on with a view to ensuring their consistent application.  Such new revised guidelines would represent a change in national planning policy which should accordingly, on foot of this amendment, be implemented by planning authorities in the determination of planning applications and the adoption of development plans.  The amendment will also enable future revisions to any other current guidelines, such as development management guidelines and sustainable residential development, or to new planning guidelines that may be developed to be expressed and applied in a clearer manner and will improve consistency and certainty in the planning process generally by distinguishing in policy terms between matters to be determined locally and by national policy.<\/p><p>Section 3 of the Bill further underpins this approach by addressing a number of supplementary amendments required to section 34 of the Act of 2000 relating to the granting of planning permissions by planning authorities.  This first amendment in this section will require planning authorities to expressly consider any specific national planning policy requirements arising from section 28 guidelines issued by the Minister in the determination of planning applications.<\/p><p>The second amendment provides, for the avoidance of doubt, that where such guidelines and the standards or provisions of a local development plan differ, the national planning policy as reflected in ministerial guidelines shall prevail and take precedence.  This amendment will, for example, preclude the adoption by local authorities of their own local standards, thereby preventing a multiplicity of approaches throughout the country, and will require local authorities to comply with the national guidelines issued by the Minister of the time.<\/p><p>The third amendment in section 3 is aimed at streamlining the assessment of applications seeking modifications to existing planning permissions in respect of multi-unit housing developments, primarily apartment block and duplex type developments, on foot of the issuing of new or revised apartment standard guidelines by the Minister of the time.  The amendment will restrict the assessment of any such planning applications to the modifications proposed for the purpose of complying with any new guidelines and so that the whole previously granted permission and the question of the suitability of the development for housing as already determined is not reopened.  In the case of internal changes only, for instance, in relation to an apartment block, arising from new or revised apartment standard guidelines and where there is no materially significant change to the external structure of the development, the amendment precludes the right of third party appeal.<\/p><p>Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill amend the existing provisions of the Planning and Development Act of 2000 relating to strategic development zone, SDZ, planning schemes.  Section 4 amends section 169 of the Act of 2000 relating to the procedures to be followed in the adoption and approval of SDZ planning schemes.  SDZs are set by Government order and designate areas which are considered to be of economic or social importance to the State.  Following designation, planning schemes setting out objectives for specified development in designated areas are drawn up by prescribed development agencies, which may include a local authority, in respect of the designated areas concerned and are subject to public consultation procedures before being submitted to the elected members of the relevant planning authority for adoption.<\/p><p>The experience has been that all SDZ planning schemes which have been approved by planning authorities to date have been appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for final determination.  Under the current section 169 provisions, An Bord Plean&aacute;la can only make modifications to an SDZ scheme where they are considered to be minor in nature and are therefore unlikely to have significant effects on the environment or on a European site designated under the habitats or birds directives.  Where An Bord Plean&aacute;la considers that the scheme requires modification of a more material nature, it is effectively required to uphold the appeal and refuse the modification, requiring the re-commencement of the overall SDZ planning scheme process under section 169 if the relevant planning authority or development agency wishes to pursue the scheme with the proposed modifications.<\/p><p>Section 4 amends the current section 169 provisions to provide that An Bord Plean&aacute;la can, as before, approve an SDZ planning scheme with modifications of a minor nature.  However, under the new section 4 provisions, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will now also be allowed to approve the SDZ planning scheme with a modification or modifications which would constitute a material change to the scheme provided that such modification or modifications would not constitute a change in the overall objectives of the scheme concerned.  These new arrangements would mean that where modifications of a material nature are considered necessary by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, the relevant planning authority or development agency responsible for bringing forward the scheme would not have to recommence the whole SDZ planning scheme process.<\/p><p>The proposed new procedures insert considerable checks to ensure that where proposed modification or modifications of a material nature to an SDZ planning scheme may have significant effects on the environment, An Bord Plean&aacute;la shall require the planning authority to undertake a strategic environmental assessment as per the EU SEA directive, an appropriate assessment as per the EU habitats directive, or both such assessments in relation to the proposed modifications; undertake a full public consultation on the proposed changes, including the forwarding of the proposed changes to prescribed bodies, publishing notice of the proposed changes in local newspapers and putting them on public display for a minimum of four weeks; and following the public consultation, prepare a detailed report for submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for its consideration.  Where An Bord Plean&aacute;la makes a determination to make a modification constituting a material change to an SDZ planning scheme, it shall approve the scheme with the modification and notify the relevant planning authority or development agency accordingly.<\/p><p>While these revised procedures for the modification of planning schemes will take some time, having regard to the built-in public display and public consultation timeframes, they will still save considerable time in the making of a modification or modifications deemed necessary compared to having to recommence the overall SDZ process again.  This process can take up to two years under the current provisions based on previous SDZ planning schemes and can lead to significant delays in the progression of SDZs with consequential delays in the provision of housing and other commercial development.<\/p><p>Section 5 inserts a new section 170A into the Planning and Development Act to provide for a new more flexible process for the amendment of an already approved SDZ planning scheme.  As indicated, this is not possible under the current SDZ provisions where any amendment to a scheme requires the commencement of the overall SDZ planning scheme process once again.  The new provisions in section 5 will allow a planning authority, on its own behalf where it is promoting an SDZ scheme or on behalf of a development agency promoting an SDZ planning scheme, to make an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for an amendment to a previously approved SDZ scheme which may be in the course of being developed.  Such a request may be in respect of modifications which are minor in nature or, though material in nature, meet certain specified criteria and do not affect the overall objectives of the scheme.  The new provisions would in effect allow for amendments to an already approved SDZ scheme, as determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, following procedures along the lines of those contained in section 4, as stated - involving the undertaking of a strategic environmental assessment, an appropriate assessment or both, as required along with mandatory public consultation, but which would take a considerably shorter time than the current procedures requiring the commencement of the overall SDZ process again.<\/p><p>Section 6 is consequential to sections 4 and 5, and proposes the replacement of the existing section 171 of the 2000 Act relating to the revocation and amendment of SDZ planning schemes with a new section 171. The new procedures relating to the modification of SDZ planning schemes are provided for in sections 4 and 5 as outlined.  Consequently, section 6, inserting a replacement section 171 in the 2000 Act now only provides for the procedures relating to the revocation of SDZ planning schemes.<\/p><p>Section 7 contains standard provisions relating to the Short Title, construction and collective citation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Alan Kelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2218\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2218&amp;amp;pid=AlanKelly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Members will agree that this Bill contains a number of fundamental and important revisions to the Planning and Development Act 2000, emanating from the Government&rsquo;s housing package - Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply &ndash; which are necessary to support increased housing supply which I presume everyone in the House would support.  <\/p><p>As I have outlined, the amendments to sections 28 and 34 of the planning Act strengthen the status of aspects of ministerial guidelines to planning authorities to ensure their consistent application, particularly in relation to the proposed issue of revised apartment standard guidelines, throughout the country and will require local authorities to comply with the national guidelines.  This new provision will particularly apply in the first instance to revised apartment standard guidelines which I propose to issue shortly.  Even allowing for some reductions in the minimum floor areas as are currently applied by some local authorities, the revised guidelines will still ensure minimum floor sizes which will be among the most generous in Europe.<\/p><p>In addition, the amendments to the Part 9 provisions in relation to SDZ planning schemes will streamline the process for making modifications to such planning schemes which are not yet approved and are going through the approval process, as well as to planning schemes which have already been approved, thereby bringing greater flexibility in relation to the modification of SDZ schemes than is possible at present.<\/p><p>SDZ planning schemes are by their nature large projects where the proposed development works can take a number of years to complete.  They also contain a significant number of residential units and the timely delivery of SDZs in the Dublin area is critical to underpinning future housing supply. <\/p><p>These SDZ streamlining proposals will also complete action 24 of the Construction 2020 strategy aimed at revitalising the construction sector and bringing on stream housing units at a faster rate than at present.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#NN00700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

It follows on from recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, notwithstanding current challenges in housing.  While we are supporting it, one of the concerns is that if some guidelines of planning institutions go beyond the national standards in terms of quality and what they bring to it, we would not seek to undermine those or give a blanket no to any improvements.<\/p><p>I am specifically speaking about the situation in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council which has plans and regulations for passive housing in particular.  Nationally, we should be opposed to that on the basis that it is too cumbersome and will take too long and is too expensive and so on to allow that go on.  I would not have that perspective on it and I ask that while ensuring the Minister has adequate powers to get the right policy across each local authority in the country, that in certain instances where that is surpassed by the initiative of those councils themselves then we should welcome that and facilitate it to the extent possible.<\/p><p>On the surface, passive housing can be looked at as being more expensive.  If we were undertaking a large development where a lot of stuff is prefabricated it could actually be less expensive.  We should be careful on that issue and not have it written in stone that if local authority A or local authority B is going an extra mile on certain aspects, we do not say an automatic &quot;No&quot; and that, at a minimum, we would look at it on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>Obviously there is an SDZ aspect to it.  It is essential that there is a centralised involvement, while not wishing to take from local planners, councillors or the executives of the councils in terms of their input to major projects throughout the country.  If nothing else it is important when the correct project is being planned that while everyone has the opportunity to comment on it and there is a planning process in place for it, we have it streamlined so that it is not an application on the never never.  It is important that the Government of the day has the powers to intervene quickly to facilitate the process, albeit that it may not work out in favour of the development overall.  While the Minister mentioned that this was very much with a housing crisis in mind and the fact that we have a national crisis, he has been looking at having different measures from modular housing to rent controls implemented that will make life easier for the 700,000 people in the rental sector.  <\/p><p>I wish to make a few suggestions.  Local authorities throughout the country seem to have a basic self-determined rule of not buying or renting houses in former council schemes.  Certainly in Sligo that is part of the policy.  I think that is wrong and a bad policy.  The Minister's officials could do worse than to check with each of the local authorities.  It is an unwritten rule but certainly, in practice, it does not happen in Sligo.  The reason is that the local authority wants to get to a situation which was perhaps the vision of Part V that we have full integration between people who are mortgaging their houses to people who are in social and affordable housing and so on.  That is very honourable if one is dealing with a blank canvas.  Sadly, nationally, that is not the case so we have to take cognisance of the social balance in a number of places.  I use Sligo as an example.  Throughout the Part 5 era, any developments had to have that or they had to swap their land or pay money in lieu.  In Sligo we had the third highest social mix in the country, after Cork and Limerick.  With a national average of about 14% to 16%, Sligo was 33%, Cork was marginally more than that and I think Limerick was 36% or thereabouts, give or take a percentage, or maybe I am forgetting the figures.  While we all want more social housing we have to be cognisant of what the landscape looks like and how we can best meet the challenges.  <\/p><p>Looking at the former scheme, this will be a short-term measure.  How many former local authority homes lying empty throughout the country are for sale?  I can assure the House one can buy four for the price of a house on the open market.  There is probably a stock of housing around the country that at a minimum can provide a short-term measure.  Presumably these units would have be refurbished but I am sure that solution would be at least as quick as modular housing and in parallel with modular housing.  Obviously that is being done and it is welcome.<\/p><p>Developers cannot get money.  Leaving aside all the boom, bust and the developers we all grew to vilify and hate who led us down the track, it is evident we are missing developers who are prepared to take risks, get capital and build houses.  It is not happening because they cannot get money.  Most builders who were involved for a number of years were either so big that they are dealing with NAMA or have refinanced themselves abroad and are going again.  However, the average developer who built 30 houses per year is either a bankruptcy tourist or is negotiating with the banks here and has a bad credit rating and they just will not give him or her any money.  That is a real problem and I am not sure how we can deal with it.  I know there is the Strategic Investment Bank but its money is at a rate of 16%.  If its interest rates are at that level, one would need to come in with a squeaky clean track record.  If one is up on the credit bureau I do not think it would lend one 50 cent.  This is an issue we need to look at. <\/p><p>In planning nationally we have to take cognisance of the fact that people live outside cities and towns throughout the country.  I know the Minister is from a rural county.  County Leitrim has a major problem.  We are using the excuse nationally to say there are loads of houses for sale.  If a person wants to build a house in Sligo he or she will ask for a site but <i>Daft.ie<\/i>and <i>MyHome.ie<\/i>state there are 150 houses for sale.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marc MacSharry:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2010\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2010&amp;amp;pid=MarcMacSharry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There was a rule some years ago where the child of a farmer, while not guaranteed planning, would be facilitated subject to the design and the correct septic tank system being installed.  The Minister of State would do the nation a service if she would look at this possibility.  There are specific grounds for it in County Leitrim where there is a particular issue with soil.  Not all people in Ireland live in cities and we must provide for that.<\/p><p>A radical proposal on the housing issue was suggested to me recently.  It might produce giggles from some Members but my belief is that if one is to dream, one should dream big.  One might then come up with a workable solution.  There will be an underspend in each of the Departments, apart from the Departments of Health and Social Protection, and hundreds of millions will come back in.  That money could be used to purchase compulsorily the housing stock that underlies the security on loans sold by IBRC to Mars Capital and Pepper.  They would have paid a knock-down rate for them so they could be made the subject of a compulsory purchase order, CPO, at an appropriate level and this would provide cheap housing stock for us throughout the country.  It might open up problems on the other side in that some of the housing could be in areas overpopulated with social housing or on land swapped under Part V obligations, but if there are underspends in each Department next year, we will not be able to increase spending accordingly because of the new rules coming in.  I can see that the Minister of State is thinking of her Christmas break and feels all this is too radical for her to embrace, but the likes of Mars Capital and Pepper do not care about the property, the loan or the client.  They just care about profit.  They bought books of loans for a certain sum and they are happy to sell them to regain their money plus a margin.  If somebody looked into this, it could provide us quickly with a supply of stock.<\/p><p>We welcome the Bill and look forward to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#PP00800","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I welcome much of what Senator MacSharry said but one sentence struck me.  He said \"if one is to dream, one should dream big\".  We have to be careful that this Government does not end up in a nightmare situation.  The Minister said housing was his main priority and that we must ensure the utmost is done to ensure the homeless situation is addressed.<\/p> <p>The Bill represents a change in national policy guidelines.  There is a huge shortage in housing and it must be addressed but I have some reservations about the means whereby we are doing it.  Nevertheless, drastic measures are needed to make houses available.  Development is not taking place anywhere at the required rate.  Why is this?  As Professor Ronan Lyons from Trinity College said, the cost of development at the moment is not enticing any developer to build houses.  Developers with high finance are purchasing office space but not residential.  Excluding the cost of the land, it would take a monthly rent of &euro;1,400 to justify the construction of a two-bedroom apartment.  Between 2011 and 2015 the monthly rent for a two-bedroom home in the centre of Dublin increased by 50%.  At the other end of the spectrum the cost of a five-bedroom family home in Donegal or Leitrim was almost unchanged while rents in Clare, Tipperary and other rural counties have seen single digit increases.  In a couple of years we should look at whether one size fits all in this respect.  Local councillors hate to see top-down regulations but the departmental guidelines are a one-size-fits-all approach.  In three years, it is hoped, the houses will be available and the figures will show that we can give more power back to the local authorities because that is where the power should be.<\/p> <p>Cities drive our economic growth so we have to ensure houses are made available there, and this Bill is one way of doing it.  The tight restrictions Dublin City Council imposed, which exceeded departmental guidelines on building apartments, regulated things like car parking spaces, orientation, balcony depth, ceiling height and the numbers of lifts per floors, which all add to the cost.  These guidelines were very good as they were to entice family living back into the city following the doughnut-shaped planning we had seen which caused everybody to move out to the suburbs.  I complimented Dublin City Council on what it did but the ordinary person cannot afford a house now because it is too expensive to buy and something has to be done to redress that.<\/p> <p>There has been a focus on developers over the question of why so few houses are being built, but the banks and international developers are also a factor.  The Central Bank has also capped house prices relative to our incomes to secure the country's financial stability, but nothing is being done to cap construction costs relative to our incomes in order that we can secure affordability.  This Bill will address some of those problems by changing regulations, including requiring a planning authority to undertake a strategic environmental assessment and making local authority development plans subject to national guidelines.<\/p> <p>I am cautious about the restrictions on local authority powers, but at this stage I believe these conditions are necessary.  I am pleased to see the streamlining of the strategic development modifications in section 4.  South Dublin won a European award for its strategic development zone, but changes to the guidelines are better than going back to the drawing board.  Development must begin and there can be no two-year delay while we put in place a new SDZ.  This applies to Cherrywood where more than 3,000 houses are to come on stream.<\/p> <p>Housing regulations were developed to guarantee that housing in this State supported a good quality of life.  It is important to emphasise that the building standards are not being lowered.  We are just making houses affordable.  The CSO requirements were for a 50% ratio of one-family living whereas Dublin City Council had a smaller ratio.  The two have to be streamlined.  The principle at the heart of these changes is that it is unacceptable to demand an increase in the living standards of our most secure citizens at the expense of those who are most vulnerable and who cannot afford to buy at the moment.  When Dublin city introduced changes in lifts and brought in dual aspects, there was almost a lift for every two or three apartments.  If there were six apartments there had to be an outside balcony as in the council estates of old.  Naturally, planners and designers would not go with that requirement.<\/p> <p>I have some reservations but the main one is the subjugation of local development plans to national policy.  I am a supporter of the devolution of powers to local authorities and my fear of usurping local powers comes from the recognition of the value of local needs.  Senator MacSharry spoke about Leitrim versus Dublin and I agree that if developers could buy and do up derelict local council houses, such as in Roscommon where I saw some last week, and lease them back to the local authority, it would be a good initiative.  Different localities have different needs and local councils know best what is needed in their counties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> There are many good reasons for doing what is being done in this Bill but reason enough would be the fact, as Dublin City Council has admitted, that the additional cost for a one-bedroom unit is &euro;22,000, &euro;15,000 for a two-bedroom unit and &euro;23,000 for a three-bedroom unit.  While the census shows the percentage of one-person households exceeds 50%, the council has indicated the percentage of one-bedroom units is at 20%.  In other words, there is a mismatch between what is needed according to the census and what the council is providing.  As a former councillor, I recall that when one saw \"have regard to\" in legislation, one tended to put that provision to one side and not give it a blind bit of notice.  Guidelines, on the other hand, require compliance.  We must give consideration to the question of whether one size fits all for all local authorities.  That is why a review of these provisions after three years is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#QQ00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan.  This Bill is one of several measures being introduced with a view to stabilising rents and boosting supply in the housing sector.  Increasing rents have led directly to an increase in the numbers, including the numbers of families, experiencing homelessness.  In this context, I welcome the passage through the D&aacute;il of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 and hope to see it signed into law shortly.  The Bill before us contains measures to improve the supply of housing, particularly in the rented sector.  We all agree that supply holds the key to solving many of the difficulties we face in the area of housing and homelessness.  There are two aspects to the legislation.  The first concerns the implementation of guidelines relating to the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the second is to do with strategic development zones, SDZs.  The SDZ provisions are progressive and will have a distinct impact in terms of facilitating a more efficient planning process.  In addition, they will fast-track the provision of modular housing, which is very welcome.  There are many anxious families waiting to move into those units.<\/p> <p>I have some concerns regarding the provisions in the Bill relating to national standards.  As a member of Dublin City Council's strategic policy committee for seven years and as chairman of Threshold, the issue of improving apartment standards was something for which I campaigned for years.  In 2006, 78% of all units built in the Dublin region were apartments.  The occupants of those units were not the type of people the glossy brochures were aimed at, namely, double-income couples with no children who would spend most of their weekends on city breaks.  In fact, the purchasers of the apartments were often single parents with children.  It became obvious that significant parts of the inner city of Dublin were rapidly deteriorating into slums which bore some resemblance to those that existed in the 1930s and 1940s.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that the standards which were introduced, both the national standards and the specific standards introduced by Dublin City Council, were introduced for very good reasons.  This Bill strengthens the national standards and provides that individual local authorities will not have the right to deviate from those standards.  Like Senator Keane, I have concerns that this might infringe on the rights of local authorities to determine policy for their own area.  Moreover, I am not convinced that the harmonisation of standards across the country is a good idea even though it might look like such in the first instance.  In Dublin, for example, where we have people living in high-demand and high-density areas and where, in some cases, apartment dwelling is the only option - as opposed to semi-detached homes or self-built dwellings - higher standards are necessary.  For increasing numbers of people, rented housing and apartment living are a lifelong reality.  In the coming years, we will see more and more people living in rented accommodation for the rest of their lives.  Already, one in five families is living in rent accommodation.<\/p> <p>The Bill proposes to reduce the minimum size of a one-bedroom unit in a context where more than 60% of households will be either one or two-person households.  In other words, we are looking at a significant number of people living in one-bedroom units.  I accept that the original Dublin City Council proposals had too few single-person units and also too few family units.  However, there needs to be a recognition of the significant percentage of people for whom a one-bedroom apartment will be their permanent accommodation.  A reduction in the minimum size from 55 sq. m to 45 sq. m should be compared with a national average of 50 sq. m in the UK and a German average of 60 sq. m.  Another issue to consider is that there is a question mark over the costings.  I have spoken to a number of people in the construction sector and they point out that an apartment which is 20% smaller will not be 20% cheaper to build.  In fact, the estimation is that the reduction in build cost will be some 5%.  There is a question mark over who will win in that particular scenario but it has been suggested it will be the developers.  How can we ensure any savings that are made by easing the standards in respect of apartment size will be passed on to the consumer?<\/p> <p>The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland recently conducted a survey among its members to ascertain the relative significance of different aspects of building costs.  The survey found that the most significant factor was bank finance, with 35% of respondents identifying it as the number one constraint.  Insufficient profitability was highlighted by 27%, while 17% identified the availability of mortgage finance as the main issue.  Land costs are clearly also a significant constraint.  We are in a situation where the equity gap for developers is in the region of 40%, which means many are forced to access very expensive mortgage finance.<\/p> <p>I accept we are in desperate times and we arguably need desperate measures.  However, we must ensure any changes we make are kept under review, particularly in very dense urban areas where there is a high proportion of apartment developments.  While I do not particularly favour the change being made here, I support it in the same way I support anything that can move matters forward.  I fully appreciate the Minister's bona fides in bringing the proposals to the House.  I reiterate that we must ensure any savings made are passed on to consumers.  Price is determined by supply and demand but we need measures to ensure there are benefits for people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aideen Hayden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2384\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2384&amp;amp;pid=AideenHayden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I suggest we consider legislation with policy interventions to manage the price of development land.

There were many interesting and varied contributions made and while I might not agree with all of them, I fully accept they were made in a genuine and constructive spirit.  As the Minister, Deputy Kelly, outlined in his opening statement, and as has been acknowledged by many Senators in their contributions, we are currently faced with pressing and complex problems in regard to the operation of the housing market which require swift, decisive and innovative action if they are to be addressed.  The housing package, Stabilising Rents, Boosting Supply, which was recently announced by the Government, contains a comprehensive range of measures to improve the operation of the private rental sector, tackle increasing homelessness and support increased housing supply.  This follows on from previous actions implemented by the Government to address our housing-related problems.<\/p> <p>While the provision of an unprecedented amount of new social housing units and enhancements to the operation of the private rental sector are essential to counteract homelessness and give tenants greater certainty in regard to security of tenure and the level of rents applied, boosting housing supply is also an essential ingredient to the overall mix of actions required to address the housing problems currently faced.  There is no single panacea or silver bullet to address the housing problems but I can assure Members of the House that this issue is, and has been, a top priority of the Government.<\/p> <p>The amendments to the Planning and Development Act proposed in this Bill emanate from the recently announced housing package, which will be legislatively underpinned on the enactment of this Bill.  The main measures in the Bill relate to ensuring that planning authorities do not seek requirements above national standards set out in ministerial planning guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and streamlining the arrangements for the making of modifications to strategic development zone, SDZ, planning schemes.<\/p> <p>As outlined earlier, the Minister is currently empowered under section 28 of the planning Act to issue guidelines to planning authorities to which they are required to have regard in the performance of their planning functions &mdash; for instance, in the determination of planning applications and the adoption of local development plans.  However, not all planning authorities apply such national guidelines in their entirety, giving rise to some inconsistent application of such ministerial guidelines.<\/p> <p>The apartment standard guidelines comprise a case in point.  For example, Dublin and Cork city councils currently apply higher apartment standards than the current 2007 guidelines, the net effect of which is an increase in apartment costs in both cities, which is affecting the delivery of necessary housing at this stage.  While Dublin City Council is currently considering this issue in its new development plan, there is a wider issue of consistent approaches to national policy issues as reflected in national guidelines that the Minister needs to address.<\/p> <p>Revised apartment standard guidelines will be issued shortly to replace the 2007 guidelines, which will contain specific new requirements in regard to minimum apartment sizes, the number of lifts per number of apartments, car parking provision, floor to ceiling heights, the provision of dual-aspect apartments and storage provision with a view to ensuring their consistent application.  It is estimated that the proposed revisions to the guidelines, which are still being finalised and which all planning authorities will be obliged to apply on enactment of this Bill, will deliver an average estimated cost reduction of &euro;20,000 per apartment in Dublin city, in addition to the other cost reductions which will already apply on foot of other previous Government actions.  These include the development contribution rebate scheme for affordable starter homes announced in the recent housing package, previous reductions in development contributions, in addition to the reductions in the Part V obligations on developers in regard to the provision of social and affordable housing as provided for in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act enacted last July.<\/p> <p>I have noted the reservations expressed by some Senators about reductions in apartment sizes in the revised guidelines.  However, I emphasise that these revisions, which are currently being finalised, will not become a race to the bottom for apartment standards.  Even allowing for some reductions in the minimum floor areas currently applied by Dublin and Cork city councils, we will still have minimum floor area sizes that will be among the most generous in Europe.<\/p> <p>The primary aim of the revised guidelines will be to promote sustainable urban housing by ensuring that the design and layout of new apartments going forward will provide satisfactory accommodation for a variety of household types and sizes &ndash; including families with children &ndash; over the medium to long term.  A further aim of the guidelines will be to make apartments more economically viable for developers to develop, and more affordable from the perspective of potential owner occupiers and renters alike.<\/p> <p>The reality is that minimal apartment development has taken place in both Dublin and Cork since their respective city councils&rsquo; own local standards were introduced.  This is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest.  Apartments should be developed taking account of real-world requirements and not aspirational standards, however well intended, that effectively put access to homes in some locations out of reach of ordinary citizens.<\/p> <p>The Bill is also not about eroding or reducing the powers of elected local authority members in regard to the adoption of local standards.  It is aimed at facilitating the development of well-designed and reasonably-sized apartments that are not presently being provided in certain local authority areas.  It is also aimed at ensuring the adoption of a consistent approach by all local authorities and that we do not have a multiplicity of approaches being applied throughout the country, which would be unsustainable.<\/p> <p>The clear view of the Government is that we need to ensure that development proposals, including in respect of apartments, are more economically viable and are provided at more affordable prices than at present, thereby facilitating increased housing supply, particularly in Dublin, where demand is most acute.  This will not only help counter house and apartment price increases but also have the ancillary benefit of helping to address rent increases in the private rental market.<\/p> <p>The streamlining of the procedures for the modification of proposed and previously approved SDZ planning schemes, as outlined in sections 4 to 6 of the Bill, are necessary in order to help bring on stream housing supply in such schemes much more speedily than at present, when any modifications to such schemes can take up to two years to be approved, thereby bringing development to a halt.<\/p> <p>The measures proposed in the Bill are designed to ensure any perceived barriers to housing supply from a planning perspective are addressed and that the planning system is fit for purpose in this regard and increasing housing construction activity.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.  I look forward to further engagement with Members as the Bill progresses through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#SS00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#SS00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#SS00500","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 8 December 2015.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012: Motion for Earlier Signature","time":1449052200,"counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#VV00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That, pursuant to subsection 2&deg; of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad &Eacute;ireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#VV00200","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Bill 2015: Report and Final Stages","time":1449052200,"counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#VV00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 7, to delete line 35 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(3) The chairperson of the Board shall be democratically elected by the members of the Board.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>We welcome this Bill in general and believe that putting the National Concert Hall on this footing will be beneficial to it.  We have praised the work being done there, the programmes it runs and the investment that has taken place.  We do feel there still needs to be a sense of autonomy in the board.  We note that the Minister gets to a point at which, after a process through the Public Appointments Service, suitable people are selected to serve on the board.  I argue that there is a particular dynamic around a board of management of any organisation, and the skill of being a chairperson is a very particular skill, which some people have and others do not.  We have seen examples of organisations that are run well because the chairperson can run particular meetings.  He or she may not have a particular skill in the arts, music or culture but may be particularly good at managing people, listening and empathising, and able to move an agenda along by making sure that everybody gets heard and certain people do not dominate.  Those who are best able to choose the person on the board who is best skilled to be the chairperson are the people who serve on the board.  I have seen organisations in which the chairperson has a public role or a background, history or experience in the arts or theatre, and perhaps great public speaking skills, but is not necessarily a great chairperson.  He or she could be quite dominant, have a great big ego and see him- or herself as being a step above the rest.<\/p><p>We do not think this amendment is a lot to ask.  It is something quite small and would leave the autonomy with the board.  It would show that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and any other subsequent Minister who is dealing with the National Concert Hall allows the board the autonomy to choose their own chairperson.  The Minister will have chosen every single other member of the board via the appointments process.  The Minister herself mentioned on Committee Stage that some of the people chosen might not be known to her, as she will be working from curricula vitae or other documents provided by the Public Appointments Service.  She may not have personal knowledge of the people concerned or know what their interpersonal skills are like.<\/p><p>I understand that a Minister would have to have a good working relationship with the chairperson of the board, but one would imagine that if all the members of the board are able to jump through the hoops of the Public Appointments Service process, any one of them should potentially be eligible to be a chairperson.  The Minister should have no issue working with anybody who has been chosen by the board as chairperson.  That is why we put this amendment forward.  It is not ground-shaking or radical in any way.  It would just send a very strong signal to the board of the National Concert Hall that it is an autonomous board the members of which stand alone and are allowed to do the job without interference from the Minister or subsequent Ministers in how the National Concert Hall is run.  We ask the Minister to consider this while she is putting through this positive Bill, which is a move forward.  We ask the Minister to take this amendment on board in the sprit in which it is put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#VV00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.  There is a lot of merit there.  If the board members have to go away and talk among themselves to choose who should be chairman, it would promote the kind of autonomy that is needed in cultural institutions and that we have always had in this State.  It is not really comparable with other State or semi-state bodies in that cultural institutions require autonomy, ideas and culture - the kind of expressions I heard the Minister use in her speech at the annual famine commemoration in Newry.  She spoke of broadening the famine into all of the traditions on the island of Ireland and different types of people.  Sometimes bureaucracy can stifle creativity.  Creativity and diversity, and the creative arts holding a mirror up to society as a whole, are the essence of what we are looking for in all the cultural institutions.  They are the elements by which we hold our cultural institutions in such esteem.

Sterling work has been done and the Minister displayed generosity and co-operation in allowing the cultural committee to deal with the Bill during pre-legislative scrutiny.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I are on that committee and we went through the Bill  in detail, line by line.  There were some problematic parts to it that were reworded and redrawn based on the evidence we received from independent witnesses.  As it is my first experience as a Senator and as a legislator, I welcomed the opportunity to work under the newly reformed system of pre-legislative scrutiny. If the Minister is to introduce any further Bills, and the sooner the better, they should be brought straight to the committee, as it is a valuable process.  It bring with it more expertise; it is open, and the Minister is open to it.  It allows Bills to be looked at and shaken down regarding any potential ambiguities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiach Mac Conghail:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2386\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2386&amp;amp;pid=FiachMacConghail&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am looking at the complications.  Will the Minister reassure the House that all appointments to the board are through the Public Appointments Service?  I need confirmation of that.  Will she also confirm that the chairperson, who will be an ordinary member, will go through PAS?  I would like the Minister to clarify whether there will be a specific separate job description for the chairperson, as opposed to ordinary members, or whether she will recruit for all board members of the National Concert Hall and out of that membership designate one person as chairperson?  If the chairperson were elected from among the members of the board, would the term of office of the chairperson be for the full term?  We know from subsection 5 that the chairperson of the board holds office for five years, but section 6 breaks down the term of office of other members from three to five years, with three members serving for three years, three other members for four years and two members for five years.  Would the term of office be problematic if we were to go down the route of electing a chairperson?  Would that contradict the appointment process through which the chairperson will be designated?  Let me put this question to the Minister.  Under subsection 6, does the Minister or the Public Appointments Service designate which members serve for three, four or five years?  I would like a response to that.  We are talking about eight members.  I presume the ninth is the chairperson.  I am highlighting - although I completely accept the bona fides of my fellow Senators - that this amendment is problematic.<\/p><p>I am the director of the Abbey Theatre, which is a national institution.  The chairperson of the Abbey Theatre was appointed by a Minister to a specific role and therefore I am assuming that the chairperson of each national institution will have a specific role and a specific job description and responsibility.  I would like to understand the relationship between the Public Appointments Service process and the appointment of the designated chairperson, as proposed in the Bill.  I wish to hear the Minister's views before I make my mind up on the proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#VV00800","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>We have to look at the history to date of appointments to the role of chairperson.

I do not mean that in any way as being a slight on the amendment.<\/p> <p>I believe the chairperson has to be a person who is equipped for the role.  While it is true to say the Minister may not always know the people on the board, he or she will take advice and will be aware of what is happening in the marketplace.  Unless I saw particularly strong merit in doing this, or we had glaring cases in the past in which it had not worked well, I would be inclined to think that change might not be the best way to go in this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#WW00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>As Senators will be aware section, 10(3) provides that the Minister shall designate one member of the board to be the chairperson for a period of five years.<\/p> <p>In response to Senator Mac Conghail, who asked how the term of board members would be determined, lots will be drawn to determine those who will serve for three, four or five years.  The chairperson will be appointed for the full five-year term.<\/p> <p>The effect of this amendment would be to provide that the chairperson be elected by the board members.  We had a very interesting and wide-ranging debate on Committee Stage, for which I thank the Senators.  The rationale behind this provision focuses on the nature of the relationship between the Minister and the chairperson.  As I have said previously, the chairperson of any State board has an important position as head of the board and has the responsibility of overseeing the management and direction of the organisation.  It is equally important that the chairperson has an effective working relationship with the Minister, as the chairperson forms an essential bridge between the board and the Minister.  The issue of transparency around the process was raised on Committee Stage, and Senators will be aware that the norm in the majority of State boards is that the Minister appoints the chairperson.  Examples include the provisions in the Sport Ireland Act 2015, the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, the Further Education and Training Act 2013, the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, and the Arts Act 2003.<\/p> <p>Under the Public Appointments Service system, an independent panel assesses all applications for appointment to the State board and a short list is sent to the Minister, who makes the board appointments having examined and assessed the skill set involved.  In my case, I discuss it with my officials so that we can find the best people for the job.  The application process allows interested parties who have applied for a position on the board to indicate whether they would like to serve as a chairperson.  It will also allow them to outline to the Minister why they would be qualified to do the job.  Having all of this knowledge regarding the skill set, the Minister makes the decision on who to appoint to the chair.<\/p> <p>When a new board is appointed, I believe the members of the new board would not have the necessary information regarding the skill sets of their fellow board members to make an informed decision as to who was the best person for the position of chairperson.  A chairperson needs a particular set of skills.  I am satisfied that the Minister of the day, whoever it is, will have access to all of the CVs and will also have access to the people who are interested in taking the role of chairperson, and all interested members will have outlined their skill sets and abilities.  The Minister will have that information but - let me repeat - the new board would not have that type of information and would be making a decision without the benefit of that information.  As members will be aware, prospective chairpersons now appear before a joint committee of the Oireachtas prior to their appointment, and this allows Members an involvement in the scrutiny process.  We all want to ensure we have the most effective process possible for selecting the best possible chairperson.  Senator O'Keeffe, in her contribution on Committee Stage, alluded to the potential difficulties with a new group whose members are drawn together for the first time who are then asked to make a decision as to whom the group wants as chairperson.<\/p> <p>Members may have differing views on achieving the same objective, but the objective we all share is an effective process for appointing the chairperson.  I have listed with interest to the debate on both Committee and Report Stages.  My view is that the Minister of the day should continue to appoint the chairpersons of public bodies such as the National Concert Hall.  The legislation sets out clear lines of accountability through the Minister to the Oireachtas.  It is important, therefore, that the Minister appoint the chairperson.  I have gone a long way towards ensuring the independence of the National Concert Hall, and section 8 expresses that.  I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#WW00300","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments.  I do not want to labour the point, because I do not think the future of the National Concert Hall will hinge on this amendment, but I respectfully differ in opinion from herself and Senator Mac Conghail.  I do not think any of the points they have raised are insurmountable.  In a scenario where there is a new board coming together, one could put an interim chairperson in place for the first meeting or two and then, when the members of the board have got to know each other, let them appoint whom they think is most appropriate.  I also think it is possibly a bit condescending to say that the board members would not be in a position to choose from among those who have been appointed to the board somebody suitable for the role of chairperson, and that the Minister would know better because she will have read all the CVs.  I take it that all of the CVs could be made available to the board members, which would put them in a very good position to choose a chairperson, knowing the area very well and having expertise in the area.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I can appreciate that this is a difference of policy.

Brigid McManus, who did the report for the Department, found the governance of the National Concert Hall was very good and she supported it.  She is a very senior and distinguished public servant.  This is, as Senator Mac Conghail said, a great institution.  His committee did the pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>My own concerns on the Bill were about section 18(9), which states that \"the chief executive officer shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy\".  That is only at the Committee of Public Accounts, but in general our Constitution gives citizens the right to freely express their convictions and opinions.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, it goes on to discuss preserving the rightful liberty of expression in the radio, press and cinema, but it has always been so in the older cultural institutions, like musical institutions and the Abbey Theatre, whose director is with us.  We should be very relaxed on that.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the line \"Stick close to your desks and never go to sea, And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navee!\" in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" was subversive, but it was satire on how the upper class bypassed any public appointments commission and became major figures in the admiralty.  I do not think \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" should be banned because of those sentiments.<\/p> <p>Let us have open, expressive arts as a major contributor to this society, enriching North-South relations and relations between Ireland and the world.  It is a major part of how Ireland presents itself to the world.  I echo the sentiments of Senator Mac Conghail.  I did not know it was the Minister's first Bill, but it is a pretty good place to start and I wish her and the National Concert Hall every success.  It is such a valuable institution.  Along with the Iveagh Gardens which are behind it, it is a major cultural complex, which has been of inestimable value to the city of Dublin and to this country.  Long may it prevail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#XX01000","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"International Protection Bill 2015: Order for Second Stage","time":1449052200,"counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#XX01200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":414,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Second Stage be taken now.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#XX01300","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"International Protection Bill 2015: Second Stage","time":1449052200,"counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#XX01500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the International Protection Bill 2015 to the House and I look forward to engaging with Members as we progress the Bill.

This delivers on the commitment given in the statement of Government priorities to legislate to reduce the length of time the asylum applicant spends in the asylum determination system and consequently in direct provision through the establishment of a single applications procedure.  The Government has, therefore, singled out this aspect of our immigration and asylum system and given it special priority so that it can be addressed with specific and timely focus under today's Bill.  It is also intended that the Bill will be in compliance with the United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees and with the related EU directives on asylum procedures and qualification into which Ireland has opted.<\/p> <p>The publication of the Bill and its early enactment and implementation is also a key recommendation of the report of the working group on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers, which I and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, established.  The very welcome report was published on 30 June 2015.  The Bill now responds to 26 of the working group's recommendations.  I thank the Members of both Houses who contributed to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which issued an interim report in July.<\/p> <p>The recent refugee flows to, and across, our continent, and the life-threatening risks that are being taken, highlight the fact that the asylum and protection process is one that very much has a human dimension.  Its application procedure has human beings and communities on both ends.  The introduction of a new and streamlined procedure will, in my view, help remove some of the human stresses and strains that have arisen for all concerned under the present cumbersome and multi-layered application framework and its ensuing delays.  We are all very familiar with these.  A very real sense of who we are dealing with under the Bill, and why we are doing so, is conveyed by the fact that international protection can be secured either as a person who is eligible for refugee protection on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution in the country of origin, or as a person who is eligible for subsidiary protection on the basis of a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to the country of origin.  Under the Bill's proposed procedure, an applicant will make one application only, and will have all grounds for seeking international protection and for being permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process.<\/p> <p>In keeping with the Geneva Convention, persecution can arise under the Bill by reason of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group.  Acts of persecution are defined in the Bill as constituting a severe violation of human rights.  The term \"serious harm\" is defined to include execution, torture or serious threat to a civilian's life in a situation of armed conflict.  The term \"international protection\" is defined as status in the State either as a refugee or as a person eligible for subsidiary protection on the basis of a declaration given under the Bill.<\/p> <p>In broad terms, the introduction of the single application procedure will include the following benefits: Ireland's international protection system will be brought into line with other EU member states; there will be speedier processing of new applications for international protection; and there will be a significantly reduced time for applicants in direct provision accommodation and in its costs to the State.<\/p> <p>Under section 6 of the Bill changes will be made to current legislation.  In particular, the Refugee Act will be repealed.  Originally enacted in 1996, it has been heavily amended over the years and its provisions will be significantly updated by the Bill.  The Bill will also see the revocation of a number of sets of regulations made under the European Communities Act in the period 2006 to 2015 for the purpose of giving effect in Irish law to provisions of EU directives in the field of asylum.  I am very pleased that the Bill provides the opportunity to consolidate these aspects.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to a balanced migration policy.  While the reform to the protection system will ensure that Ireland effectively lives up to our international humanitarian obligations, the accompanying changes to the immigration laws will ensure the following that Ireland is equally effective in enforcing deportations and border controls to prevent and tackle those wishing to enter and remain illegally in the country without proper cause.  The Bill contains important new amendments to the Immigration Acts relating to deportation and border control and is also aimed at improving the effectiveness of legislative provisions dealing with the arrest, detention and removal of non-nationals against whom a deportation is in force; the removal from the State of persons refused leave to land, of whom there are more than 3,000 every year; the appointment of immigration officers in the context of the ongoing civilianisation of border control duties; and the designation of an approved port for the purposes of entry into the State.<\/p> <p>The enactment of the Bill will involve key structural changes being made to the present administration of our asylum and protection regime.  The Bill's repeal of the Refugee Act 1996 will effectively abolish the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  A new international protection appeals tribunal will replace the existing Refugee Appeals Tribunal, providing effective remedy against decisions taken on applications including a decision to refuse.  The new tribunal will be independent in its functions and designed to enable the efficient conduct of its business and consistency in its decisions.<\/p> <p>The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner will be replaced by a dedicated unit within the Department acting as the determining authority at first instance for applications for international protection.  This unit will be known as the protection office.  Existing staff and others experienced in the processing of protection applications, who are trained to UNHCR standards, will transfer to this office.  The existing management team in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner will also play a significant role in seeing through the establishment and functioning of the new office.  Priority will be given to ensuring that existing best practice and standards in the processing of asylum and subsidiary protection applications will be embedded and maintained under the new dispensation.<\/p> <p>I will now turn to the architecture and provisions of the new Bill.  In so doing I will point to its provisions, rather than go into detail section by section.  An explanatory memorandum is also available.  The Bill consists of 77 sections laid out in 13 parts which are followed by two schedules.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Part 1 contains the usual commencement, interpretation and definition sections.<\/p><p>Part 2 of the Bill deals with qualification for international protection and consists of sections 7 to 12, inclusive.  These provisions are intended to be in compliance with the EU directive which I have mentioned.  The directive was adopted in 2004 and recast in 2011 to ensure a uniform status in the EU member states for refugees or persons eligible for subsidiary protection.  The Bill has been prepared in compliance with the 2011 recast of the original directive.<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill deals with applications for international protection and consists of sections 13 to 25, inclusive.  That goes into the detail about the preliminary interviews, and that if there is an unaccompanied minor coming, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency needs to be told that he or she is seeking to make an application.  Obviously, we have got much better and have much better procedures in this country for dealing with unaccompanied minors.  It is noteworthy in the current movement across the Mediterranean and through Balkans that there is a high percentage of unaccompanied minors.<\/p><p>Sections 15 to 17, inclusive, set out the procedure for making an application for international protection and giving permission to an applicant to remain in the State for the duration of the single procedure.  Then there are various provisions, which allow for the issuing to an applicant a statement in writing specifying the procedures to be followed and on the taking of the fingerprints of applicants.  Section 20 provides for grounds for the detention of an applicant under the supervision of the District Court.  Section 23 provides that the Minister or the International Protection Appeals Tribunal may require an examination of an applicant's physical or psychological health, and there are various other sections in that part.<\/p><p>Part 4 of the Bill deals with the assessment of applications for international protection and consists of sections 26 to 32, inclusive.  Section 30, for example, provides that protection against persecution or serious harm can only be provided by a state or parties controlling a state or part of a state, provided they are willing and able to offer protection which is effective and of a non-temporary nature.  There are various definitions dealt with in that section.<\/p><p>Part 5 of the Bill deals with the examination of applications for international protection at first instance.  Section 33 provides for the examination of an applicant by an authorised officer to determine first if the applicant should be given a refugee declaration, and, if not, if the applicant should be given a subsidiary protection declaration.  Section 34 provides that as part of the examination the applicant shall be subject to a personal interview.  That is an important section.  The various guarantees applicable to unaccompanied minors are set out, including that the interview is conducted by a person who has the necessary knowledge of the special needs of minors.<\/p><p>Part 6 of the Bill deals with appeals to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal and consists of sections 40 to 45, inclusive.  These provisions are in compliance with the EU directive on asylum procedures.  Section 40 provides that an appeal may be brought by notice in writing within 15 days of the sending of the notification of the recommendation at first instance to either refuse refugee status or to refuse both refugee status and subsidiary protection.  There is also the possibility of the tribunal holding an oral hearing for the purpose of an appeal.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Bill deals with the various outcomes for applicants for international protection.  These provisions represent the watershed of the new applications procedure.  In summary, in respect of an application for international protection which is admissible for processing in Ireland and is not subsequently withdrawn, the applicant concerned can have one of the following outcomes: refugee status, subsidiary protection status, permission to remain in the State, voluntary return to the country of origin or deportation order.<\/p><p>Section 46 provides for the giving of, and the refusal to give, a declaration of refugee status or subsidiary protection status.  On the other hand, section 47 allows for voluntarily return to the country of origin.<\/p><p>Section 48 provides that the Minister shall, in the case of an applicant who is being refused international protection, consider whether the applicant should be given permission to remain in the State and provides that in making this decision the Minister shall have regard to the applicant's family and personal circumstances and his or her right to respect for his or her private and family life.  This makes it clear that the Minister, in making a decision, shall have regard to the provisions of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>Section 49 provides for the prohibition of return based on the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Section 50 provides for the making of a deportation order.  Section 51 provides a procedure for the revocation of international protection status, principally where the person is excluded from, or has ceased to be eligible for, international protection.<\/p><p>Part 8 of the Bill deals with international protection aspects and consists of sections 52 to 57, inclusive.<\/p><p>Part 9 of the Bill provides for matters relating to programme refugees and temporary protection of displaced persons.  Section 58, for example, provides for the admission to the State of persons for resettlement, which is usually in co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.<\/p><p>Part 10 of the Bill deals with the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, Part 11 deals with transitional provisions which will be necessary and Part 12 deals with more miscellaneous matters.<\/p><p>On Part 13, as intended by this Bill, an effective immigration and asylum system must ensure that those entitled to a positive decision receive it as soon as possible.  At the same time, we must also provide effective safeguards for removing those without the sustainable grounds for remaining in Ireland.  The amendments found in this part of the Bill therefore address, among other matters, a number of gaps in existing legislation in the area of deportation that have been identified in court proceedings.<\/p><p>In concluding the introduction of this Bill before the Seanad, I consider that it can simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and will also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time applicants spend in the direct provision system.  At the same time, it will allow for the identification, at a much earlier stage, of persons who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their engagement with this important legislation.  There is much more work to be done in terms of broader migration policy, but this evening's Bill represents an important step forward in streamlining the asylum and protection provisions which will ensure the dignity of all concerned.  In that spirit, I look forward to the debate of its provisions and the reforms which it can put in place.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#YY00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for bringing forward legislation here this evening.<\/p> <p>At the beginning, if I would make one appeal on this legislation it would be that when we come to Committee Stage we might approach it in a flexible way because it is a complex issue which to some extent is changing day by day.  As we watched the television pictures in recent times of the movement of refugees, it was, to say the least, a most shocking spectacle.  Particularly when one looks at the children who were involved in those cases, one gets the sense that one wants to do something substantial to make our contribution.  We should not in any way try to shirk the responsibility we should feel.  In fact, it is in our tradition.  It is expected of us that we would be to the fore when it comes to humanitarian policies.  That is the way we should approach this legislation.<\/p> <p>We have much to learn from the system as existed heretofore and while there may be some good aspects to it, often under the radar there were matters that we should not feel to happy about.  Unfortunately, for those who found themselves in inadequate situations, they tend to stay silent to some extent lest they might in some way endanger their immigration prospects.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1968\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1968&amp;amp;pid=LabhrasOMurchu&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is understandable.  It is like people going to America without proper documentation.  Often they are wary and cannot look for their rights.  To some extent they are in a hiatus while that is happening.  In our particular case, those of us who were able to experience aspects of it could see some of the difficulties for people who were waiting for a long time to be processed and to have their cases concluded.  It is possible that was allowed to continue for too long and it created, again under the radar, a degree of anger and dissatisfaction.  When there is anger and dissatisfaction, people in that position may feel they are not respected members of society.  That is the worst thing that can happen in such a case.  Children have to be central to this legislation because they are always in the front line of suffering when issues like this arise.  I am not just talking about the stream of thousands of people we saw on the move but even those in localities as well.  We need to be careful not to treat those children differently from the way we would treat our own children in Ireland.  We must respect certain aspects of their privacy and of their security and that must form a central part of the Bill.<\/p><p>I hope the issue of family reunification will be looked at closely because I believe the majority of refugees want to be reunited with their families.  To be ostracised from one's own family as a result of force, having been ostracised from one's own community and country, is very worrying.  The headings in the Bill are right.  What are the rights that should be considered?  The fear of execution and so on is included.  Nobody is suggesting that the floodgates should be opened without thinking in terms of our own national security as well.<\/p><p>I spoke yesterday in the House on the issue of what is happening in the Middle East and the concept of war taking over from diplomacy and dialogue.  One of the reasons there are huge numbers of people on the move is because of what is happening in places such as Syria.  I have grave doubts about bombing campaigns helping that situation.  It will disrupt normal life, bring about killings and spawn a whole new generation of terrorists who in turn will drive ordinary people from their own countries.  We all know that Europe in particular was not prepared for the movement that took place.  It was clear that the European Union and its structures did not foresee the tsunami of people on the move which hit it.  We still have not corrected that.  Each state was asked to make a contribution.<\/p><p>This legislation provides precisely for us to deal with this issue in great detail.  In dealing with it, we have to see how the people who come here will be helped to integrate into the new country of their adoption.  That is particularly important.  They have to be helped to integrate.  I know many organisations doing great work in interacting with the new immigrants.  They respect their culture, customs, religion and so on.  All those issues have to be a part of it.  I am not saying that can be provided for in legislation but the legislation should facilitate it because that will be vital for those people.  We must bear in mind that those people must feel welcome in the community of their adoption.  While we often hear some negative comments, by and large the comments have been compassionate, positive and constructive.  We must encourage that whether through legislation or through other policies or resources.  It is important to do that.<\/p><p>I often think of the people who emigrated to America in the 1950s and earlier who were met with signs saying \"No Irish need apply\".  That did happen and the photographic evidence of it exists.  Some even went further than that and said \"No Irish or dogs admitted\".  That is how serious it was.  That is our history and we must ensure that does not happen again.<\/p><p>Some deportation cases of which we have heard have been heartbreaking.  I accept that being on the outside and without knowing all the detail, we are just guessing the background, but I saw cases of people who had integrated into the local society, their children were going to schools, they were highly respected and members of organisations and yet were set up for deportation.  Even if I put forward only one case, there have been many others.  Those cases should never be allowed to exist in future.  There has to be a clear-cut methodology and we have to spell out the deportation process or voluntary return to the homeland.  I think especially of deportation because while organisations can do a good job in ensuring a case is well put and people are defended, protected and have their rights looked after, many deportations have taken place in the middle of the night which I do not think is fair.  If there is a possibility, as those people have said, that their lives would be in danger if they went back home, it is important we have a way of finding out how that is the case.  It is not a matter of a simple registration when they come here.  Often it is not easy to get that information from countries where there is turbulence and civil war.  Can one imagine sending a mother with two or three children back to such a situation?  When they go back one hears no more about them.  Is it possible they would suffer, be tortured or even killed?  Nothing should surprise us, given the depravity of ISIS and what it is capable of doing.  The worst feature is that there are various factions in Syria and other places acting like warlords, all looking after territorial issues.  There is no central consolidating feature.  They are not like us with a democratic structure and a justice system and a methodology of having one's case heard.  We need to be very sensitive in this area.<\/p><p>Being aware of the Minister's compassion in these areas, it would be great if we had a more fluid approach to Committee Stage in order that what comes out at the end of it might take on board all the potential dangers of people not being treated as proper human beings and not having their rights protected and vindicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister who has been a regular visitor this week.

I hope no one in this society would defend the current system of direct provision where people are within a structure or system for up to nine or ten years.  Often, the reason is that people are appealing decisions that do not grant them permission to stay.  Nevertheless, our society, community and people would not approve of a system, whatever the appeal mechanisms, whereby someone is left in limbo awaiting a final decision for such a length of time.<\/p><p>This Bill makes a real effort to address these concerns.  The 26 recommendations reflected in the body of the Bill are welcome.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is the director general of one of our greatest organisations that has branches throughout the world.  The organisation has embraced and looked after our emigrants.  When they have found themselves in difficulty, they have been able to relate to music and a community in exile that is built around our greatest tradition, that is, music, as well as Gaelic games.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is well-equipped to speak on this issue and to point out to us what our responsibilities should be.  Some of the stories of posters declaring \"No dogs, no Irish\" did not only appear in America or faraway countries.  They were in some European countries as well, even including our nearest neighbours.  We must not behave like that in any way.  I heard a father being interviewed on the \"Ryan Tubridy Show\" this morning.  His child was on the \"Late Late Toy Show\".  They had to put up with some horrendous racial abuse.  The child is six years of age.  Our society has matured in many ways.  Anyway, those with a clear responsibility for making manifest the difference between right and wrong must ensure that right always wins out.<\/p><p>This Bill puts right many wrongs.  I sincerely hope it passes through the House without delay.  It is an absolute priority that this is signed into law as quickly as possible.  I understand the point about taking a fluid approach to Committee Stage.  However, I put it to the Minister that we cannot delay this in any way.  It is not the panacea to resolve all our problems, but it is a significant step in the right direction.  I believe it is probably the most ground-breaking legislation in this area in recent history.

I am cognisant of what we are trying to do today.  It is complex.  It has been difficult for Members and the civil society organisations specialising in the areas of refugees, asylum and children's rights issues - from whom many Members, including myself, seek guidance and advice in advance of parliamentary debates - to analyse the intricacies of this Bill in the time that has been given to us.  On the other hand, I appreciate the effort on the part of the Government to bring this important Bill to fruition before the Christmas recess.<\/p> <p>I intend to focus my intervention and my engagement on this Bill to issues relevant to children and children's rights, because I believe this is the area where I can add my expertise.  In this regard, I thank the Children's Rights Alliance for its support in helping me to understand the complexities of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Article 22 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges Ireland to ensure that children seeking or holding refugee status, whether unaccompanied or not, should receive appropriate protection and assistance in the enjoyment of the rights of the convention and other applicable human rights treaties.  The State is further obliged to assist a child in the tracing of his or her family and in obtaining information relevant for reunification.  In circumstances where the child's family cannot be found, the child is entitled to the same protections as other children deprived of their families under the convention.<\/p> <p>In 2006, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child called on the State to \"take necessary measures to bring [its immigration] policy, procedures and practice into line with its international obligations, as well as principles outlined in other documents, including the Statement of Good Practices produced by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Save the Children\".  As the Minister is well aware, Ireland will be examined before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 2016, in other words, in a few weeks' time.  It would be very disappointing if the provisions for children in this Bill were found by the committee to be wanting in respect of our convention obligations.  My concern in this regard is further heightened by the fact that the key recommendations of the working group on direct provision in respect of children are not implemented in this Bill.  It is disappointing that there have been no positive reforms for the 1,600 children currently in the direct provision system - they are the most vulnerable group of asylum seekers - despite a HIQA report in May 2015 identifying serious child welfare and protection concerns in a number of children and family services areas.<\/p> <p>I realise it is outside the scope of this Bill, but the Minister knows of my view on the importance of having an independent complaints mechanism similar to that afforded to the Ombudsman for Children.  I have raised the issue with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs as well.<\/p> <p>I am also concerned about payments, particularly payments to children.  They have not changed in 15 years.  At the least, the payments should be brought in line with the qualified child increase as referenced in the working group report.  I imagine that is a decision for the Minister for Social Protection but perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality could advise the Seanad on the matter.<\/p> <p>I welcome the provision in the Bill for the new single application procedure to streamline and speed up the application process.  It is long overdue.  Even ten years ago people were talking about the establishment of an independent protection appeals tribunal and the inclusion of child-specific forms of persecution as grounds for protection.  These are referenced in section 7(2).<\/p> <p>One substantive area I have difficulty with relates to the notion of the best interests of children and how this is dealt with in the Bill.  I thank the Minister and her officials for their engagement in the past 24 hours to try to see how we can strengthen the relevant provisions and work together.  Let us consider the provisions relating to the best interests of the child in Irish legislation.  It was the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, who, during her previous role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs at the time of the passage of the Child and Family Agency Bill as well as recently with the Children and Family Relationships Bill, put the key provisions relating to the best interests of the child into Irish law.  I am keen to ensure we progress that legacy with this Bill.<\/p> <p>Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as it relates to the best interests of the child is clear.  My difficulty is that the Bill only refers to the best interests of the child in a limited way, for example, in cases where international protection has been granted upon recognition of a child's status in the application of a medical examination to determine the age of an unaccompanied minor or in certain aspects of the conduct of protection interviews for unaccompanied minors.  The working group report recommendation stated that the International Protection Bill 2015 should reflect the general principle contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the effect that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children.<\/p> <p>I submitted an amendment yesterday, but I have since redrafted it to ensure that in introducing the idea of the best interests of the child as the primary consideration, nothing in this legislation shall affect any provisions that are more conducive to the realisation of the rights of the child contained in other enactments or international law.  For example, the European Court of Human Rights has asserted the importance of the child's best interests.  It also stressed the importance of reuniting the child with his or her family unless it is not in the child's best interests.  I have submitted an amendment to ensure that the best interest principle is subject to the obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p> <p>Another area I have concerns over relates to training for authorised officers on children's rights.  The working group report made clear that there should be a provision requiring decision-makers who take decisions in respect of children and those who interview children have received appropriate procedural and substantive training.  This could be specific training on children's rights and certified qualifications in interviewing children.  Perhaps that is something the Minister could address.  I have not tabled an amendment on the matter at this point but I will do so on Report Stage if I believe it is not being dealt with.  Section 34(8) relates to how personal interviews by authorised officers may be dispensed with where the applicant is under the age of 18 years and he or she is of such an age and degree of maturity that an interview would not usefully advance the examination.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Will the Minister to look at the Children and Family Relationships Act which includes the provision for a court to appoint an expert to determine and convey a child's view?  I agree with the recommendation by the Children's Rights Alliance that the Bill should include a provision that section 34(8)(b) can only be exercised upon the appointment of an expert on the views of children.  Perhaps that is something we can look at.<\/p><p>Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is very clear on the issue of child detention: \"The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time\".  It was of great concern to me when I read section 20(1)(c) in conjunction with section 20(7).  The latter provides that a child under 18 years can be detained as an adult if there are reasonable grounds for believing the person is not under 18 years.  I believe this is a breach of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's general comment No. 6 which provides that in cases of uncertainty as to the individual's age, the individual should be given the benefit of the doubt and should be considered a child.  I realise that the Bill's provision has been inserted to protect a Garda who, using reasonable presumption, makes such a decision.  In response, I have submitted an amendment that I hope will provide protection for children's rights and provide balance.  I thank my group colleagues, Senators Fiach Mac Conghail, Marie-Louise O'Donnell, Averil Power, Katherine Zappone and Mary Ann O'Brien, who have supported the two amendments I have tabled for Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#BBB00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and the introduction of the International Protection Bill 2015.  Others have spoken about the timing of the introduction of the Bill.  It is unfortunate that every year, and it seems to be a fact of life in the legislative calendar, we rush legislation at the end of the year and the calendar becomes overcrowded.  It is unfortunate this year, in particular, that we have so many Bills to get through in a limited time.<\/p> <p>Having said that, this is a Bill that is long overdue and that needs to be passed.  It has been broadly welcomed in principle by NGOs working in the area.  I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of Sue Conlan of the Irish Refugee Council.  It is reform that is very necessary which has been acknowledged by everyone.  As the Minister has said, this Bill is not the final step in reform of our immigration and international protection process.  Clearly, there is a great deal more to be done by way of reform and this is an important first step.  We are all conscious of the lengthy legislative history of this Bill and that it represents part of much bigger legislation that was at an advanced stage previously.<\/p> <p>The aim of the Bill is to reduce the length of time an asylum applicant will spend in direct provision through establishing a single applications procedure.  There is a good deal more in the Bill but clearly a reduction in time is a clear aim or goal which we all welcome.  We also welcome that it replaces what is a cumbersome and unwieldy framework for applications under the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.  We are all cognisant of the need to ensure we underpin our commitments both nationally and at European level to deal with the migration crisis.  All of us in this House have spoken about the dreadful plight of the desperate refugees we have seen in recent months fleeing Syria and Iraq in large numbers and at such terrible cost to themselves.  We have also seen the dreadful deaths in the Mediterranean Sea.  We are all very conscious, therefore, of the need for reform.  The flaws in the current process have been well documented but I will say again that delay is a major issue.  Anyone who is familiar with direct provision or has been critical of it has identified delays as a key issue.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the Bill has linked with the work done in this area by the working group on the protection process.  As the Minister said, the legislation responds to the 26 recommendations made by the group.  I commend my Labour Party colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who has been instrumental in seeking to achieve progress on the recommendations of the group.  A key critique by NGOs which work in the area and whose input has been very helpful is that the Bill does not go far enough in implementing the recommendations of the working group.  I hope we will see more progress on the other recommendations in due course.<\/p> <p>As the Minister has said, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality compiled an interim report on the Bill at the pre-legislative stage back in July.  The benefits of the Bill are obvious.  It will bring our law more closely into line with our EU obligations and with the United Nations' convention on refugees.  It will provide a co-ordinated framework and replace what is a fragmented system, which is welcome.  The Bill will also tackle the issue of delay and provide a speedier and more efficient process, which is why, as I said, NGOs have broadly welcomed the Bill in principle and its introduction.<\/p> <p>There have been quite a number of critiques of the Bill.  I will identify some of the issues that have been flagged with us by groups such as the Irish Refugee Council, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, NASC and the Law Society of Ireland.  It may be, given the limited time available, that we cannot see a way to change the Bill to respond to all the concerns.  It is important to put them on the record and to look at how we can address them in future legislation or other policy mechanisms.<\/p> <p>The recommendations made by the working group on the protection process should be implemented although that need not necessarily be done through statute or this Bill.  There should be more progress made on the other recommendations.  Many groups have argued that the system of reception should have a statutory basis.  There is a concern about statelessness which I know is something that has been worked on for some time.<\/p> <p>Senator van Turnhout has raised issues about the adequacy of the protection of children's rights in the Bill as formulated, and concerns have also been expressed in this regard as it affects other groups.  I note that the Law Society of Ireland, NASC and the Irish Refugee Council have referred to the difficulties with refugee family reunification.  I know from speaking to colleagues who practise in this area that there is a great deal of litigation before the courts in respect of this area.  It is very important, therefore, that we get the legislation right.<\/p> <p>There is a concern that the definition of family in the Bill is too limited.  There is also a concern that the time limits and procedures provided for may not adequately address people's need to be reunited with their families.  There is also an issue with access to work for refugees or, should I say, for those in the system.  I mean people seeking asylum and who have been in the system for a period such as six months.  I note that section 16 states such persons are precluded from seeking work.  Again, we should be able to look at the matter.  Perhaps in other legislation we should look at how best to meet the needs of people to ensure they are not stuck in a system unable to work for lengthy periods.<\/p> <p>I am conscious of the timing of this legislation in terms of the amount of legislation and business we must get through.  I welcome this Bill as a first step in the much-needed reform of our international protection process.  I thank the Minister for introducing the legislation in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#CCC00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Even though I have some grave reservations about some of the issues in the Bill, I still welcome the thrust of it.  I concur with Senator Bacik that the Oireachtas seems to have a problem, and it does not just apply to the Government, because each year as we approach Christmas, and particularly as we reach the end of the Government's term, legislation is rushed through.  As always, rushed legislation is not good legislation.  I have only seven minutes to contribute so I will concentrate on two areas - separated children and the question of translation and interpretation.<\/p> <p>Section 57(2) states that with regard to the relevant provisions of the rest of Part 8, \"Content of international protection,\" the best interests of the child \"shall be a primary consideration\".  I submit that the best interests principle should be fully enshrined in the legislation and that the definition of a separated child, as prescribed in the Separated Children in Europe Programme's statement of good practice, should be laid down in the primary legislation.<\/p> <p>Clear and objective procedures on the assessment of the age of a child on arrival in the State should be laid down in primary legislation.  Provision should also be made for this assessment to be made by appropriate and trained personnel.  Currently, there is no statutory procedure for age assessment.  This decision-making power must be exercised in accordance with the principles of constitutional justice and fair procedures and should include the right of review.  Such principles require certain minimum statutory safeguards.<\/p> <p>Section 24 is on the medical examination to determine the age of an unaccompanied minor.  The section does not provide guidance on what factors a medical examination should take into account and the qualifications such a medical examiner should hold.  In accordance with the UNHCR guidelines on best practice, there should be provision for the physical, developmental, psychological, environmental and cultural attributes of the child to be examined by independent professionals with appropriate expertise and familiarity with the child's ethnic and cultural background.  Examinations should never be forced or culturally inappropriate.  Particular care should be taken that the examinations are gender appropriate.  The current proposals vest powers in the immigration officer with potentially serious consequences.  For example, the power to detain could lead to the consequential detention of a minor as a result of a flawed age assessment.  Immigration officers should be trained to recognise children at risk at the point of entry and to make decisions that are in the best interests of the child.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Denis O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1988\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The proposed legislation should lay down clear and objective guidance on the assessment of the responsible adult for a separated child.  In law, a child is either accompanied by a guardian or is a separated child - there is no in between.  If the child is a separated child, it should be referred to the Child and Family Agency.  The current proposals allow for the use of a responsible adult - see Part 3, which concerns applications for international protection - a term which may not protect the interests of the child and does not accord with Irish law, and the purpose of which is unclear.<\/p><p>On the question of translation and interpretation, some but not all of this material was passed on to me by the Law Society committee which wanted to examine this matter.  They wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member.  They make a big issue of the translation and interpretation set-up.  Given the huge importance of evidence on protection and leave to remain claims, particularly in the context of the credibility assessment of an applicant - where in most cases such evidence is the deciding factor - it is essential that competent interpreters and translators are provided at all stages of the process.  There is no legislation regulating translators and interpreters in Ireland, nor is there any national professional qualification on foot of a statute, or a practised direction from the courts.  Translation and interpreting are unregulated in Ireland, which means that anyone who speaks English and another language can call him- or herself a translator or interpreter.  I think that is not good enough.  It is a flaw in the legislation.  <\/p><p>I understand that practitioners in this area also have concerns about the quality of the interpretation and translation services available at each stage of the protection application process.  It is the Law Society committee's view that the interpreters' and translators' professions should be regulated by the State to ensure that adequate interpreters are provided and that the minimum standards are discussed, defined and enforced in this regard. <\/p><p>This is not an innocuous area.  In a situation in which a misunderstanding arises because an interpreter does not collate and pass on precise information, a simple misinterpretation could prove to be a serious injustice to the person seeking help.  It is absolutely crucial that qualified and regulated interpretation and translation services be provided at every stage of the international protection application system.  Such services are essential in ensuring that there is effective and clear communication with all applicants at all stages of the process.<\/p><p>Section 18, \"Statement to be given to applicant,\" refers to the Minister providing the person with a statement in writing - specifying in a language that the applicant may reasonably be supposed to understand - of the procedure to be followed and of his or her rights and obligations.  The emphasis should be on the importance of ensuring that there is effective communication, and that the communication is in a language and form - depending on the levels of literacy of the person involved - which the person can reasonably understand.  The people currently involved in interpretation are concerned about the quality and status of this particular area.<\/p><p>Section 34 refers to personal interviews.  This raises a further matter of serious concern regarding the requisite standards of interpretation in the application process.  Section 34(4) states that the Minister's only obligation in this regard is to ensure that the interpreter speaks a language that the applicant may reasonably be supposed to understand and in which he or she is able to communicate.  That falls far short of what we require here, because a person can be turned out of the State on a misinterpretation or misunderstanding.  In its submission on this Bill, the Law Society's committee considered that this minimum threshold does not hold the application process to sufficiently high standards.  A more practical and effective test would be, at the very least, that both the applicant and interpreter ought to be able to understand and clearly communicate with one another without misinterpretation.  <\/p><p>I intend to table amendments on Committee Stage.  Broadly, our party welcomes this legislation, but I regret that it is all being pushed and rushed through in the final weeks before the Christmas recess.  I suppose the Minister has to deal with the hand that is dealt to her and I can understand the problems she has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#CCC00300","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#DDD00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>It is not a personal thing but it frustrates us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#DDD00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I will be brief, because I know that we have a long night ahead of us again.  The Minister will have to take up residence in this House.  I welcome the Bill, which is another piece of reforming legislation from the Minister, among others that she has introduced since coming into Government.  The Government gave an undertaking to reduce the length of time for completion of the asylum seeking process.  Heretofore, that delay was one of the main criticisms of conditions involved in the process.<\/p> <p>We may not have sufficient time to debate this reforming Bill, but I know that the Minister and her staff have put much time and effort into its preparation.  I want to concentrate on a couple of aspects of the Bill, particularly section 7.  I welcome the inclusion of sexual violence and gender-based violence, which may amount to acts of persecution.  In its submission, the Immigrant Council of Ireland stated that domestic violence should also be specifically named in the Bill, but as currently drafted it is not.  That would provide clarity to women that they may apply on those grounds also.  We have seen the problems associated with domestic violence both here and abroad.<\/p> <p>That recommendation was also supported by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in its interim report.  If that were done it would be welcome.  I suggest that a change be made to the charging rules of the Director of Public Prosecution, because everything concerning domestic violence has to be referred back to this office.  A Garda at the rank of inspector or higher should give direction to charge in cases of domestic violence.  I am mentioning that issue in the context of this Bill, although it could not be included in the legislation before us.  <\/p> <p>Section 24 should include a definition for an unaccompanied minor.  In addition, we must ascertain who is accompanying that minor.  The relationship is important, because the person accompanying a minor into this country could be a trafficker.  A recent television programme on sexual violence and prostitution showed young girls coming in from Romania, Bulgaria and elsewhere.  They were being trafficked into this country and they cannot say \"boo.\"   <\/p> <p>That brings me to the element of training authorised officers.  If a person does not have specific training in how to recognise or analyse the adult, child or unaccompanied minor involved, then specialised training is required.  An unaccompanied minor will not be able to say what is going on, although I know that individual interviews occur.  The child's rights should be protected in cases of trafficked minors, whether unaccompanied or accompanied by an adult.  Senator Van Turnhout spoke about how the rights of the child are identified.  Sections 24, 35 and 52 to 56, inclusive, contain references to the best interests of and the rights of the child.  However, the whole Bill should be child-proofed in every section.  The definition of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should also be part of the Bill, as should the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  <\/p> <p>Senator Van Turnhout quoted from the submission on the Bill made by the Children's Rights Alliance, which contains so many good recommendations.  Many of them are contained in the Bill, but others could be inserted also.  As Senator Van Turnhout said, primary consideration should be given to the rights of the child. <\/p> <p>The role of the Ombudsman for Children is important, as are the qualifications of the authorised officers and their relationship in the context of the complaints mechanism.  These things should be incorporated into the Bill.  All interviewing officers should be properly trained to deal with children as well as identifying women who are victims of sexual and gender-based violence.  Such officers must receive specific training and support in that regard.  <\/p> <p>I will revert to the issue of domestic violence later, but it is one that I would like to see defined and strengthened in the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on her introduction of this Bill, which has been awaited for ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#DDD00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

We welcome a single application procedure but not an application procedure that ignores basic safeguards and ignores the rights of children.  It is claimed that this legislation will create an efficient procedure for the processing of applicants for international protection.  However, efficient procedures require a depth of thought and consideration that are completely absent from this Bill.  Further, the democratic procedures required for effective scrutiny are being ignored in terms of the speed with which this Bill is being presented to the House and the disregard that has been shown to the organisations that submitted their considered opinions to the joint committee, and to the recommendations of the Government's own working group on the protection process, the report of which was published on 30 June 2015.<\/p> <p>At best, this Bill is a work of incompetence.  A cynic might say that it is not a matter of incompetence but, rather, a complete disregard for those who are weakest in Irish society since there are no votes affected in the Fine Gael constituency in respect of these matters.  Where, then, is the influence of the Labour Party on the Bill?  By agreeing to this legislation, Labour has done a complete disservice to the weakest members of this society.  It is astounding that the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is lending his legitimacy to it.  Let us examine the Labour Party's claims.  On the party's website it states, \"Labour is the only party of social change.\"  Despite the absolute vacuity of that statement, with this Bill Labour can say it is indeed a party of social change, a change in this Bill which represents a rolling back of previous protections provided in the Asylum Act of 1996 and a rolling back of ensuring those weakest in society are afforded basic and humane protections.  It is certainly social change to render the inviolability of the home null and void.<\/p> <p>The Labour Party also claims that \"Labour has changed Ireland for the better, and has made our country a more modern, equal, and progressive place for everybody.\"  This is hypocrisy.  Is modernity reflected in the intrusive medical examinations on children, absent their consent, that are facilitated in this Bill?  Is equality reflected in the fact that victims of domestic violence are equally fearful of reporting violence inflicted by their partners in case it removes them from basic legal protections and opens up the appalling possibility of deportation?  With regard to progressivity, in this Bill persons seeking protection are seeing a progressive removal of minimum humane standards of international law.<\/p> <p>In the statement of Government priorities for the period 2014 to 2016, the Government committed to treating asylum seekers with the humanity and respect they deserve.  In this Bill, we now indeed see what this Government thinks asylum seekers deserve.  They deserve to be treated arbitrarily by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  They deserve to be removed from their homes in the middle of the night.  They deserve to have their consent ignored and undergo an invasive medical examination.  They deserve to have the unity of their family life destroyed and negated.  These houses must be afforded the time needed to rectify these oversights and incorporate the expert opinions available to really make a difference to individual asylum seekers.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in stands in solidarity with the weakest in our society.  Sinn F&eacute;in concurs with the opinions expressed by the experts and the Irish Refugee Council, Nasc, Doras Luimn&iacute;, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, SPIRASI and Women's Aid, who have all conveyed their concerns to us.  I commend them on their work and recognise their input into this debate.  They are part of the wider democratic process and it is a pity the submissions they made on this Bill were not used to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of our legislative process.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be bringing forward a large number of amendments on Committee Stage in the hope that the Minister does the right thing.  I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, will use whatever influence he has to assist in the latter being achieved.<\/p> <p>There has been much talk about the recommendations of the working group and there has been approval for the fact that 26 of them have been taken on board but there were 170 recommendations.  Where are the rest of them and where are the key recommendations?  All Senators across the House need to reflect on how and how many times direct provision was referenced in the Minister's speech.  It is only referenced as a title of a report or in connection with the length of time people spend in direct provision.  I have asked the Minister on a number of occasions where she stands on direct provision.  Senators across this House have called for direct provision, as an institution, to be scrapped.  We have said that this institutionalised abuse needs to be ended forever as it is not tolerable but I do not see anything in this legislation that will get rid of direct provision or change it significantly.  All the Minister intends to do is reduce the amount of time people spend in direct provision.  That is totally unacceptable to me and it should be totally unacceptable to the other Senators across this House.<\/p> <p>Why have the opinions of the Ombudsman for Children and the Ombudsman, who has responsibility for oversight, not been taken on board?  Why have the opinions put forward by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions not been taken on board in this legislation?  People took part in the working group in good faith and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, made laudable statements regarding his opinions on direct provision and the asylum process through the working group.  My experience of working with people in direct provision is that they feel they have been conned, particularly those in the institution of direct provision who feel the system failed them and the process was merely a charade to kick things down the road.  They have no faith whatsoever in the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence in this regard.  What about the opinions on direct provision that were aired in these Houses?  The Minister should go back and read the debates we held on direct provision and look at what she said about it.  She said it should be scrapped so how come all those opinions have not been taken on board in this legislation?<\/p> <p>We have had an absolute farce in the past couple of days as regards another item of legislation from the Minister's Department and we see, again, that there are over 150 amendments from the Department on a Bill it has just presented.  That is totally unacceptable and this is obviously a ham-fisted piece of legislation.  It is not ready, it is half-baked and should be taken back.  I will oppose taking Committee Stage tomorrow morning because we need a proper debate on the amendments the Minister is putting forward.<\/p> <p>Other issues have been raised with us which need to be considered before the Bill is finalised and enacted, such as the absence of any reference to the reception of people seeking international protection, the lack of clarity around the training or powers of an immigration officer at the frontiers where interviews will be conducted and a lack of independent oversight.  Other issues are: the lack of any reference to the identification of vulnerable persons who may need greater assistance and care throughout the application process and the reception system; the lack of any gender-sensitive procedures and the absence of a particular reference to domestic violence as an act of persecution; the absence of any independent oversight of the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence in the carrying out of its obligations and duties; the very limited reference to the best interests of the child; the lack of a definition of an unaccompanied minor or a separated child; the inability of a child or young person to apply for international protection other than through an adult; the lack of independent legal advice for an unaccompanied child; and the inclusion of unaccompanied children in procedures which can lead to their application being deemed inadmissible, etc.  <\/p> <p>There are massive issues with this Bill and we will raise those issues on Committee Stage.  We want to see the single procedure coming forward but we cannot allow this Bill to be a Trojan horse that will leave those very vulnerable people who are seeking our aid and looking for our support at a time of huge strife in their lives in a worse position than that which they are in at present.  I fear that this is what the Bill will do and I say that in good faith.  We want to work with the Minister to make it a better Bill and to bring forward the single procedure.  However, we have massive concerns around the remainder of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#EEE00100","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on this important and much needed Bill, which has been called for over a very long period.  Broader migration reform is also needed but it was necessary to deal with these elements of policy at this point.  One of the most important goals of this Bill is an asylum system which deals promptly and effectively with those who make applications for international protection.<\/p> <p>It is important that we enact this legislation and I do not need to repeat the arguments here.  Most Senators, and society in general, will agree that we need a single application procedure as it has been a longstanding objective of ours to get into line with other European Union countries.  I am conscious of the working group report and we have had a number of meetings with the people involved in it since its publication.  It has been discussed a number of times in the Cabinet sub-committee and various issues are being progressed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, is making progress on various matters, including that of people in direct provision who have been deemed to be refugees and who are in need of housing, information and support.  He has done very valuable work with those involved in the system of direct provision and has produced and is producing some very helpful literature for people.<\/p><p>The working group proposals are to be discussed by the Cabinet committee on social policy next week.  Many of the matters will be further progressed.  In fact, progress has already been made, as those who know about the system will be very much aware.  The members of the working group, when we met them, acknowledged that many decisions have been taken on individual cases since the group reported.  People are well aware of that.  There is further work to be done on implementing the recommendations.  It was always understood that they could not be implemented overnight.  There are a number of key recommendations that the Minister of State and I regard as priorities on which to make progress.<\/p><p>The proposed protection office to be established in my Department will have the objective of giving each applicant for international protection a comprehensive and clear outcome at first instance regarding all aspects of his or her application, including both international protection and permission to remain on other grounds.  The efficiency and clarity that will be provided under these new arrangements will, contrary to what was suggested by some Senators, represent a significant improvement by comparison with the existing sequential system, which has effectively meant that people stayed in direct provision for long periods.  Although there have been criticisms of direct provision based on the standard of accommodation in some instances, as evident from the closure of a number of centres over the years, the primary criticism has concerned the fact that people are in the system for far too long.  It is unacceptable.  Staff working directly with people in the system state time and again that many of the problems with direct provision concern the length of time people spend in the system.  This Bill intends to, and will, bring us into line with other European countries.  This will mean we will have a far more efficient system without losing any of the important elements about which Senators spoke.<\/p><p>Why would we want to introduce a Bill that does not protect rights?  I have already spoken about how this Bill is coming from a human rights perspective and respects human rights, including children's rights, of course.  Undoubtedly, there is a debate to be had on how exactly one would transpose into legislation like this provisions on the best interests of the child, and on whether this matter is already dealt with effectively.  We must remember we now have a constitutional provision that puts the best interests and rights of the child very much to the centre.  It recognises the child as an individual.  All legislation is subject to this provision and will be interpreted accordingly.<\/p><p>There are very many positive aspects of the system that will not be lost.  An example is the experience of the members of staff who have worked in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  They are very experienced in examining applications for international protection and considering the granting of permission to remain, as we must acknowledge.  Senators have made comments about standards but all the staff have been trained to UNHCR standards.  That will continue to be the case.  I want to ensure the transition to the new arrangements is as smooth as possible and that the high standards pertaining to the quality of asylum decisions are maintained.  The international protection appeals tribunal will provide for the smooth transfer of the tribunal members who are currently examining cases.<\/p><p>I am very conscious of the needs of unaccompanied minors.  I carried out a study on them myself and met many of them some years ago at a time when they were being put into hostels around Dublin and were very vulnerable.  I am thankful their circumstances have changed.  We now have an excellent system under Tusla.  I am continually surprised by the experience of these young unaccompanied minors who end up in Dublin having come from all parts of the world.  There are far fewer than there used to be but, as I stated, they are a feature of some of the new migration patterns evident in the Mediterranean.  We must be very attentive to the needs of unaccompanied minors.  The approach now taken by Tusla is that they are placed in foster homes and carefully looked after.  That represents a massive change by comparison with the time when they were put into hostels when they arrived here.  They were incredibly vulnerable to traffickers or others who wanted to exploit them.  We have a very different set of circumstances now.  Of course I want to ensure that, in any legislation we introduce, unaccompanied minors will be dealt with carefully and sensitively and that their best interests will be considered.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators who have welcomed the Bill.  I certainly hope we can reassure them on some of the issues they raised when we proceed to Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#EEE00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":442,"content":"<p>V&oacute;t&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#GGG00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Will the Senators claiming a division please rise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#GGG00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Senators David Cullinane and Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":445,"content":"<p>As fewer than five Members have risen I declare the question carried.

The purpose of the patents of precedence provision in the Bill is to codify the process of becoming a senior counsel while also making it amenable to legal practitioners, whether barrister or solicitor, who have the requisite excellence in advocacy, specialist knowledge or special litigation.  The amendment is somewhat contradictory to what the Senator has been arguing.  To remove solicitors from the provision would defeat the opening up of this area of legal excellence to a significant cohort of persons who may have met the required standard.  Given that solicitors already have the right of audience before the courts and can become senior members of the Judiciary, that there are procedures for solicitors and barristers to switch professions, and that the two professions already work closely together, I am not sure why the Senator is proposing this deletion.  It seems contrary to the points he has been making about the need for more flexibility in the system.  It is incongruous with some of the other amendments the Senator has suggested.  Maybe I am missing something in the points he is making.  It is intended to open up the title of senior counsel to solicitors, and it is reflective of the changes and flexibilities that exist more and more between the two professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#NNN00900","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We have a new framework here.  We already have a series of Solicitors Acts in place.  The new legal services regulatory authority will change the various issues regarding solicitors and barristers, including how complaints are dealt with.  There will be a new regulatory framework and new oversight of financial management, and all the issues we have been discussing here.  We have taken great care with this group of amendments.  We were unable to do the work until we had the exact framework of the Bill in place.  Only at this point could we work out the detailed amendments needed to all the Solicitors Acts in order to incorporate what is in the Legal Services Regulation Bill.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What is being done in the entirety of this section is very technical.  It involves detailed drafting in respect of which we engaged a lot of expertise and on which we spent a great deal of time to ensure the technical amendments to the Solicitors Acts reflect accurately the work being done in the legal services regulatory authority, LSRA, and the implications it has for the practice of the profession of solicitor.  The series of amendments here is being made to the existing five Solicitors Acts.  In the longer term, what will be required is the consolidation of the Solicitors Acts, but that is a separate job.  For now, we suggest the range of amendments here in respect of the each of the Acts in place.  There is no policy change other than what we have been discussing throughout the course of the debate on the Bill.  This is merely about the transition into the Solicitors Acts of the LSRA and the implications it has for the Acts.<\/p><p>If I give an overview on the tabling of the amendments, it might be helpful to Senators.  The tabling of these Government amendments is intended to ensure all complaints about the conduct of legal practitioners who are solicitors will, from the date of commencement, be taken under the relevant procedures of the new legal services regulatory authority.  The amendments support the transitional arrangements for dealing with complaints already being dealt with under the Law Society's remit which will have to be completed by it under the existing regulations and processes.  They remove any existing powers of the Law Society in relation to solicitors which will now be conferred instead on the new regulatory authority.  They will ensure the existing powers and functions of the Law Society relating to the financial regulation of solicitors and to the solicitors' compensation fund are retained and firewalled.  They will make the Law Society subject to and compliant with the relevant provisions and regulations of the new Bill under the new legal services regulatory authority.  They will ensure relevant matters of misconduct can be amenable to the new legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal, whether they arise from public complaints made to the legal services regulatory authority or as a result of the Law Society's retained financial and accounts regulation work.  They will ensure that, when requested by the legal services regulatory authority, the Law Society will furnish the relevant investigating accountants reports in support of the handling of any public complaints relating to financial infringements.  They will also ensure no regulatory gap is created between the existing regulations that need to remain in place and those that may be introduced in the future under the new regulatory authority regime.<\/p><p>Senators can see from the foregoing that the changes we are making must be reflected in the Solicitors Acts.  These are the range of amendments, of which there are quite a few, to the five different Acts that must be made to ensure those Acts comply with the new regulatory authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#NNN01700","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Amendment

Given that the commission has recommended their introduction, I am very happy to go along with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#PPP03700","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":691,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 299:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":693,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 300:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 301.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":696,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 301:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":697,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p><p>Bill reported with amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":698,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 302:<\/p><p>In page 134, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:<\/p><p>&ldquo;<\/p><p>1954, No. 36       Solicitors Act 1954       Section 71(2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (10)<\/p><p>&rdquo;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":699,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 303:<\/p><p>In page 134, to delete line 7 and substitute the following:<\/p><p>&ldquo;<\/p><p>1994, No. 27       Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994       Sections 68 and 74<\/p><p>&rdquo;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":701,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":703,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#QQQ01350","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1449052200,"counter":704,"content":"<p>At 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015120200002#QQQ01375","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1449052200,"counter":705,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 December 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
