While the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets it is recognised that certain services such as maternity are demand led and require specialist staffing.  Arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of such staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement.<\/p><p>  The number of Staff Midwives, including the Senior Staff Grade, in the public health service at the end of 2013 was 1,341 (WTEs) - including 20 on the Graduate Placement Scheme.  The number at the end of 2007 was 933 (WTEs).  The December 2013 figure is noteworthy, as it shows the manner in which the HSE has the capacity to focus recruitment in specific areas where increases are required.  The number employed at the end of 2012 was 1,310 and at the end of 2010 the figure was 1,178.  As I have previously stated, the HSE examined the possibility of the State taking over Mount Carmel.

In addition, targeted funding of &euro;30m is provided to address areas of acute services which are likely to experience increased service demand, such as ED\/inpatient services\/day case procedures and outpatient services through the identification and utilisation of additional capacity and capability across the system.  This approach of monitoring activity levels, supported by consistent robust data collection and targeted intervention where necessary, has proven to be effective in 2013.  <\/p><p>  As regards outpatient services, the HSE Service Plan aims to reduce the ratio of new to return OPD attendances from 1 (new):2.6 (return) attendances in 2013 to 1:2 attendances in 2014.  This is best international practice and its achievement will be assisted by the work of the clinical programmes and the concentrated engagement of the SDU.  This, taken with the intense focus on OPD waits brought about by my initiatives in this area, will allow the HSE to reduce the actual number of OPD attendances overall whilst aiming to achieve the Government waiting list target.  All of these measures will enable the HSE to provide a flexible service to patients and will require co-operation from patients in maximising resources for all. <\/p><p>  In relation to in-patient and daycase activity, the planned activity levels presented in the HSE Service Plan for 2014 are 2% below projected outturn for 2013.  This is the maximum that could be planned for, given the resources that are available to the HSE which have to be balanced across all the services they provide.  Every effort will be used to deploy the &euro;30 million fund provided to address hospital service pressures as effectively as possible to achieve and surpass service plan activity targets. <\/p><p>  I have written to the HSE, asking them to manage waiting lists such that target waiting times are achieved by mid-year 2014 and maintained thereafter, rather than allowing waiting lists to escalate in the course of the year as has happened previously.  Finally, it is important to bear in mind that the requirement to provide treatment is not guided solely by waiting list targets, but rather by the requirement to effect necessary urgent or elective treatment in case of clinical need.  The ability to manage scheduled care waiting lists will also be effected by varying levels of unscheduled care activity and the resultant admissions which may result in prioritisation of emergency procedures over elective activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300051#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Prices","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300052#WRB00075"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[6929\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300052#WRB00100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he will be taking in 2014 to reverse the decline in the numbers with private health insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[6940\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300052#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his response to a Health Insurance Authority projection that the number of 18 to 29 year olds with health insurance will have fallen by almost 40,000 in March 2015 compared with July 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have been strongly seeking much greater cost control in the private health insurance industry and established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, comprising representatives from the private health insurance companies, my Department, and the Health Insurance Authority, to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  Last year, I appointed an independent Chairperson Mr. Pat McLoughlin, to work with my Department and the insurers under the auspices of the Forum on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market.  Mr. McLoughlin's first report was published on 26 December 2013, and the second phase of the review has commenced and will report within three months.  In particular it will study further the drivers behind rising costs in the PHI industry and seek to address them. <\/p><p>  I am supportive of the concept of Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) as a potential means of helping to address decreasing membership of the private health insurance market, in particular to provide an incentive for people to take out private health insurance at a younger age.  This is important as the health insurance market requires a sizeable cohort of younger members, who are generally healthier, to offset the high cost of older and less healthy members, which is critical to the sustainability of our system of community-rated health insurance.  My Department is working on proposals in this regard and will work, in conjunction with the Health Insurance Authority and industry stakeholders, to develop these further over the coming months.<\/p><p>  With regard to the provision of a universal healthcare system, intensive work is currently underway on the preparation of a <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance<\/i> which will provide more detail on the UHI model for Ireland, including the overall design of the model, the standard package of services, funding mechanisms and the key stages of the journey to UHI.

Last October, the Government approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption to the OECD average by 2020 (i.e. 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita per annum).  In 2011 the average per-capita pure alcohol consumption for everyone over the age of 15 was 11.63 litres in Ireland.<\/p><p>  A broad range of complementary measures is required to successfully reduce consumption of, and harms associated with, alcohol misuse.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  Its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption and is targeted in particular at harmful and hazardous drinking.  The Government also agreed that new low risk limits for alcohol consumption be introduced based on Irish standard drink of 10 grams of alcohol i.e 11 standard drinks or 112 grams of pure alcohol per week for women and 17 standard drinks or 168 grams of pure alcohol per week for men. <\/p><p>  Work is continuing in my Department on the development of a framework for the implementation of these measures.  A health impact assessment, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, was commissioned in 2013, as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.

Arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of front-line staff where there is an established service need.  More generally, in order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The ability of the public service to attract and retain high quality consultants shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required.<\/p><p>  If the health services are to continue to provide consultant-level opportunities for doctors to replace consultants who retire and eventually to expand overall capacity, this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model, hence the decision to reduce the pay of new consultants by 30%.  This decision is being modified to enable consultants currently working in permanent posts within the public service to move to different posts, while retaining their existing salaries.  Application of the revised guidance will support consultant mobility.  Allowing serving clinical consultants retain their existing salaries will remove a blockage on movement within the system at present.  This mobility will, in due course, also facilitate the roll-out of the Hospital Group model with staff appointed to the Group rather than being confined to specific locations. <\/p><p>  It is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service and there has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) over the past 5 years.  The number increased from 2,260 in December 2008 to 2,555 in December 2013.  However, the rate of increase has slowed over the past three years.  There are some specialties in which there is an international shortage and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale.  There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters due to the limited number of consultants.  The establishment of Hospital Groups will also help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources - instead of to just one hospital.<\/p><p>  I established the MacCraith Group last July to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures.

The deadline for applications was the 1st of February, however some flexibility will be given since the application process is in its first year.  The next stage in the process will be to identify and agree the supports required for each individual, identify the service providers who have the capacity to respond to those support needs, and agree the allocation of additional resources to support individual placements.  A communications process with all stakeholders will be put in place by the end of March, and young people and their parents will be advised of the placement which will be available to them by the end of June 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300053#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE National Service Plan","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300053#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[6917\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300053#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the divisional plans recently published by the Health Service Executive.

This body of work is in progress.<\/blockquote>  In relation to recruitment I would like to advise the Deputy that despite our falling birth rates, increased numbers of midwives have been employed in the health service.  The number of Staff Midwives employed at the end of 2010 was 1,178 (WTE's).  By the end of 2013, the number had increased to 1,341, including 20 recently qualified midwives participating in the Graduate Nursing\/Midwifery Programme.  This increase reflects the capacity of the HSE to appoint critical front-line staff where it is necessary to do so, notwithstanding overall recruitment constraints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300053#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Palliative Care for Children","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300053#WRC03550"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[6933\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300053#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will be providing paediatric care packages for children with life-limiting conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The report contains 31 recommendations which are being implemented under the aegis of the National Development Committee which is a multi-stakeholder representative group, chaired by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The national policy provides the framework for the development of services for children with life-limiting conditions and their families.  The policy places significant emphasis on supporting families and health care professionals to provide care for children in their own homes.<\/p><p>  A programme of care for children with life-limiting conditions is being jointly funded by the HSE and the Irish Hospice Foundation.  The programme includes the appointment in 2011 of the first Paediatric Consultant with a Special Interest in Palliative Care based in Crumlin.  As well as supporting other paediatricians, the Consultant also provides clinical support and advice to maternity hospitals and neonatologists.  The programme has also provided eight Children's Outreach Nurses whose role is to ensure that children being cared for at home by their families, have access to co-ordinated and supportive services.<\/p><p>  The nurses liaise closely with statutory and voluntary service providers including local GPs, Public Health Nurses, Disability Services, the Jack and Jill Foundation and LauraLynn's Children's Hospice etc.  An evaluation of the outreach nursing component of the Children's Palliative Care Programme is planned to take place this year.  This will provide information on how the programme is working to-date and provide pointers for future development.  The study will be undertaken on behalf of the Irish Hospice Foundation, the HSE and the Department of Health.<\/p><p>  Another aspect of the children's programme is the provision of structured education programmes for all health care staff who care for children with life-limiting conditions.  This is being delivered in partnership with Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin.  These programmes will help ensure that children and their families will have the necessary care and support provided to them, regardless of the location of that care.<\/p><p>  In the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014, the key priority in relation to children is to develop and integrate community based paediatric palliative care services.  In 2012, HSE regions spent approximately &euro;8.58 million on home nursing for children with life-limiting conditions.  However, it is widely acknowledged that because of how the financial system is set up, this figure did not capture all relevant expenditure and that the total spend was significantly higher.  It is also acknowledged that children with life-limiting conditions, and particularly children with palliative care needs, are prioritised within HSE regions.  Every effort is made to care for these children to the maximum extent possible, including home care for the children and their families.  <\/p><p>  In addition to this, the Palliative Care National Development Committee has commenced working on the development of a model for the provision of Hospice at Home care.  This is being carried out in partnership with current voluntary providers such as the Irish Hospice Foundation, LauraLynn's Children's Hospice and the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the budget for Palliative Care Services was &euro;72m.

Since then, over successive NPT and UNGA First Committee meetings, support for the statement has grown from 16 to 35 to 80 and, at the 2013 First Committee meeting of the UN General Assembly, to 125 states - a majority of UN members.  Ireland participated in the First International Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, hosted by the Norwegian Government in Oslo on 4 and 5 March 2013.  We will remain closely associated with this humanitarian initiative, as one of the original sixteen initiators of the joint statement.

","asker":"1063","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>The new Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it\u00a0also carries the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to the higher rate of income tax arises. However, the credit is more targeted, in that it\u00a0is in the first instance, only\u00a0available to the principal carer of the child. A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child or children is unsustainable.\u00a0The change follows\u00a0a recommendation from the Commission on Taxation\u00a0that the credit\u00a0should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. In order to qualify for the credit the principal carer cannot be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<\/p><p>  The principal carer is initially\u00a0being identified as the person who is receiving Child Benefit in respect of the child. Where, for whatever reason, a principal claimant who is entitled to the credit does not wish to avail of it, he or she can choose to surrender it to a secondary claimant. A secondary claimant may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year. The secondary claimant cannot be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case in question, the SPCCC has automatically been granted to the principal carer (i.e. the ex-spouse of the individual referred to in the Deputy's question).<\/p><p>  I should point out that there is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code. Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children. In certain cases, such couples also need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example.<\/p><p>  Legally enforceable maintenance payments made for the benefit of a separated or former spouse or civil partner are fully deductible for tax purposes in the hands of the payer and are treated as taxable income in the hands of the recipient. Alternatively separated spouses or separated civil partners may elect to continue to be jointly assessed in which case no regard is taken of the maintenance payment. <\/p><p>  Maintenance payments made for the benefit of children are not deductible for tax purposes. However, they are also not treated as income in the hands of the beneficiary. This is similar to the tax treatment of monies used by married couples for the maintenance of their children. Ultimately, child maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.<\/p><p>  In Budget 2012, in recognition of the difficulty some people have in meeting their mortgage commitments, I fulfilled a Programme for Government commitment to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008. This was the period during which house prices peaked. In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year. <\/p><p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300057#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300057#WRG01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300057#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[7300\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300057#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the actions he will take to deal with the call made to him by parents of the outreach classes in a school (details supplied) in Dublin 12 in respect of the proposed closure of this school with particular consequences for the two ASD classes; if he will appreciate the serious concerns of the parents and the community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>I can confirm for the Deputy that while my Department is aware of the Patron's proposals to merge three schools including the school to which he refers, I have not received any proposal from the Patron in the matter.

Where the applicant is a dependent student, the income of the applicant and his\/her parents must be taken into account in calculating whether the means are within the limits to be eligible for a grant.<\/p><p>  The Student Grant Scheme S.I. No 159 of 2013 makes provision in Article 21(3) which allows a dependent student to be exempted from having parents' income taken into account where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority that the dependent student is irreconcilably estranged from both of his or her parents and neither of his or her parents furnishes financial support to him or her.  This provision allows the awarding authority to assess dependent students, in genuine estrangement cases, without reference to their parents\/guardians income or address.  Cases of genuine estrangement are relatively rare and each one has unique circumstances.  The scheme does not stipulate precisely  how an awarding authority satisfies itself.  This is to allow the grant awarding authority sufficient flexibility to assess the evidence of irrevocable estrangement in each individual case. <\/p><p>  The assessment of a case of estrangement however has to be carefully considered to ensure there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exceptional circumstances pertaining in such cases genuinely exists.  The type of evidence required is dependent on the applicant's individual circumstances.  Compelling evidence of irreconcilable estrangement must be provided to allow a grant awarding authority to fully satisfy itself that the conditions for the application of exemption are met.  An awarding authority in assessing the evidence presented will have regard to the particular circumstances in each case and the corroborative nature of the evidence available to support the claim of estrangement.<\/p><p>  Different State support schemes have different objectives and in this case parents have a responsibility to support their children attending college.  Where they fail to do so, the grant awarding authority must satisfy itself that genuine and irreconcilable estrangement exists.  Confirmation that a student is living separately from his\/her parents\/guardians is not sufficient, as very significant numbers of third level students move out of the family home while at college and continue to be supported by their parents while in full-time education.  The purpose of the student grant scheme is to provide an additional assistance where parental income is below a certain threshold and warrants additional assistance by way of a grant.<\/p><p>  Evidence from services, including the Courts services and the Health Service Executive, working in a professional capacity with the family of the student, which demonstrates and confirms the genuine and irreconcilable nature of the estrangement would generally be necessary for an awarding authority to satisfy itself of the veracity of the case.  The appropriate officer(s) depends the individual's particular circumstances.  A letter from a GP would generally not be acceptable in isolation.  However, where a GP could demonstrate referring the student to relevant professional support services, the GP report could be considered in conjunction with a report from the specific support service utilised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300057#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[7210\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300058#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason married persons under 23 years of age who reside with their spouse in a separate home from their parents are still assessed on their parents' means for the purposes of Student Universal Support Ireland grant applications.

I wish to explain also that pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability\/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.<\/p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may therefore be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.  There is not currently a distinct disability category of Down syndrome for resource allocation purposes.  As such, it is not possible to advise of the number of children with Down syndrome who will be attending school for the 2013\/14 school year and accordingly my Department is not in a position to cost the inclusion of Down Syndrome as a low incidence disability.<\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down Syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. <\/p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  <\/p><p>The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.<\/p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. <\/p><p>  The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.

For the current school year, in order to meet growing demand from schools for low incidence special educational needs support, 480 additional new resource teaching posts were made available for schools, in order to maintain allocations at their current rate.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of these rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.  Requiring a company either foreign or domestic to employ a person or purchase goods or services from a specific geographical location would be against European Procurement rules and EU Treaty principles in relation to trade and the free movement of labour. <\/p><p>  The European Commission has issued guidance on this issue which stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives.  EU rules primarily envisage that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the tender notice or contract documentation and relate to the performance of the contract.  For example, EU rules state that contract performance conditions may, in certain circumstances, be intended to favour on-site vocational training; the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration; or, the protection of the environment.  In such cases this type of clause would have a relatively narrow application.<\/p><p>  In terms of impact, challenges arise from the need to ensure that:<blockquote>- value for money is not adversely affected;<br \/><br \/>- additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers (making indigenous suppliers less competitive and therefore be damaging in the long run);<br \/><br \/>- displacement is avoided (such a policy could adversely impact those currently employed); and,<br \/><br \/>- the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract. <\/blockquote>  Finally, it is important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad.  The public procurement market in the EU is valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion.  In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300059#WRJ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300059#WRJ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[7298\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300059#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to protect an area (details supplied) in County Wexford from further coastal erosion and flooding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The investigation and addressing of coastal erosion and flooding problems in Wexford, including the location referred to by the Deputy, are matters for Wexford County Council in the first instance.

The Supreme Court took the view that REAs were instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals.  While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution. <\/p><p>  The effect of this decision was to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act.  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law. <\/p><p>  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by Registered Employment Agreements were unaffected by the ruling.  Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.<\/p><p>  The striking down of the REAs means that new employees in these sectors can be hired at a rate agreeable between workers and their employers. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000.<\/p><p>  From the parties&rsquo; perspective, the primary objective of REAs was to provide them with a sense of certainty around terms and conditions that would apply when the employer is tendering for and working through contracts and to have in place agreed grievance and industrial peace provisions.  The agreements also had the effect of ensuring that the industry terms and conditions were recognised and maintained. In addition, the existence of these legally backed agreements was recognised under European Union law and ensured, in accordance with the Posted Workers Directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction, who may be using employees from lower wage economies, did not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.<\/p><p>  Having considered the legal advice from the Attorney General on the implications of the Supreme Court ruling, and given the importance of the issue for employers and their employees, particularly in relation to rates of pay and tendering for contracts, I undertook to bring forward legislation to address the ruling and to provide for a revised legislative framework that would be fully informed by the Supreme Court judgment and be expected to withstand constitutional challenge in the future. <\/p><p>  To this end, on 7 February last, a draft framework document was circulated to relevant stakeholders for consideration.  The new framework proposes a mechanism whereby, in contrast with the previous REA system which provided for employment agreements made between trade unions and employer representatives being given general application by means of a statutory order, groups substantially representative of workers and employers may jointly or separately request the Labour Court to undertake a review of the pay and\/or pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter. <\/p><p>  It is proposed that a trade union and\/or employer body that is substantially representative of workers or employers of such workers in a sector may make the application to the Labour Court to initiate the process.  Interested parties will be given an opportunity to make submissions to the Labour Court in the context of a review.<\/p><p>  The new legislation will provide the Labour Court with specific principles and policies that it will be obliged to take into account when considering whether to make and, if so, what recommendation to make to the Minister in relation to pay and\/or pension\/sick pay terms in a particular sector.  If satisfied, the Minister will give effect to the recommendation by Order.  The Order must then be laid before the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  In addition to the proposed new sectoral framework, it is proposed to reintroduce the facility for the registration of employment agreements to which there are only two parties i.e. individual employer and trade unions.  As such agreements are not legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, it is not considered necessary to provide for the same level of principles and policies that would apply in the case of agreements that would have sector-wide application.  Neither, for the same reasons, is it considered necessary for the registration of such agreements to be confirmed by Ministerial order.<\/p><p>  It is proposed to have discussions on the draft framework with relevant stakeholders shortly with a view to bringing proposals to Government as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300061#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300061#WRL00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300061#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[7219\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300061#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding community employment supervisors' entitlement to a pension scheme in view of the fact that the Labour Court recommended that F&Aacute;S implement a pension scheme in 2008 and some CE supervisors who have finished work still have no pension scheme in place.

In the absence of these measures, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments greatly in excess of their income from employment. For instance, while someone earning &euro;31.17 a week or more would have been liable for PRSI Class A contributions, the maximum personal rate of illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from January 1993 was &euro;70.60 a week, i.e. the social welfare benefits available could have been more than twice the level of income from employment for some people.<\/p><p>  To overcome the potential disincentives involved, new arrangements were introduced with effect from January 1993 to relate the rate of benefit payable to the level of the claimant's earnings. These measures must be regularly updated to keep pace with changes in benefit levels. Most recently, adjustments in Budget 2009 sought to bring the income threshold and banding structure back into line with the level of benefits payable.

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the recent severe weather conditions under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA). <\/p><p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  <\/p><p>  In addition to the payment of ENPs, SWA legislation also provides for assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment (UNP) which can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA.  The person may be required to pay the money back in respect of a UNP at a later date, for example, if the person had significant capital or income or was later compensated by an insurance company. <\/p><p>  A humanitarian assistance scheme was approved by Government in November 2009.  The scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair. The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme. Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. <\/p><p>  Total expenditure on the humanitarian assistance scheme to the end of 2013 was approximately &euro;2.2 million in respect of approximately 3,500 payments.  The statistics available show that payments issued ranged from approximately &euro;50 to &euro;28,000. <\/p><p>  In dealing with events of this nature the DSP generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:<\/p><p> - Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments for food, clothing, personal items and temporary accommodation in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially but this will increase as the extent of the problems become clearer.<\/p><p> - Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items. It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.<\/p><p> - Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental\/Agency response. Work carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring, painting etc.<\/p><p>  Any person who is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent weather events should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering SWA who may be able to offer assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300063#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Appeals","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300063#WRN00750"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[7459\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300063#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for one-parent family payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Building on this, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 reinforces the primacy of the elected council within the local government system, and provides a legislative basis for a stronger and more explicit statutory expression of the powers of elected members and the duty of the Manager to comply with policy as set down by the elected members, together with measures to strengthen the capacity generally of the elected council to oversee the business of the authority.<\/p><p>  The Act also provides for the replacement of the traditional County\/City Manager position by a new post of &quot;Chief Executive&quot;.   The change from manager to chief executive is an important aspect of clarifying, in a more modern sense, the appropriate roles of the executive in implementing the policy of the council , with the elected members acting as , in effect, the board of directors of the authority. In that context, elected members will have the power of decision over the appointment of the individual recommended by the Public Appointments Service for the chief executive post in their authority, while retaining the independence of the selection procedures of the Public Appointments Service.<\/p><p>  More importantly, the change to a chief executive post is accompanied by a range of significant provisions to give substance to the rebalancing of roles. For example, there are increased obligations on the chief executive to provide additional advice and assistance to elected members in the discharge of their roles at council and municipal district levels and in various committees. Chief executives will be obliged to have regard to the views of elected members while policy options are still in formation and will have to assist elected members in the development of new policies at an early stage of the policy formation process. Chief executives will also have to prepare monthly management reports for the elected members.<\/p><p>  The powers of the elected members in overseeing the implementation of policy by the chief executive are also being strengthened, including specific provision for oversight and superintendence of action taken pursuant to directions of the elected council. Where members are not satisfied with the chief executive's approach to implementation of their policy, they may request a report in which the chief executive must indicate what new or different actions may be pursued or other possible adjustment to the policy.<\/p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act also creates some important new reserved functions to be discharged by the elected members, including the adoption of integrated local economic and community development plans, and service delivery plans. The role of the elected members is also being strengthened in the context of the new system of municipal districts , including in the context of the draft local authority budgetary plan. <\/p><p>  The timing of the commencement of the various provisions outlined is currently being considered in the context of the timetable for commencement of provisions in the Act generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300065#WRP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":499,"content":"<p>Question No. 179 answered with Question No. 177.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Grant Payments","counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300065#WRP01850"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[7428\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300065#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on Parliamentary Question No. 220 of 19 December 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These changes were made on foot of the report of a review group, established last year by my Department, to examine the terms and conditions governing the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability.  Membership of the group included members of both the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority housing personnel and my Department. Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability.  The aim of the review was to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation.<\/p><p>  There has been no change to the maximum grant available under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability which remains at &euro;30,000 or the Mobility Aids Grant which remains at &euro;6,000. In the case of the Housing Aid for Older People, the maximum grant has been reduced from &euro;10,500 to &euro;8,000. The average grant paid under this scheme in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was &euro;4,162, &euro;4,106 and &euro;3,995 respectively, well below the maximum available. The age limit for eligibility has been increased from 60 to 66 years. However, a lower age limit may apply at the discretion of the local authority in certain cases.<\/p><p>  Changes have also been made with regard to the assessment of means of applicants. To bring it into line with the means assessment for applicants for social housing, all household member&rsquo;s income, with certain exceptions, will be included in the assessment of means. The level of income beyond which no grant is payable has been reduced from &euro;65,000 to &euro;60,000.  In the case of an applicant where a household member is aged under 65 there is no impact on grant eligibility.  However, where appropriate their income will be taken into account in accessing household income. <\/p><p>  I have increased the level of funding available for the grant schemes by 12% in 2014 to &euro;38.4 million.

It appears that the figures referred to by the Deputy may be those for one of the sub-categories of  'Fraud Offences', under the CSO classifications.  That category encompasses a wide variety of criminal activities, potentially ranging from elaborate corporate fraud to lower level instances of deception against individuals.  The figures cited also exclude other offences which might be considered as 'white collar' crime, including certain offences for which the appropriate regulatory and investigatory bodies are the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, and the Central Bank respectively.  As such the figures cited are not necessarily a reliable indicator of overall trends in this regard.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note in interpreting figures for detection and conviction rates that the investigation, detection and prosecution of any offence may take a considerable time.  This is particularly so where the crime may be complex, as is often the case in fraud offences.  Accordingly, the initial conviction rate for any given year will inevitably appear lower than the eventual rate.  For this reason caution should be exercised in comparing conviction rates for offences recorded in 2003 with those recorded in 2010.<\/p><p>  I can, however, assure the Deputy that I continue to attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar offences and bringing the perpetrators of such crimes to justice.  Shortly after taking up office I moved urgently to introduce additional legislation in this area which was enacted as the Criminal Justice Act 2011, and provides vital assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in white collar crime investigations.

This is provided for in the Charities Act. In this way, the regulation of charities will become largely self-financing in due course. It is only through utilising this provision that we are able to establish these new structures at this time of constraint in Government spending.

","asker":"1015","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 has not yet been commenced as provisions relating to the disclosure of convictions have had to be reviewed in the light of legal developments.  In particular, a judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in (On the Application of) T and others v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester [2013] raised new legal issues regarding vetting.  The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Having considered the judgement in that case, I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act.  Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill.  The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.   <\/p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children &amp;amp; Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 also sets out procedures to allow the disclosure of &ldquo;Specified information&rdquo;.  This is information other than a court determined criminal record.  For example, &ldquo;specified information&rdquo; includes conclusions from investigations of child abuse or neglect that have been conducted by the HSE, where such investigations have concluded that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons.<\/p><p>  The procedures set out in the Act are designed to ensure that the human rights of the person being vetted are adequately protected.  It is important to note that before specified information can be disclosed, the person who is the subject of the information must be given a copy of that information and must be given the opportunity to challenge the proposed disclosure.  The Act also provides that a disclosure of such information will only occur where there is a <i>bona fide<\/i> concern that the person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons, <i>and<\/i> the information has been assessed for its reliability and relevance, <i>and<\/i> the disclosure is in accordance with principles of natural justice.  The Act provides for the appointment of an independent Appeals Officer who will be responsible for assessing and deciding appeals against the proposed disclosure of specified information.  The Act also provides that a decision of an Appeals Officer may be appealed to the High Court, on a point of law.  <\/p><p>  By confining the information that can be disclosed to information arising from criminal investigations or statutory inquiries, and by ensuring that individuals who are the subject of such information have their right to defend their name protected in the Bill, the Bill seeks to ensure that information such as vague rumours, or innuendo or false allegations cannot form any part of the vetting process.  The Bill also ensures that the constitutional right of all citizens to protect their good name, as provided in Article 40.3.2 of the constitution, is protected. <\/p><p>  I expect to be in a position to commence the provisions of the 2012 Act in the autumn of 2014.

","asker":"1020","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 235 together.<\/p><p>  The Republic of India has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, as such it is not necessary to have a bilateral agreement with India. As a contracting state under the Hague Convention, the Adoption Act 2010 provides that adoptions by Irish prospective adoptive parents may be made subject to Irish and Indian requirements being satisfied  in line with relevant laws and the provisions of the Hague Convention. <\/p><p>  It is a matter for contacting states whether they wish to impose restrictions on whether and how intercountry adoptions of citizens of that State may be effected. In this regard, the Authority advises that there remains a general moratorium by the Indian Central Authority (CARA) on India accepting adoption applications from other countries other than in special circumstances. The Authority  has recently received an announcement from CARA that India is currently accepting packs from non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents for the adoption of Indian children (normal category). This means that India remains closed to non-Indian prospective adoptive parents at this time in respect of its normal categories of children. The Adoption Authority understands that CARA is accepting applications in respect of special needs children, which includes children over five years of age and sibling groups. The Authority is currently attempting to establish from CARA a possible time frame for the acceptance of application packs in the 'normal' category from non-Indian nationals. <\/p><p>  The Adoption Authority has advised it is their position that it is necessary to have an Irish registered accredited body to facilitate intercountry adoptions from India in order to safeguard the process for the child and the adoptive parents.  The Authority has two applications for India from Irish agencies which are being considered. Any accreditation being considered by the Authority can only apply to the Indian Special Needs Programme at this time. The accreditation of agencies to facilitate adoptions is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority under law. I have raised with the Adoption Authority the likely timescale of reaching conclusions on these applications and I understand it is intended to finalise the process promptly. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the Authority advises that it is the policy of CARA to impose the following age limits and age differentials. Again, they are a matter for the Indian authorities and are not specific to Ireland. <\/p><p>  - To adopt a child in the age group of 0-3 years, the maximum composite age of the prospective adoptive parents should be 90 years wherein the individual age of the prospective adoptive parents should not be less than 25 years and not more than 50 years. <\/p><p>  - To adopt children above three years of age, the maximum composite age of the <\/p><p>  PAPs should be 105 years wherein the individual age of the PAPs should not be less than 25 years and not more than 55 years.<\/p><p>  - In the case of a single applicant, he or she should not be less than 30 years of age and shall not be above the age of 50 years. The maximum age shall be 45 years to adopt children in the age group of 0-3 years and 50 years for adopting children above 3 years. <\/p><p>  Updates in relation to intercountry adoption from India are posted on the Authority website when available (www.aai.gov.ie).<\/p><p>  I have received a submission from this group in relation to intercountry adoption and arrangements  for a meeting with this group are currently being finalised<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300071#WRV00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300071#WRV00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300071#WRV00850"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[6979\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300071#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons with an intellectual disability in residential day care and on respite waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>Specialist Disability services are provided by or on behalf of the HSE to enable children and adults with a disability to achieve their full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible in the community.  Disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with or on behalf of the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>  In planning for the delivery of intellectual disability services, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and disability service providers maintain the National Intellectual Disability Database (NIDD).<\/p><p>  The NIDD provides a comprehensive database for decision-making in relation to the planning, funding and management of services for people with an intellectual disability.  The 2012 Report of the NIDD forecasts the future residential, day care and respite requirements of people with an intellectual disability in the period 2013 to 2017 based on 2012 data.  However, it is important to emphasise that the NIDD acts as a planning and forecasting tool and does not match individuals to the actual service they will require at the specific time it will be required.

This is a necessary feature of the Scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's  contribution.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.    The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.<\/p><p>  The NTPF assesses nursing home process under four criteria:<\/p><p>  - costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;<\/p><p>  - price(s) previously charged;<\/p><p>  - local market price; and<\/p><p>  - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>  Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, services and supports which are common to the vast majority of nursing home residents are included in the cost of care.  These are:<\/p><p>  - nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>  - bed and board;<\/p><p>  - basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>  - laundry service.<\/p><p>  Goods and services that are already available to individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the goods and services covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. <\/p><p>  Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review.

Under this legislation, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market and monitors developments on an ongoing basis. <\/p><p>There is a significant disparity in the membership age profile among the four commercial insurers operating in the market. VHI Healthcare continues to have a much greater proportion of members in the age groups 60-69 and above when compared to other insurers.  Insurers with more older customers have higher claims costs. For example, in 2012:<\/p><p>- VHI had market share of <b>56%<\/b> but had claims of <b>67%<\/b> of the total claims paid in the market.<\/p><p>- Laya had <b>22%<\/b> market share but had <b>14%<\/b> of total claims paid in the market.<\/p><p>- Aviva had <b>17%<\/b> market share and <b>13%<\/b> of total claims paid. <\/p><p>Given the disparities in claims costs, mostly related to age and health status, between competitors operating in the health insurance market, there is a need to support community rating with a robust risk equalisation scheme, to create a level playing field in the market. The aim of risk equalisation is to look at the market as a whole, and to distribute fairly the differences that arise in insurers&rsquo; costs due to the differing health status of all of their customers. It does so by providing risk equalisation credits (based on age, gender and level of cover) in respect of insured people aged 50 years and over. Without such support, health insurers have a strong financial incentive to &lsquo;segment&rsquo; the market by offering policies targeted at younger, healthier people. <\/p><p>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act,  2013 sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme from 1 March 2014.  These revised RE credits will further level the playing field within the market, by making older members less costly to insure. The Scheme supports competition by encouraging insurers to move their  focus away from avoiding older, less healthy customers and is intended to support the Government&rsquo;s efforts to maintain community rating in the Irish health insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300073#WRX01700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300073#WRX01750"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[7373\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300073#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to meet in full the total cost of providing the health services as outlined within budget 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Along with significant and sustained financial pressure on the health system and reductions in health and social care funding and workforce numbers, the health services have also had to respond to significant demographic pressures, with the population of the State increasing by 8% and the proportion of persons aged 65 and over growing by one fifth since 2008. <\/p><p>  Undoubtedly, therefore, 2014 is a challenge, perhaps the most challenging year so far. The 2014 HSE Service Plan, in setting out the health and social care services to be provided during the course of this year, outlines a comprehensive response to these challenges. The preparation of a Service Plan that complies with the Budget ceiling set for Health spending this year has been made possible as a consequence of the Government&rsquo;s Revised Estimates Volume adjustment, providing an additional &euro;47 million in funding for health services this year, the &lsquo;probity&rsquo; target reduction from &euro;133 million to &euro;23 million, and the further process that has been put in place regarding &euro;108 million in pay savings. These factors considerably changed the landscape within which the HSE prepared and adopted its 2014 Service Plan and enabled the HSE to submit a Service Plan, later approved by me, that the Director General  considers can deliver both significant health reform and benefits to the general public throughout this coming year. <\/p><p>  The delivery of this years&rsquo; Service Plan will focus on the dual challenge of protecting patient outcomes while, at the same time, reducing costs. This requires, inter alia, increasing emphasis on models of care that treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide safe quality services at the least possible cost.  I have every confidence that, despite the unavoidable resource reductions already referred to, the HSE will again, throughout 2014, manage, to a very significant extent, to maintain core services while also supporting growing demand for services arising from population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for drugs, higher numbers of medical card holders (up by 590,000 since 2008) and new costly medical technologies and treatments. <\/p><p>  The HSE has management systems in place to monitor service delivery throughout the course of the year. Should any unexpected contingencies arise the HSE is well positioned to identify such contingencies and to promptly take any necessary remedial actions without undue delay. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300073#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services Provision","counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300074#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[7374\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300074#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which orthodontic treatment remains available to meet requirements detected during school medical examinations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":746,"content":"<p>The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday.

Data from the HSE shows that average working hours for NCHDs in 2009 was 60 hours a week, 54 hours per week in 2012 and 51.4 hours in the third quarter of 2013.  The HSE is focused on advancing implementation of the Directive. Intensive negotiations conducted at the Labour Relations Commission in September and October resulted in agreement on a joint approach, involving hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs to achieving EWTD compliance.  The agreement focused in particular on steps to be taken in the period up to the NCHD rotation on 13 January 2014 to progress 24 hour compliance.  At a meeting between the HSE and the IMO on 6 February the progress made by the acute hospitals on achieving compliance with the agreed maximum 24 hour shift target was assessed. While the majority of hospitals have made significant progress, arising from that assessment the Director of Acute Hospitals will be imposing fines on a minority of hospitals where sufficient progress has not been achieved.  This is in accordance with the terms of the agreement reached at the LRC by the HSE and the IMO last Autumn.<\/p><p>  NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to facilitate the achievement of EWTD compliance.  Achievement of full compliance will also require reorganisation of the delivery of certain services within Hospital Groups.  The number of NCHDs in the public health system has increased by over 200 in recent years and now exceeds 4,900.  However, there are international shortages of NCHDs in certain categories and specialties.  There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract NCHDS, for a range of reasons including training opportunities and rural location.<\/p><p>  I set up the MacCraith Group to undertake a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career structure last Summer.  The Group is to make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system, planning for future service needs and achieving the maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.  The Group provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training and is now examining career structures and pathways following training with a view to preparing a report by the end of March 2014.

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased healthcare costs.  While not all HCAIs are due to AMR a significant proportion are.  HCAIs are not an inevitable consequence of healthcare - recent evidence suggests that up to 70% of HCAIs can be prevented depending on the type of infection and the baseline rate.<\/p><p>  The approach to prevention and control of HCAIs is similar irrespective of whether or not it is caused by an antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Therefore, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a dual focus:<blockquote> 1. Implementing measures to prevent and control HCAIs including those caused by AMR such as MRSA<br \/><br \/> 2. Implementing specific measures for AMR including  MRSA- These are outlined in national guidelines which have been recently updated<br \/><br \/>- Monitoring infections caused by AMR as outlined later in this response.<\/blockquote>  The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in this field for many years, including:<blockquote>- SARI 2001-2010 which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001.<br \/><br \/>- HSE &lsquo; Say No to Infection&rsquo; which focused on both HCAIs and AMR<br \/><br \/>- The RCPI &amp;amp; HSE national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010.<br \/><br \/>- Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals: - HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012<br \/><br \/><i>- S. aureus <\/i>bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital<br \/><br \/>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<br \/><br \/>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)<br \/><br \/>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)<\/blockquote>  The overall aim of the national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance.  Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients, these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines\/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients\/residents\/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented. <\/p><p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collates information from hospitals on healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistant organisms such as MRSA.  Information is also published on an ongoing basis for <i>S. aureus <\/i>and MRSA bloodstream infection &ndash; published quarterly to hospital level since 2007.  Notably, there has been an annual decrease in reported <i>S. aureus<\/i>  BSI, from 1,251 (2010) to 1,060 (2012).  To the end of Q1 2013, 18.6% were due to resistant <i>S. aureus <\/i>(MRSA), a reduction on 2012 (22.8%). <\/p><p>  In December last I launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus <\/i>(MRSA).  This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes\/long stay residential units and the community.  <\/p><p>  While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland which indicates an overall reduction of 59% in MRSA rates since 2006, as per the table below, Ireland&rsquo;s MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland.  I might add that I have ensured that Patient Safety has been made a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.<table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>No. of MRSA cases<\/th><th>Decrease<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>592<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>536<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>439<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>355<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>305<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>263<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>242<\/td><td>59% decrease on 2006 figures <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>180*<\/td><td>* Data provisional to the end of Q3 2013<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300075#WRZ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments Waiting Times","counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300075#WRZ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":789,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[7389\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021300075#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which the number of persons occupying hospital trolleys in respect of each of the public hospitals has fluctuated in the course of the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
