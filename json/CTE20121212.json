I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to discuss this important topic with the committee and I hope I can respond to some of the issues in the statement that were raised in the previous session with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department.<\/p><p>  I will begin by recapping the overall aims of the strategy which could be summarised as promoting the further development of a higher education system which is world class in both the quality of its education and research and the efficiency with which it operates and which is underpinned by a sustainable funding model.  That vision is consistent with the individual and collective strategies of the universities.  The seven institutions that comprise the Irish Universities Association, IUA, are all committed to research, research-led teaching, and educating rounded graduates who are imbued with the skills for both lifelong learning and employability.<\/p><p>  The operating environment for the universities is highly internationalised.  It is reflected in the increasing diversity of the staff and student population and the academic and economic linkages of the institutions.  It also reflects the importance of international trade to an economy such as Ireland's.<\/p><p>  Turning to the strategy, this year has been one of intensive activity for the universities and the IUA and I will summarise some of the main developments.<\/p><p>  Early in the year we were asked by the Minister to bring forward proposals for the reform of governance of the universities and we reported to the Minister in May.  A copy of our report is in our submission.  At the core of our report are the proposals for streamlining governing authorities and academic councils and in particular bringing a competency based approach to the selection of governing authority members.  <\/p><p>  In the context of governance I have to note our concerns about heads of a Bill published recently by the Minister relating to specific amendments to the Universities Act but I welcome the recent statement by the Minister in the Clock Tower that these proposals would be taken forward in the context of governance reforms overall.  As members will see from our submission, we are strongly committed to reforming the governance structures for universities.<\/p><p>  Regarding the first year experience, which is another important part of the strategy, we were asked by the Minister to examine proposals for reform of selection systems and entry to third level.  Our interim report is appended to our submission.  In that report we stressed the importance of the leaving certificate and selection and admission systems co-evolving and that one should not take place without the other.  We made a number of specific recommendations including the development of more common entry routes and the incentivisation of strategically important subjects.  We are now taking those and other considerations forward in a task force under the chairmanship of Professor Philip Nolan, President of NUI Maynooth, and my colleague, Mr. Lewis Purser, is the secretary to that group.<\/p><p>  In regard to teaching and learning, and this also bears on the first year experience, that is an important aspect of the higher education strategy and we strongly welcome the recent announcement of the establishment of the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning.  The national forum will serve as a national platform for academic-led enhancement of teaching and learning, linking institutional centres of expertise and existing networks.  Its focus will be on adding value to a great deal of work which has been undertaken already under the strategic innovation fund, SIF, initiative but which now can usefully be brought together in a more concerted way.<\/p><p>  On the important matter of funding and the sustainability of funding, we have also been engaging with the HEA on this and submitted a detailed response in our submission to its funding model consultation paper.  From our point of view, we reiterate the importance of an income-contingent student loans system which we have advocated for a number of years.  While we understand the perilous state of finances currently, we believe it is very important that the planning for such a system takes place now even though it may take a number of years to implement.<\/p><p>  On the specific matter of the trend in funding, we would point to two main trends.  The first is a decline in overall funding and the second is a shift from Exchequer to non-Exchequer funding.  These trends can be illustrated by examining income per student.  Between 2007 and 2008 and 2010 and 2011, income per student declined from approximately &euro;16,000 to just over &euro;14,000, which is a decline of 10.8%.  However, Exchequer income declined from &euro;11,889 to &euro;10,013, which is a decline of 15.8%.  One can see, therefore, that Exchequer funding is declining faster.  <\/p><p>  While those trends are of concern they would have been much worse if it had not been for the efforts of the universities to reduce their dependence on the Exchequer.  Non-Exchequer income is now a strong feature of all universities and accounts for, on average, about one third of university funding; in some cases it is close to 50% of some of the universities' funding.  It is essential that universities have the flexibility and agility to continue to compete for such income, whether it is from externally funded research, alumni philanthropy, postgraduate or non-EU undergraduate student fees.<\/p><p>  On the matter of efficiency about which I know the committee is concerned, at the macro level it will be recalled that a 2009 econometric study by the EU Finance Directorate found Ireland to be among a top ranked group of countries for efficiency of its higher education system.  Our peers were the Netherlands, Japan, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  Since that study was published efficiency has improved further, and that is underscored by the fact that between 2008 and 2012 staff numbers in the universities contracted by 10% while student numbers increased by 10%, further boosting efficiency.  The study found the system to be efficient because of its relatively low level of State investment which is below the OECD average; high levels of teaching productivity as reflected in student-staff ratios; high levels of research productivity and impact; and high levels of employer satisfaction.<\/p><p>  The universities continue to perform strongly across all of these headings and recent survey evidence, which we have seen in draft form and which we will share with the committee as soon as it is published, suggests that that continues to be the case.  However, it must be said that a fine balance needs to be struck between raw efficiency and the quality of the system and in that context, the continuing increase in student-staff ratios driven by ECF reductions in staff numbers and the burgeoning student population is of concern because the ratios have risen from 20:1 in 2008 to 24:1 on average in 2011.  That is in the context of those 20:1 ratios already being substantially higher than they would be in comparatively ranked universities elsewhere where they would be in the low to mid-teens.<\/p><p>  I would like to address some concerns raised by the committee in regard to administrative and operational efficiency.  Regarding the academic year and the use of facilities I wish to clarify a number of matters.  Universities operate for the full calendar year, and this is specified in the revised academic contract under the Croke Park agreement.  In that regard, universities do not close at weekends or during the summer and the summer period in particular is utilised for a range of activities that include short teaching courses, repeat examinations, postgraduate research, all other ongoing research, commercialisation and technology transfer activities, and a range of conferences and summer schools.  Many of those activities are very important as part of the non-Exchequer income of the universities.  <\/p><p>  Regarding the remuneration of academics, I am aware this issue was raised in the committee on the previous occasion and I would like to bring some context to it.  It is true that on average pay levels, in the aggregate, are competitive in Ireland; it could be said that they are very competitive.  However, our remuneration system is very homogenized which one does not find in other systems internationally.  There is evidence that it is not competitive in terms of recruiting the best talent either at the upper end or the bottom end.  One must be careful about data in this area because average levels do not reveal what universities actually do in practice internationally because most of them set their own wage rates.<\/p><p>  Moving to the higher education landscape and addressing the matter of collaboration, I want to stress the importance of competition and diversity in the system.  That is an important part of the strategy.  However, diversity does not preclude or militate against collaboration.  The members of the IUA and all our working groups collaborate strongly across virtually all aspects of the universities; I have referred already to some of those aspects of collaboration. <\/p><p>  Turning lastly to the higher education landscape process, we welcome the clarification recently from the Minister in his speech in response to the various HEA reports.<\/p> <p>In particular, we welcome the Minister's emphasis that the overall policy orientation in the Hunt report remains appropriate.  In that regard we believe that, with due regard for the maintenance of diversity, the most effective strategy is to promote inter-institutional collaboration reinforced by mission-based and regional clusters.  The universities intend to be proactive in taking this process forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355318700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage in this discussion on the reform of third level education and the Hunt report.  I am accompanied by Dr. Jim Murray Institutes of Technology Ireland, IOTI.<\/p><p>  IOTI is conscious of the policy directions outlined in the speech delivered by the Minister for Education and Skills at the launch of the National Forum for Teaching and Learning on 22 November 2012.  There were also presentations on the higher education reform programme made before this committee by the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, recently.  IOTI views the implementation of the national strategy for higher education as the most significant policy issue in higher education for at least a generation.  We recognise the critical role higher education must play in producing the human capital and knowledge that is necessary to support Ireland's economic and social recovery, as well as its future competitiveness and well-being.  To this end, we recognise all our institutes need to contribute to the creation of a system in which quality, capacity, flexibility and accessibility are all optimised.<\/p><p>  IOTI has played an active and constructive part in the change process before and since the publication of the Hunt report.  Regarding the landscape of higher education, in the light of the Minister's recent speech, it appears there are three options open to institutes of technology - to remain as single institutions; to amalgamate with other institutes of technology due to viability issues; or to pursue and complete, as amalgamated institutions, a developmental path towards application for designation as technological universities.  It is very challenging for individual institutes to determine their future direction.<\/p><p>  For those institutes of technology seeking to amalgamate or apply for technological university designation, there will be significant challenges ahead.  The success or otherwise of this process will depend on the level of support, clarity, future policy and even legislation given.  The need for clarity and consistency also applies to other processes associated with the reconfiguration of the system such as the collaboration envisaged between all the higher education institutions and other partners in the regional clusters.  In that regard, IOTI would welcome further guidance or direction from the HEA and the Minister in the areas of academic programme collaboration and rationalisation.  This is not about the retrenchment of programmes but about creating additional capacity needed for future demographic changes.  We know in 20 years time, there will be an additional 25% of students coming into third level.<\/p><p>  IOTI has actively supported the reform agenda in teaching and welcomes the establishment of the National Forum for Teaching and Learning.  As president of Limerick Institute of Technology, I am pleased Professor Sarah Moore, associate dean of academic affairs in the University of Limerick, is chair of this forum.  Developing innovations in teaching and learning is important, as well as sharing best practices.  This needs to be supported by the state-of-the-art technologies and resources.  We will also work on the development and implementation of the new national student survey and sustainable proposals for improving the transition experience of second level students into third level.  We are also concerned by the current financial hardship suffered by many students.  This matter needs to be resolved as it can impact negatively on the learning experience.<\/p><p>  The institutes of technology have been building their research capacity over the past decade to deliver a suite of strategically oriented, industry-driven research, development and innovation services.  This has been funded through a whole range of funding streams, be it Enterprise Ireland, the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and EU funding.  Some institutes have been successful at accessing EU funding.  For example, Limerick Institute of Technology's Marie Curie fellow has had his bioscience experiment, one of only eight from around the world, selected to be tested on the International Space Station.  There is a pressing need for a sustainable funding base for postgraduate education to meet the needs of the knowledge economy, both at the regional and national levels.<\/p><p>  The institutes of technology sector is very strong in its engagement with industry.  All its degrees are modelled to work towards employability.  In that regard, many of our degrees are highly specialised and there will be a continuing need for that type of architecture of our academic programmes.  All institutes have enterprise incubation centres.  The majority of the companies in these centres are spin-in and we work with them in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, chambers of commerce and so forth.  The enterprise centre at Limerick Institute of Technology has created up to 400 jobs through new companies.<\/p><p>  The Hunt report identifies the development of the international dimension of higher education as a key area.  The institutes of technology are endeavouring to increase the number of international students studying in their institutes, as well as the establishment of a range of partnerships with international higher education institutions for outwards and inward mobility.  We are also active in international trade missions such as the recent one to India.<\/p><p>  There is a considerable range of initiative and activities already under way associated with the particular pressing issue of funding, staffing and productivity.  We have seen significant budget and staffing cuts over the past four years.  We have responded not by retrenching but creating additional capacity.<\/p> <p>In the period 2008 to 2012 the total recurring budget has been reduced by 26%, while our core staffing levels have decreased by 8%, even as the overall number of enrolments has increased by 28%.  In cost per student terms, therefore, savings and additional productivity are in the region of 43%.  In staffing terms, the change in the student-staffing ratio has been approximately 35% in a negative direction.  I share the concerns expressed by the previous speakers that we can only go so far in this direction.  These figures should give pause for thought to all stakeholders who want to realise the ambitious vision we share for the national education strategy.<\/p><p> Whether individual institutes of technology see their future as amalgamated institutions or technological universities, Institutes of Technology Ireland intends to remain strong and play its part in delivering a higher education vision and strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maria Hinfelaar","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355319300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>My task is to briefly review the international context of higher education reform.  In Europe the reform process is known as the Bologna process.  The Bologna process is not a treaty but an arrangement of European states which was aimed at creating a European higher education area by 2010, in which students could choose from a wide and transparent range of high quality courses and benefit from the smooth recognition procedures required for free movement of labour.  Initially the three priorities of the process were to establish a standardised degree system for the familiar bachelor degree, masters and the doctorate which was not generally in use throughout Europe; to introduce quality assurance; and to develop the recognition of qualifications and periods of study.  The Bologna declaration of 1999 was designed to make European students more mobile and to attract students and scholars from other continents.  The higher education sector had been partially commercialised in other parts of the world such as in the USA which made profits or had a positive trade figure of $7 billion in 1996, whereas European higher education institutes were seen as serving national needs.  For this reason, higher education was not initially included in the Treaty of Rome.<\/p><p>  The process is managed by education Ministers who previously met every second year and now meet every three years.  There are 47 signatory members - 45 countries and 47 Ministers of education - and although the process was to have been completed by 2010, it has now been extended to 2020.  It was too ambitious to complete in the space of ten years, which is slightly longer than one degree cycle for a student from starting a bachelor degree to completing doctorate.  Ministerial commitment to the process was restated in the Budapest-Vienna declaration.  The Bologna process initially worked through the administrative structures at ministerial level and, in the Irish context, HEA level to develop higher education systems to meet the obligations imposed by the Lisbon recognition convention which states qualifications recognised in one member state shall be accepted fairly and without bias in others.  It became obvious, however, that changes would also be needed at the level of institutes of higher education and in classrooms in terms of the interaction between academics and students.  In response to this need, in Europe the Tuning project was started, with which I have been involved for 12 years.  This project is offering advice on every major continent on the reform of higher education.  The process that started with the aim of making Europe more competitive is now seen by our competitors as something to study.  Simply put, the world is watching us.<\/p><p>  Ireland has led the rest of Europe in the adoption of the Bologna reforms at all levels.  We have every reason to be proud of our achievements in this regard.  The recent establishment of Quality and Qualifications Ireland consolidates our statutory response to the process.  In 2009 Ireland was ranked as one of only six of 47 members that had complied with the ten fundamental requirements of the Bologna process at excellent or very good level.  Our national qualifications framework and system of quality assurance are accepted globally as examples of best practice.  Of the seven people sent by Europe to advise Russia on the reform of its higher education system, two were Irish.<\/p><p>  Similar, although less well publicised, changes are taking place at academic level.  Our institutes and individual academics have not received good press on this, although perhaps it could be argued that is their fault.  All of the universities and institutes of technology have established centres for excellence in teaching, learning and assessment.  Degree programmes are routinely described in terms of student acquired competences, or the abilities developed by the student; staff assessed outcomes, or what a student demonstrates he or she has achieved; workloads defined in a systematic way; and a European credit transfer and accumulation system which relates internationally recognised credits to a defined body of work.  These changes all conform to the Bologna process.<\/p><p>  It is reasonable to ask why world rankings do not reflect our success in this process.  However, as the European Universities Association notes, while the world rankings are meant to represent university quality, \"it is difficult, if not impossible, to measure and quantify quality itself, and therefore rankings use various proxies &ndash; some of which are rather distant from the actual quality of teaching or research\".  For example, Shanghai University benefits from the bonus points awarded according to the number of Nobel laureates in the faculty.  Europe recognises this problem and is developing a new multi-rank system, a prototype of which should become available next year.  One's ranking gets depends on the questions one asks.  The OECD is so concerned about the problem that it is developing an assessment of higher education learning outcomes, AHELO, which has been designed to determine how well an institute of higher education meets its stated aims.  These are completely different measures of quality and excellence and I firmly believe Ireland should support them.<\/p><p>  My experience with systems elsewhere in the world indicates that Ireland is in an excellent position to benefit from its progress on the Bologna process reforms not just in improving the mobility of graduates but also in making our training relevant to the needs of a rapidly changing knowledge based society and positioning us to make strategic international alliances in higher education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Paul D. Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355319300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, and the migrant education access campaign welcome the opportunity to address the committee.  The migrant education access campaign is an initiative of the MRCI to work with young people on the issue of equality of access to third level education.  It is of particular relevance to the review of the national access plan for 2013 and the reform process at the heart of the higher education strategy.<\/p><p>  MRCI is a national organisation which for the last ten years has worked with migrants and their families.  We operate a busy resource centre in Dublin city and have become aware of this issue through our work in it.  As the submission we supplied to the committee on Monday deals more thoroughly with the issues arising, I will focus on the key points.  <\/p><p>  The context of our discussion is that the Ireland of today is young and diverse.<\/p> <p>Two weeks ago, the HEA spoke here about our large, expanding and diverse pool of young people at third level as one of our biggest strategic assets.  We agree with that.<\/p><p> Ireland has experienced a sustained period of inward migration over the past ten years that has resulted in a very diverse and multicultural country.  Thousands of migrant families have made Ireland their permanent home.  For example, 17% of our population was born outside of Ireland and one in seven of our children comes from a migrant background.  A growing part of our diversity comes from the youth population.  The result is we have very diverse national schools, a very diverse student body at secondary school and at university.  Many of the young people to whom we have been talking and with whom we work came here to join their parents under the family reunification programme, which is an inevitable and humane reality of global migration throughout the world.<\/p><p> In terms of understanding access issues that arise for young immigrants, we are talking about young people who have lived here for a minimum of three years.  Many of those who have made Ireland their home over the past ten years have completed their primary school education and their entire secondary school education in this country.  In essence however, the problem boils down to the fact we have an immigration system that never really considered their arrival in the country and a third level education system that is significantly inaccessible for many of them.<\/p><p> I will mention the immigration dimension to this issue briefly as it is quite important.  While I understand this is an education committee, there is an important overlap between it and immigration.  There is a significant immigration dimension to the problem that is worth outlining.  The situation is complex and we believe a response will necessitate interdepartmental co-operation between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Education and Skills.  We see the Department of Education and Skills as having a key role and responsibility in terms of alleviating the inequity of access issue.<\/p><p> In the absence of a fully transparent and comprehensive immigration framework over the past decade of inward migration to Ireland, the window of opportunity for young non-EU migrants to secure citizenship has remained very narrow.  If children of non-EU migrants have not obtained citizenship - which is often outside of their control - prior to entering a third level institution, they face three scenarios.  Many committee members will be familiar with these scenarios in the context of people they have met through their constituency offices.<\/p><p> First, they will not qualify for the free fees initiative, because they will inevitably fail the nationality condition, despite having completed their second level education in the State and despite meeting the three out of five years requirement for residency.  Second, they will often not qualify for the higher education grants.  Third - the issue most pertinent to this committee's deliberations - they will not be able to reverse their fee status upon securing Irish citizenship during their third level education.  Therefore, they will be forced to continue to pay excessively high tuition fees and will be unable to enjoy the privileges of their newly acquired Irish citizenship status.  Ms Bazborodova will discuss that in a moment.<\/p><p> Over the past ten years, young people joined their parents here and set up their homes at a time when there was an absence of comprehensive immigration legislation.  We welcome the significant immigration reform that is taking place currently, but unfortunately it has not happened fast enough for these young people - the children of the first generation of immigrants - to be able to access their citizenship.  We acknowledge that interim measures in place now are important.  From an immigration perspective, young people are being facilitated to try to acquire citizenship, even if their residence stamps are not applicable.  We welcome this, but it is an interim measure in the absence of an immigration, residency and protection Bill which we will not see the heads of until 2013.  We know it will take some time to see the trickle down effect of that in terms of citizenship.  From that perspective, we would highlight the current leaving certificate cycle.  We estimate approximately 730 of these young people a year will have difficulties accessing citizenship under the interim measure. <\/p><p> With regard to the response of the educational system, over the past ten years universities have been unclear about how to respond to young people resident in Ireland long term, but not in possession of citizenship.  We have had very good consultations with access officers and fees officers in universities around the country on this.  Initially, these young people were deemed to be in the same category as international students, which was highly problematic.  However, over the past ten years, universities have applied an EU fees category as an interim measure.  This results, however, in tuition fees that are three times the rate applied to Irish born peers.  On average this comes to &euro;8,000 per year and over a four-year degree the accumulating difference is approximately &euro;40,000, without buying a book, getting a bus or having lunch in the canteen.<\/p><p> The final aspect we want to highlight concerns young people securing citizenship while in college.  Perhaps they just turned 18 at the time their parents got citizenship, but unfortunately had already started their degree course.  Even if they get citizenship in the first year of a four-year degree, they are told, more often than not, they are unable to reverse their fee status and must continue to pay the higher rate fees for the remainder of their course.  We have noticed that universities are responding to this issue on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>case by case base.  Often a solution is brought about only through the goodwill of the university or of those involved, but more often than not no solution is found.<\/p><p> Ms Bazborodva will now outline her situation.  It is important to hear from young people affected by the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355319900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Dia dhaoibh go l&eacute;ir.

They both pay taxes, but we do not get any of the benefits from the system to which they contribute.  <\/p><p>  There are hundreds of people in a situation similar to mine.  We are studying in areas important for the economy, the science, medical and IT areas.  We will contribute to the economy in the future.  We will pay taxes and we will be voters.  We are the future.

We would like the Department of Education and Skills to seek a meeting with the Department of Justice and Equality and relevant officials to monitor interim measures for naturalisation of children on non-EU migrants.

All four groups have provided comprehensive presentations outlining the issues as they see them and those presentations will be very useful to us.<\/p><p>  I would like to develop further some of the points made.  The Irish Universities Association representatives mentioned amendments proposed for the Universities Act and concerns within the university sector at the implication the Minister will have more control in terms of staff level and setting staff income.  Will the delegation elaborate further on how the universities see this operating?<\/p> <p> The delegates have said the level of funding per student has dropped by 11% in the last four years.  They have indicated that staff numbers have decreased significantly over the same period, leading to an increase in the student-staff ratio.  Obviously, these changes have been presented as efficiencies.  Some of them would have resulted from unmanaged retirements in various departments.  As in the rest of the Civil Service, people in this sector are leaving the system as they reach retirement age.  It is not the case that there has been a strategic intervention at global institutional level to ensure efficiencies are made, operations become leaner and quality is maintained and improved.  Will the delegates comment on how they have managed the reduction in staff levels in a way that has brought about efficiencies, as well as cost reductions?  How have they been able to protect quality at the same time?<\/p><p> I would like to ask those involved with the universities and the institutes of technology about the potential for developing online and distance learning.  What is their assessment of the potential value of such forms of education not only as a means of educating but also as a revenue stream?  What assessment has been conducted in this regard?  What are the views of the educational institutions on the potential of this activity?<\/p><p> The representatives of the universities and the institutes of technology have outlined that their funding has been cut in recent times.  The institute of technology sector has lost &euro;140 million in funding at a time when student numbers have increased from 51,000 to 64,000.  Similarly, the funding received by universities has decreased to less than &euro;11,000 per student.  As part of last week's budget, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, is seeking to generate more revenue from students by increasing the student registration fee by &euro;250.  At the same time, he has identified &euro;25 million in cash reserves that can be used to make savings.  Overall, this will mean students will pay more into the third level sector and the State will contribute less to it.  It is obvious that this money will be used to offset the expenses and funding needs in other parts of the education system.  What is the extent of the cash reserves in the institute of technology and university sectors?  The Minister has identified a figure of &euro;25 million this year.  I am surprised to hear there are cash reserves after five budgets in which serious adjustments have been made.  Are the cash reserves in the institute of technology and university sectors sufficient to allow for the &euro;25 million being sought in the year's budget to be absorbed?<\/p><p> According to the report, Towards a Future Higher Education Landscape, institutes of technology should have an opportunity to come together and apply for technological university status.  Do the delegates have concerns about those institutes of technology that will not become part of technological universities?  What is their view?  Are we looking at another tier of institutes of technology?  How do we ensure the quality and status of the existing institutes of technology are maintained?  I would like the delegates to comment on that issue.<\/p><p> I thank Professor Ryan for the update he gave us on the Bologna process.  It strikes me from his report that we seem to be performing reasonably well as we try to match the targets set.  He suggested the 2010 deadline was \"too ambitious\" and that \"it has now been extended to 2020.\"  He has said a small number of countries are considered to have seriously grasped the challenges put before them.  Is it the case that many European countries have not given this matter the attention or priority it needs?  Has anything changed in this regard to suggest that by 2020 we will have achieved the platform envisaged when the project was embarked upon?<\/p><p> I thank the representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre for their attendance.  I compliment Ms Lowry and Ms Bezborodova on their composed presentation about how this gap in the system has affected them.  I suggest the joint committee take up this immediate issue.  Perhaps, with the agreement of members, the clerk to the committee might write to the Minister to inform him of the presentation we have received today and ask for a response on the issues outlined in it which are affecting many students unfairly.  I refer to people working in this country and students who will join the workforce when they complete their studies.  This stark barrier to engagement in third level and continuing education is exceptionally unfair.  We need to try to find an immediate and short-term solution to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200007#G00400","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355320500,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We can do that.

I have read the reform document which goes into some detail on issues such as the expansion of bonus points.  Would the delegates like to comment on the system implemented this year?  I come from the north side of Cork city and the number from my community who go to UCC, an excellent university, can be measured in single digits.  Many of those who have one of the best universities in the State on their doorstep face huge barriers to entry, not all of which can be addressed by the university.  We have heard about other issues such as accessibility for the children of non-EU migrants.  Will the delegates give the committee details of the programmes or supports that may be available to try to encourage people from disadvantaged areas to access universities and institutes of technology?<\/p><p>  Deputy Charlie McConalogue spoke about the &euro;25 million cut in funding announced recently in the budget.  I am surprised to learn that all of the universities and institutes of technology have significant reserves.  Can we be given an idea of the impact this level of once-off budget cut will have?  It was mentioned that the pupil-teacher ratio had increased from 20:1 in 2008 to 24:1 last year.  That must have an impact on the quality of education.  Will the delegates point to some of the tangible ways by which the effects this has had can be identified?  I presume a tipping point is reached in all classrooms at primary, post-primary and third level.  Have we reached that point in the pupil-teacher ratio?<\/p> <p>I would welcome the witnesses' view on whether we are approaching those ratios or have passed that stage.<\/p><p> On pay, people are often vexed when they hear of the large salaries being paid in university circles.  It was stated earlier that the evidence indicates that current pay scales here, when compared with European standards, are not competitive in terms of securing the best talent.  Perhaps the witnesses would point us to where we can get that evidence so that we can examine it.  As I understand it, pay in this area in the UK is 30% lower.<\/p><p> In terms of the amalgamation of the institutes of technology, it was stated that there are three options facing the institutes.  It was also stated that institutes seeking to amalgamate will face significant challenges.  Perhaps the witnesses would briefly outline some of those challenges and indicate what supports will be needed for institutes opting to go down the path of amalgamation or seeking technological university status.  I presume the supports needed will be not only financial.  I would welcome information on what other types of supports need to be put in place to allow the institutes to achieve that status.  Also, if some institutes opt to remain as they are, could this result in the creation of a tiered system?  In other words, could we end up with amalgamated institutes, institutes with TU status and stand-alone institutes?  What systems or protections can be put in place to ensure this does not happen?<\/p><p> I am also interested in hearing a response to the issues raised by the Migrant Rights Centre, which are valid issues, in particular those around accessibility, which I accept might best be posed to the Department of Justice and Equality.  We will raise those issues with that Department.  We will also raise with the Minister for Education and Skills the reversal of that option when people gain their citizenship, if already in education.  I hope the other issues raised will be addressed in the immigration Bill when published.  That Bill has been published and withdrawn three times so far.  However, the current Minister has given a commitment to publishing it during this D&aacute;il session.  We are more than happy to raise the issues raised today by the witnesses with the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200008#H00300","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355321100,"counter":25,"content":"<p>As Senator Healy Eames must leave soon for a vote in the Seanad, she will put her questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200009#J00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200009#J00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Costello to respond to some of the questions raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200009#J00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321100,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I have one other question.  Obviously, there are significant obstacles in terms of funding.  We heard earlier from the witnesses about non-Exchequer funding, which in some instances is 33% and in others is 50%.  What action is being taken by the universities to increase their funding?  For example, are they reviewing the role of the alumni and giving consideration to the development of online courses?  Access to online courses generates income.  This has been done by universities in other jurisdictions.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200009#J00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355321100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will start with Deputy McConalogue's questions and then comment on some of the other points raised, following which my colleagues will respond to some of the specific issues raised.<\/p><p>  I will respond to the questions in the order they were asked.  On the legislation, as I stated, it is evident from our report on governance that we take the governance issue seriously.  We believe that the recommendations in that report in regard to the governing authorities and academic councils will significantly strengthen governance.  While I did not mention it in my speech, a revised code of governance is before the governing authorities of all the universities.<\/p><p>  I will outline our principle concern about what is contained in the draft heads of the Bill.  There is a strong suite of governance provisions in the Universities Act 1997.  They are centred around section 20.  I am speaking in this regard of where a university misbehaves.  Sections 19 and 20 deal with visitation.  They provide that where the Minister forms the view that there is <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence that a university has acted <i>ultra vires<\/i>, he or she can send in a visitor, who will be a judge or retired judge of the High Court.  That is the mechanism currently provided for in the 1997 Act.  To our mind, that mechanism has two important aspects to it.  First, cause is required in that the Minister must form the view that something is actually wrong.  Second, there is a degree of independence in the selection of the visitor.  In the heads of Bill as currently drafted, there are no requirements for cause and independence of the individual.  Therefore, the Minister is granted sweeping powers.  In essence, we believe that any further strengthening of governance - there may be some reasonable case for the strengthening of section 20 - should be addressed in the context of section 20, linked to the provisions we are proposing in relation to governing authorities.  The issue is one of appropriate checks and balances.  We do not believe the appropriate checks and balances are provided for in the Bill as drafted.  We believe the issue can be dealt with in a different and better way.  It is to be hoped this will be done.<\/p><p>  The point on staffing reductions is a good one.  When the employment control frameworks emerged in 2009-2010, we advanced the view that it is far more effective to control the budget and to allow institutions to make decisions, in terms of how they dispose of or configure their resources, in the best interests of students.  The employment control framework head count reduction approach means one must achieve a specified level of head count reduction and has limited control in that regard.  In the context of the no compulsory redundancies, save in respect of clause 1.6 of the Croke Park agreement, flexibility is further limited.  This has caused a certain amount of difficulty.  The no compulsory redundancy requirement has affected contract and casual staff.  That is one area where a reduction has been achieved.  Also, universities have tried to prioritise front-line services, whether non-academic or academic.  There has been a concerted effort in this regard.<\/p><p>  The other significant aspect is that universities have been actively managing the changed staffing requirement through the introduction of workload allocations systems to better balance workloads and better match staff to academic requirements which they are required to deliver.  This is all based around developments in universities in terms of the creation of schools, head of school position and the putting in place of a more effective management structure to allow universities in a modern way to manage their resources.  All of these developments, initiated by the universities, have helped in addressing the crisis.  However, there are limits on what can be done in terms of quality and sustainability, which is where the concern arises.<\/p><p>  I will pass over the issue of online learning, which Mr. Purser will address later, to the question about reserves.<\/p> <p>For absolute clarity, these are not cash reserves.  In other words, this is not money which has been put away in the bank and is available to do whatever an institution wishes to do with it.  Rather, it is the amount of cash on hand in the institutions in a given funding period.  If, therefore, one uses the analogy of musical chairs, when the music stops, there will be a person for every chair.  What is being done in the Estimates is a technical exercise.  As we understand it - this is based on the short briefing we received - cashflow to the institutions will be slowed down and they will, therefore, be obliged to draw on their working capital more extensively.  The reality is that at an accounting level they will carry a debtor forward into the next year.  Therefore, it will actually show up in the accounts of the universities.  It is somewhat technical.  I again stress the fact that there is not &euro;25 million in spare cash sloshing around anywhere in universities which can simply be delivered up without this materially affecting operations.  I hope that clarifies the position somewhat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355321700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Will this mean that the universities will be placed in debt or is the money actually available?

To be completely clear, universities operate on a break-even basis.  They prepare funding statements and are obliged to break even in any particular year.  They do this and then their accounts are laid before the HEA and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They will show that in any given year universities, by and large, break even, with minimal or negligible surpluses or deficits, as the case may be.  In general, there are small surpluses.<\/p><p>  On cash reserves, I reiterate the point made by Mr. Costello.  Effectively, there are cash reserves as a result of timing issues.  Institutions generally receive their fees in advance; their current grant is paid in advance, as usually is research funding.  At any point in time, therefore, universities will have cash on hand which relates to activities in respect of which expenditure is due to be incurred during the coming months or year, whatever the case may be.  Let us be absolutely clear - it is not spare cash; rather, it is cash that is held with a view to being run down over the course of the year.<\/p><p>  On the specific question of whether this means that universities will go into the red, it is a technical point, but the answer is probably no.  The financial year of the universities is based on the academic year, namely, to 30 September, whereas the funding provided through the Estimates process is for the calendar year.  There is a little scope for slowing the timing.  What will happen in reality is that universities, at the end of the academic year, will carry a debtor for funds to be received - across the higher education sector, both institutes of technology and universities - to the tune of the &euro;25 million identified.  That funding will be made good the following year.  It is not necessarily the case that universities will end up operating in the red.  It is a technical issue which saves the Exchequer money in a given year.

That money would not be sloshing around in the bank, as was just pointed out, but to provide reserves for investments, such as refurbishing buildings or for new recruitment.  We all know that State funding for capital development on our campus has effectively been obliterated.  Let me give one clear example.  The main campus of Limerick IT has 7 sq. m. per student and that includes circulation and teaching space.  The national norm in Ireland is 10 sq. m. per student.  The international norm is 15 sq. m. per student.  We must desperately find some way of increasing our footprint.  We are in the fortunate position of having a little bit of reserve put away but it is earmarked for that development.  It is to compensate for the fact that we had been approved under the PPP scheme for a new facility developed as part of the main campus to try to address that deficit, which has been abandoned.  We now need a plan B.  Our plan B is that our reserves may be earmarked and targeted towards capital development, which is obviously not an annual operating expenditure.  It is multi-annual expenditure in order to be able to maintain the quality of the learning environment.  We could spend our reserve in that manner.<\/p><p> Speaking for my own organisation and some of the colleagues in the sector, it is not only cash flow but there may be reserves that are restricted to capital development.  There is also a restricted reserve from the student services contribution, which is earmarked for keeping student services and the facilities outside the classroom up to standard.  It is quite a complicated picture.<\/p><p> In the IOT sector there are some institutions that have no reserves whatsoever and that is not a healthy place to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200010#K02000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maria Hinfelaar","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355322300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The types of reserves to which Dr. Hinfelaar refers exist in the university sector.

Benchmarking increased average levels of pay and they are now higher.  The level of pay increased across the board, and universities did not get to determine those levels.  Research is the one area in which pay is not determined centrally.  We have been trying to find out by internal research about pay practice as well as pay levels.  We have international contacts in countries such as Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.  These countries are not picked at random but are our labour market and the countries in which we compete for staff.  It is clear from these countries that once one gets to professorial level, the norm is that universities and institutions set their own pay levels.  We do not have physical evidence but we know they can pay what they want and pay very high levels, well in excess of what would be paid in Ireland for the very best people.<\/p><p>  I have one statistic on entry level pay from the United Kingdom.  Prior to the cuts, our entry level pay would have been competitive for two reasons, first, because the entry rate of pay was okay in the first place and, second, there was flexibility on the point of the scale at which one would appoint a new lecturer.  Now that we have got the 10% reduction and are restricted to appointing staff to the first point on the scale, because of the level of published information in the UK about pay, we have done a purchasing power parity calculation.  The starting salary in Ireland on a purchasing power parity basis would be $40,000, whereas in the UK it is $43,000.  It is below but not massively below the UK rate at the entry level.  At the upper level, it is virtually impossible to get figures because each individual institution can effectively pay what it wants.  We know there are certain other benefit packages that international institutions will offer such as houses, access to laboratories, the building of facilities for star researchers and so on.  They can throw these things into the mix in a way that we cannot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200011#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355322300,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue queried how we achieved the efficiencies and significant savings while maintaining quality and increased productivity.  It is fair to say the Croke Park agreement was instrumental in that.  In the IOT sector, academic staff are delivering an increase of 15% in contact hours.  Contact hours have increased from 16 hours to 18 hours per week or 18 hours per week to 20 hours per week.  It is maximising that.  That has helped to absorb some of the cuts.  There have been very significant and severe pay cuts in the sector which has obviously reduced the cost base.  The cost base has decreased, the teaching hours have gone up at the same time and once one starts adding that up, clearly one will have more capacity with the same level of resources.  At a very simple level that is how that was done. <\/p> <p>I refer to the question asked by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and another Deputy whether the TUs versus institutes of technology would lead to a third tier.  It is a complex question and not confined to our sector alone.  I refer to the most recent pronouncements by the Minister who talked about a strong institute of technology sector sitting alongside the successfully amalgamated and redesignated institutions that would become the TUs.  There is a great need for that mix of institutions.<\/p><p> In my view and that of my colleagues, this suggests that a strong IOT sector does not mean a stripped-down version of a current institute of technology with a narrower range of disciplines on offer or impoverished offerings of levels of qualifications.  That is how we would see the system going.  Our hope is that the investment in all our institutions such as incubation centres, applied research, enhancement grants by Enterprise Ireland, specialised equipment for very specialised areas, whether in bio-science or IT, would be maintained.  We hope to be able to contribute to our regional economies as well as to international networks, whether our future is as individual or amalgamated institutes of technology or indeed, technological universities.  It is important to safeguard the investment in the sector.

We welcome the suggestion to ask the Minister to respond to the committee.  I am very struck by the conversation today about funding and reform.  We live in the real world too and we are not asking for anything extra for these young people.  In our view, there is a sufficient number of young people to warrant an immediate response.  These are the children of our first generation of immigrants.  If they do not go on to third level education, if Tatiana and others are unable to finish their qualifications or even go to third level in the first place, it will have significant repercussions for our society and for our economy.  Tatiana is one of many - we are working with a total of 140 families on this issue.  Overwhelmingly, the young people we work with are represented in biomedical technology, in information technology, the sciences and medicine.  These are knowledge-economy subjects which are very important for our economic recovery.  From the perspective of integration and social cohesion, these young people are our future.  This has been highlighted in the conversation in the committee about education reform.  We are quite concerned about the repercussions at this stage, ten to 12 years after the first wave of immigration.  These young people live here and their homes are here.  They did not come here to study and work, they came to join their parents, but they want to study and work.  Young people now in secondary school are very concerned about this situation.  We understand this is a matter within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality and we intend to raise the issues with that Department.  However, the difficulty of obtaining citizenship when aged between 14 and 25, impacts significantly on the young people.  Universities have needed to set up interim arrangements for the past ten years.  The measure they have decided upon is an EU fees category, which is an anomaly because they are not EU young people.  However, they may not have been born in Ireland but they are Irish now.  The fees are still treble those paid by Irish students.  We are very concerned about the scenario faced by Tatiana.  We know of many similar cases where young people cannot reverse their fee status.  We need to discuss this with the Higher Education Authority in the context of equality of access.<\/p><p>  Our schools are very diverse but this issue does not affect hundreds or even tens of thousands of families.  There has been a reform of immigration regulations.  Young people are gaining citizenship.  If citizenship is granted to a parent then a child under 18 years of age is automatically granted citizenship.  The problem is with the timed-out issue, if a young person has just turned 18 years.

Given the needs of the nation, should funding to universities and to institutes of technology be linked to job creation targets?  All the institutions here are engaged in research.  The universities benefit hugely from funding from Science Foundation Ireland.  Over &euro;1 billion has been spent in that space since 2000.  The institutes of technology are involved in applied research and they are very close to the market.  Yesterday the Western Development Commission was here to showcase businesses from the west of Ireland which have been funded with seed capital from the commission.  One of the businesses is linked to NUI Galway and another is linked to GMIT.  Both businesses are in the job creation sector and both have created jobs.  However, the institutions are given no credit for having created jobs.<\/p> <p>The institutes and universities should receive credit in terms of the provision of funding when they create jobs.  It is a new target area in respect of which the Minister and the Taoiseach should seek to get the universities and colleges to engage.  I direct that question at Mr. Costello and Dr. Hinfelaar.<\/p><p> My second question to Mr. Costello is on the first year experience of students at third level.  Does he want to see the leaving certificate being retained as a terminal examination?  He will be aware that we are engaged in a huge programme of reform.  We have had reform in the junior certificate programme and are now moving to deal with the senior cycle programme.  He spoke in favour of collapsing the leaving certificate grade bands and having common entry requirements at third level.  What exactly does he mean by this?  What is his view and that of Dr. Hinfelaar of the notion that the leaving certificate programme is serving the needs of third level as opposed to those of students at second level?  Ms Bezborodova might have a view on this issue also.  The colleges and universities should have their own entry requirements, apart from relying on the second level programme.  Approximately 62% of students go on to third level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200012#M01100","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355323500,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The number has increased to nearly 80%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200013#N00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1355323500,"counter":70,"content":"<p>That is true, it has increased.

How can they do it and the universities cannot?<\/p><p>  I congratulate the delegates on the ECOFIN report and the notion of mission-based collaboration and centres of excellence.  I know the universities and institutes are looking at that aspect in line with the Hunt report.<\/p><p>  To move to the question of ratios and the salaries of academics, the delegates said the ratio had increased from 20:1 to 24:1.  How is the ratio worked out?  In some lecture halls one can see 300 students, while one can have a ratio of 10:1 at some tutorials.  That does not matter, however, if that is the basis on which it is worked out.  What matters is having a maximum size, for which I have argued at primary and secondary level.  Rather than coming up with a crude average figure, we should specify that there should be no more than X number of students in a lecture hall and at a tutorial.  What are the delegates views on this point?<\/p><p>  With regard to the salaries of academics, one of the delegates has said the average levels here do not reflect those internationally and that we are not accessing the best talent pools, yet many universities across the country attract enormous numbers of international lecturers.  Therefore, Ireland has an appeal.  It has been mentioned that there is a restriction in terms of the first point on the scale; I presume it is being said credit is given for experience.  It would very serious if that was not the case.  If the delegate is telling me that if I was a lecturer in the United Kingdom and came to Ireland, regardless of my experience, I would have to start at the first point of the scale, I would concerned be that this requirement would seriously damage the quality of our teaching profession.  On average, lecturers here are paid 30% more than their UK counterparts.  What is the average weekly teaching load of a lecturer in the institutes and universities?

Two weeks ago I brought 26 principals and deputy principals to China and we looked at introducing Mandarin as a subject here.

I am aware that something similar happened at local government level.

Is there a contraction of the number of such posts?<\/p><p>  I will make a political point.  On Mr. Costello's point about the need to plan ahead on the issue of loans, that is not Government policy.  It is an ideological policy issue.  For example, a number of years ago the university heads wanted to reintroduce fees, while the institutes of technology did not.  There was, therefore, a difference of opinion.  Things may have changed since, but there is no Government policy on a loan scheme.  Planning ahead would lead to something being brought in by stealth.<\/p><p>  I raised an issue previously to which the answer was \"Yes\" and I wonder if the position has changed.  Do colleges still offer free fees to the children of staff?  They did this a few years ago and it was in connection with the registration fee and had to do with employment contracts.  When I attended college, the children of staff of the universities did not have to pay fees.  I am not sure what the position is in the institutes of technology.<\/p><p>  Regarding the CAO points system, I realise there have to be reforms, but I make the point that the points system is a little like a democracy.  Winston Churchill said democracy was not perfect, but it is still better than all of the other systems that have been tried.  We used to have a system of matriculation, for example, or interviews, but largely they have been abolished.  I am aware, however, that there are exceptions in regard to access programmes and so on.<\/p> <p> One issue that came up in the report of the commission on the points system in 2000 was that colleges should have to publish the number of places offered through the CAO.  We have no transparency in this regard.  A number of courses have limited places and the points are high.  What is the reasoning behind that?  Will the universities agree to this reform, which was recommended by the points commission in 2000?<\/p><p> Approximately half the student population attend IOTs.  They have been an important part of our third level sector, as have universities, but that is not articulated well enough in public discourse.  I attended both a university and an institute of technology to study and my family have worked in the IOT sector.  Its importance lies in the way it has been so good over the years in the context of transfer, access and progress.  I worked in DIT Bolton Street and I knew somebody who went from being an apprentice to doing a certificate, a diploma and a degree in engineering before going on to postgraduate level.  Access was well provided for at that stage in the early 1990s by the sector.<\/p><p> With regard to the Bologna process, Professor Ryan mentioned that the EU ranking system would be different.  While that will be an important move, it is essential that access, transfer and progression should be part of the ranking and it should not just be a league table.  The social policy of the EU is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200013#N00800","speaker":"1010","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355324100,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Senator Healy Eames raise a large number of interesting issues and I do not know whether I can cover them all.

We know that the private returns - as in how much a person makes if he or she has a higher education qualification - are high here in an international context.  If one has a higher education qualification, one's employment prospects are greater.  I have reservations about a direct attempt to create a causal connection between job targets and higher education because that would inevitably lead to short-termism and an instrumentalisation of higher education and the complexities of the labour market are such that it is hard to draw such a direct causal correction.  The Government's jobs strategy has targets while the Department of Finance's medium-term forecasts suggest something different.  It is difficult to draw a line between a higher education outcome and a job outcome in a strict causal way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200014#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1355324100,"counter":78,"content":"<p>What about the fact that it is happening already where the sector has generated intellectual property having conducted the research and needs to examine ways to move that to commercialisation for the benefit of the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200014#O00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355324100,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Commercialisation is an important area and it is one on which we are collaborating closely with Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200014#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ned Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1355324100,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I referred to targets in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200014#O00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355324100,"counter":81,"content":"<p>There is the technology transfer support initiative, which has well-defined targets.

One of the areas under discussion is the development of greater common entry routes into first year.  Over the past ten years, there has been a proliferation of first year entry options within all the higher education institutions.  Some of this was in response to specific labour market demands, as combinations such as computer science and German or X and Y were wanted.   We found with hindsight that while those specific courses worked in certain cases and for certain small cohorts of students, it led in the round to a massive complexity in first year options for ordinary students and significant additional pressure on them because of the small number of places available on many of these courses.  By the nature of the small number of places and additional competition, the points soared upwards.  In some cases, the universities were guilty of playing that game blatantly and they have recognised that.<\/p><p>  The considered move at the moment within each university is to try to reduce the number of first year options for students.  For example, in the field of law, all universities have a first year law programme, a general entry into law, but they also have law with French or German or other options.  The intention is to bring back first year law without reducing the number of options available for students in second and third year.  A leaving certificate student will not use a specific code to apply for the course; it will be an option he or she can take when he or she is on the course.  Some universities have gone a significant way down this road and it appears to be working.  UCD, for example, gives all students these options clearly in their briefings before they apply and they can express their preferences when they apply.  UCD, therefore, knows what they would like to study down the road and can start planing for that in advance.  The points no longer creep up every year because of the availability of a small number of places on courses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200014#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser"},{"type":"speech","time":1355324100,"counter":83,"content":"<p>This is important for aspiring third level students.

Since 2010, they have rolled out a national programme called the higher education access route, better known as HEAR, which has been widely publicised in the media and school sector.  The programme is mainly targeted at second-level students who have the potential to succeed at third level but who, for all sorts of socioeconomic reasons, have tended not to get even near the university sector.<\/p><p>  There is a set of nationally agreed eligibility criteria that we have worked through with the Department of Education and Skills and other national stakeholders.  It is based on a multi-indicator model so as to tackle different types of socioeconomic disadvantage.  The bottom line since 2010 is that the number of students who have applied under HEAR has increased dramatically.  More important, the number of students who have been offered and who have accepted places has increased by over 71% in the past three years alone.  I refer to students from very disadvantaged communities, with endemic social problems in many cases.  Many of the students' parents never completed second level and, in some cases, primary level.<\/p><p>  As Deputy O'Brien stated, sometimes pockets of deprivation are inner-city pockets right beside the main universities.  This is an anomaly in 21st-century Ireland.  The universities and most higher education institutions do considerable outreach work with schools, particularly DEIS schools, across the country.  Examples include mentoring for students and homework clubs to provide the support students in other schools would normally get at home.  Campus visits familiarise students with the idea of going to college.  Students do tasters, explore the sports facilities and engage in all sorts of summer activities.  Thus, by the time they are ready to apply through the CAO system, third level is not a big mystery.  Walking through the gates of NUI Galway or Trinity College Dublin is no longer a big mystery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200015#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355324700,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Could I just revisit some of the questions that were raised that we have not addressed?  A very important question was on the challenges and supports associated with amalgamation processes.  I want to touch briefly on this.  First, we now have the Croke Park agreement, mark 1, which has a redeployment section.  LIT incorporated the Tipperary Institute.  We certainly utilised the mechanisms under the Croke Park agreement to redeploy staff who were no longer required to do what they had been doing.  For instance, we removed the entire middle management team in the Tipperary school.  Some individuals have gone to other institutes of technology and one or two have taken up other positions in the public sector.  One or two have taken up teaching roles.  There is flexibility.  It is essential that the successor to the Croke Park agreement, irrespective of what it is called, have a more sophisticated redeployment mechanism.  We actually found the existing mechanism difficult to manage.  There are all sorts of restrictions, including in respect of distances beyond which one is not allowed to travel.  There is really a need to flesh out the process much better and make it one of the vehicles through which we can successfully amalgamate existing organisations, thereby making staff more mobile and flexible.<\/p><p>  Second, legislation is required.  Currently, the 13 institutes of technology are listed in one of the Schedules to the legislation.  In order to amalgamate, an amendment is required.

He asked why the process is taking 20 years rather than ten.  People completely underestimated the size of the task they were taking on.  The Bologna Declaration is slightly over two pages in length and now has 47 jurisdictions reforming the higher education system in a co-ordinated manner.  This is a completely unknown experiment in European society and, therefore, we are learning as we go along.<\/p><p>  Let me give a specific answer rather than a general one.  The areas that have caused most difficulty in terms of the qualifications are the doctorate and the qualifications of regulated professions.  The aspects that have caused problems in regard to the management of higher education are quality assurance, recognition of prior learning and the development of national qualifications frameworks.  The latter two are inherently linked because if one is to recognise higher learning, one must place it on a framework; otherwise, recognition means nothing.  Only approximately one third of the relevant countries in 2009 had those aspects developed.  Approximately 60% had quality assurance, but it was extremely varied.  We have a system that is internationally validated and that assesses the relevant unit on its fitness of purpose, be it in respect of research, teaching, teaching and research, administration, the library service or some other service.<\/p><p>  Other countries have different systems.  The European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, ENQA, has a charter.  It is in our interest to keep ourselves well-informed about this and where other nations fit within the system.  It is essential that we try to achieve the best value for money.  We want to ensure every other nation is subject to the same strictures in an open market.<\/p><p>  I have outlined the organisational aspects.  Let me return to the issue of the doctorate.  Many countries around Europe had a five-year primary degree.  Some took seven years to do five but there was a five-year primary degree.  Theoretically, it was relatively easy to split that into a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, be it according to a three-plus-two model or a four-plus-one model.<\/p> <p>At the end of five years, the student had his or her master's degree, but there was an exit point in the middle at which he or she obtained a bachelor's degree.  The difficulty for these countries was in ensuring the exit point actually met the needs of their society, and this is where a great deal of the difficulty is now arising.  In a country where employers are used to hiring people after five years of university, those who have completed only four years will be seen as knowing less.  As such, some type of training programme might have to be agreed with the industry to make up the deficit.  There is a great deal of work going on in this area and new ground is being broken all the time.<\/p><p> There are two specific issues in regard to doctorates.  First is the balance between the two types of doctorate.  In the case of the PhD, which is the philosophy doctorate, the criterion, putting it as simply as I can, is whether the research is innovative and publishable.  The second qualification is the professional doctorate, which is common, for example, in the medical profession.  In this case, students have not spent three years doing a unique piece of research but have otherwise obtained qualifications at that level of expertise.  The difficulty arises in reconciling these two types of doctorates through national qualifications frameworks.  <\/p><p> The second issue regarding doctorates relates to the employability of PhD graduates.  Is a doctorate candidate training to be a blue sky researcher who will go on to work in a university?  Is a PhD student training to become an important member of a knowledge-based society?  These are the questions one must consider.  Throughout Europe and even within Ireland there is a major debate - the Government has part-funded initiatives in this regard - on how we can ensure that every research-based PhD includes within it some element of training for life which will allow the student to move with relative ease from the research environment into, for instance, an industrial environment.<\/p><p> The final issue in all of this relates to the regulated professions, in respect of whom there is a difficulty that remains unresolved.  The problem is that to have the competence to be a basic practitioner takes at least five years of academic training before one goes on to obtain whatever work experience is required.  I am advising pharmacists on this issue at the moment and have been involved in discussions with representatives of other medical professions in Europe.  These professions like the idea of a five-year initial qualification, but that is not compliant with the Bologna system.  There is a difficulty in finding the exit point, after three or four years, where one is not qualified to be a pharmacist or a doctor, for example, but where one has obtained a qualification that is of value to society and will enable one to gain employment.  The benefit of that type of system is that it gives both students and trainers more flexibility.  There are probably always a certain number of people who would be better off exiting after three or four years.  These are the main issues, as I see it, and I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions in that regard.<\/p><p> Before responding to the points raised by Senator Healy Eames, I would like to comment briefly on the notion of employability.  One of the issues on which we have concentrated as part of the Tuning project is the question of separating the subject-specific competences a student will gain from his or her particular course of study from the generic competences every student should obtain.  The idea behind generic competences is that there are skills which allow one to be a useful member of society.  An example would be asking students to give a presentation so that they learn how to get the PowerPoint slides in the right order, have the right number of words on the slides, speak clearly and deliver the major points.  These types of general competences are sought by employers.  As part of the Tuning project, we have asked employers around the world about the generic competences they require - we have used the term transferable skills - in order to determine the abilities they are they looking for in potential employees.  We expect to have compiled a data set next year comprising 69,000 responses from employers, which I will make available to the committee as soon as it is available.  It may not be the most fabulous statistical survey ever, but 69,000 answers are certainly worth looking at.  It will be a unique data set.<\/p><p> Senator Healy Eames asked how many students have had their qualification recognised.  That is now routine and is normally done through university admissions offices or independently.  I am not sure how it happens in the institute of technology sector, but it is done routinely.  We have a national academic recognition information centre which provides guidelines on how to do it, particularly if one is dealing with qualifications in areas with which one might not be familiar.  I am helping to write a document on this process for university enrolment officers on a European-wide basis, which will be published next year.<\/p><p> Regarding the Senator's question on the European credit transfer and accumulation system, ECTS, the answer is absolutely \"Yes\".

For example, a student who is registered at NUI Galway and who opts to study in Germany for a year might come back with 60 ECTS credits and with a workload and mark.  Even though different grading systems are in operation in different countries, by simply putting the two histograms together and normalising them, one can see the correlation.  If a student is in the top 20% of a German university, for instance, one would assume that his or her mark would be in the top 20% of an Irish university and so on.  That correlation is not difficult to do and happens quite routinely.  The student then returns to complete his or her studies and is awarded a degree by NUI Galway, but some of his or her credits have come from that trip abroad.  In fact, some of a student's credits may be awarded on the basis of experiential learning obtained before commencing a course.  For example, a person could come in with experiential learning and be exempted from certain elements of the first-year curriculum.  One is effectively being given these ECTS credits in recognition of one's portfolio.<\/p><p>  That is the normal or standard model for the operation of the ECTS in this country.  The other model is relatively new and exciting for Ireland and relates to joint degrees.  I did a survey on Bologna compliance in NUI Galway and this was the only area in which I found a difficulty.  A joint degree is very specifically a degree jointly awarded by two or more universities in two or more separate jurisdictions and valid in both jurisdictions.  There was some problem about the legal position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the NUI degrees, but that is now resolved.  This is an exciting development in Irish third level education which opens up the prospects of colleges here developing joint degrees with Russia or China, for example, if they have an ECTS model that we would accept.

This will be part of the broader discussion on missions in which all the different institutions are currently engaging.

One cannot predict it but it is difficult to say that face-to-face learning will disappear but online components are and will become even more a part of the pedagogic and learning environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200016#Q01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jim Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355325900,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I will come back to the access question and link that with the issue of some students on low points going onto some courses.  If we were to examine the intake of the institutes of technology, and as the Chairman pointed out, about half the students in the higher education sector are studying within the institutes of technology, IOT, sector, one would see a spread between AQA right up to 400 or 500 points across a range of discipline areas.  Clearly, these things fluctuate because we all know that in terms of the way the system works it is a supply and demand mechanism in one respect.<\/p><p>  We bring in students on low points in some areas.  The supports structures within the IOT sector are very strong.  For instance, all students would normally be assigned an academic mentor.  That academic mentor, who is a member of staff in that particular school but not necessarily on the teaching team for that particular student, would meet the student on a regular basis.  If there are issues with the student being able to keep up to speed with the course the mentor will try to direct the student towards the supports we have in our institutions.  We have learner support units, teaching and learning units and all the other structures such as counselling and access to try to make sure the students do not end up leaving the system.  That is a key strength of the institutes.<\/p><p>  In addition to that, through the ladder system a number of students who come in on level 6 programmes will exit with a level 6 award and may come back at a later point in time to complete a level 7 or level 8 course.  There is that flexibility where students can dip in and out of the system.<\/p><p>  We attract a huge number of mature learners who may have done the leaving certificate and not scored highly in terms of points but through recognition of prior learning, RPL, experience they bring in a wealth of other qualities, and we need to value those and give them the recognition for what they bring.  It is not a simple, straightforward issue of low points and therefore there will be a problem.  That is not necessarily the case; it is more complex than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200017#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maria Hinfelaar"},{"type":"speech","time":1355325900,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Dr. Hinfelaar spoke about the number of jobs to which she has contributed.

We find students coming into third level, and this is not just a university experience but is felt by all third level colleges, have been conditioned by the leaving certificate experience to learning and being assessed in a certain way.  A big challenge for higher education is to de-programme them from that experience to ensure they can learn in a different way in higher education.<\/p><p>  The purpose of collapsing the leaving certificate grade bans from, say, a C1, C2 and C3 into a new type of C grade would be to allow for a more innovative and much more sensitive assessment practice at leaving certificate where the assessment would be less predictive and the examinations the students sit would be less predictable.  <\/p><p>  In higher education in the past ten years we have introduced more outcomes-based modern assessment systems which examine students' competences as opposed to their knowledge.  Obviously, they need knowledge but what they can do with that knowledge and how they apply it is important.  In many cases that is not particularly successfully measured in the leaving certificate as it currently stands.<\/p><p>  We do not want to abolish the leaving certificate because there is a huge advantage in having a well-respected, national end of school examination.  As a country that is a benefit to us.  Other countries do not have that and they have to put in place alternative systems but we would like to see a modernisation of assessment practices at leaving certificate level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200017#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser"},{"type":"speech","time":1355325900,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Costello wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012121200017#R00900","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355325900,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Yes.

Anecdotally, in terms of those in university, I can think of ten other people who are affected, but the number of varies, as Ms Bezborodova said.  What we have found in induction and introduction meetings with young people and parents in the past few months and on outreach days on this issue is that many people are trying to get on with it, but they are struggling.  Many people through word of mouth come to our centre on this issue and we find that they have made decisions such as letting a child go into second year while holding a second child back from doing the leaving certificate examination, placing a debt on a credit card and so on.  Families are trying to make ends meet and adopt other arrangements.

However, it still amounts to double or treble the amount Irish people pay.  In Ms Bezborodova's case, she now has citizenship and her fees amount to treble what she would pay as an Irish citizen.

On the first issue, there are three draft Government orders giving force of law in Ireland to new double taxation agreements with Egypt, Qatar and Uzbekistan.  These are a draft order to update the double taxation agreement with Switzerland, a draft Government order giving force of law to a tax information exchange agreement with San Marino, and a draft order to give effect to a Council of Europe OECD convention on mutual assistance and tax matters.<\/p><p>  Double taxation agreements are widely regarded as crucial items of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trade and investment opportunities by reducing the tax impediments that might otherwise did deter such cross-border activity.  For a small, open economy like ours, so dependent on trade and investment with other countries, continuing to expand our network of international tax agreements is not only necessary but vital.  Double taxation agreements facilitate trade and investment by providing greater certainty to taxpayers regarding their potential liability to tax in foreign jurisdictions, by allocating taxing rights between two jurisdictions so that taxpayers are not subject to double taxation, by reducing the risk of excessive taxation that may arise because of high withholding taxes, and by ensuring taxpayers are not subject to discriminatory taxation in the foreign jurisdiction.  Double taxation agreements provide benefits to taxpayers and governments by setting out clear rules that will govern tax matters in respect of cross-border trade and investment.  Tax treaties ensure predictability and fairness in the tax treatment of taxpayers and spell out clearly defined provisions that facilitate companies investing in doing business overseas.<\/p> <p>This is achieved by allocating exclusive taxing rights to one country, or where both countries retain taxing rights, by requiring the country where the taxpayer is resident to grant credit against its tax for the tax paid in the other country.<\/p><p> Double taxation agreements cover direct taxes, which in the case of Ireland are income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  They are comprehensive in scope, covering both the taxation of companies and individuals, and are in the main based on the OECD model of tax convention.  Apart from relieving double taxation, double taxation agreements also include provisions dealing with non-discrimination in relation to taxation matters.  They also have mutual agreement procedures, which allow the tax authorities of both countries to consult with each other in taxation matters affecting the agreement, and provisions that allow for the exchange of information for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.<\/p><p> Ireland's tax treaty network compares very favourably with the networks of other larger OECD countries and now includes most of the world's major economies, accounting in aggregate for more than 80% of world GDP.  The Irish treaty network has grown by almost 50% in the past three years.  Through the remarkable work by our officials in the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Finance and the Revenue Commissioners there has been very impressive growth in treaties in the past three years.  We are a small country with finite resources and to conclude that number of treaties in three years is astonishing.  We have now signed comprehensive double taxation agreements with 68 countries, of which 61 are in effect.  Negotiations for new agreements with Egypt, Thailand, Ukraine and Uzbekistan have concluded and should be signed shortly.  Negotiations for new agreements with Azerbaijan, Jordan, Qatar and Tunisia are at various stages.  Negotiations for a revised treaty with the Netherlands will begin next week.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance and I will ensure that we continue to prioritise the further expansion of our tax treaty network over the coming months as a central element of our integrated strategy for an export-led sustainable economic recovery for Ireland.  I assure Members that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will continue to liaise with business representative bodies in identifying other countries where tax agreements would assist Irish business.  Of course, despite our best efforts there are some key jurisdictions that we have yet to secure and we will continue all diplomatic efforts to get these countries to the negotiating table.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the tax information exchange agreements.  These agreements, while serving a different purpose, are also important international agreements which strengthen the ability of revenue authorities in both countries to enforce their tax laws and thereby encourage the development of closer economic relations between both countries in the future.  We have now concluded tax information exchange agreements with 19 jurisdictions.  All of these are based on the OECD model TIEA.  The model TIEA grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices globally.<\/p><p> The OECD model TIEA now represents the international standard for effective exchange of information in tax matters.  There has been a significant acceleration of the process of signing TIEAs between OECD countries and offshore jurisdictions in the past couple of years mainly stemming from a threat by the G20 to blacklist jurisdictions that do not conclude at least 12 information exchange agreements.  The TIEAs will allow the Revenue Commissioners to directly request from foreign tax authorities information that is relevant to an Irish tax investigation, such as bank account information or company or trust ownership information.  It is, therefore, crucial that these agreements are in place to make sure the two way flow of information is in place, particularly when it comes to an individual on the Irish side's tax liability.  The agreements will greatly assist the Irish Revenue Commissioners in tax investigations involving entities and bank accounts located in these jurisdictions.<\/p><p> The final draft order today relates to the Council of Europe\/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.  The other agreements we are discussing today are bilateral agreements between this country and other jurisdictions, whereas this convention is a multilateral agreement between all parties to the convention.  Ratification of this convention will assist in the prevention and detection of evasion relating to Irish taxes.  It will enable the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to request information on persons located in the territories of other parties to the convention and this will assist them in determining whether those persons have a liability to Irish tax.  It will enable Revenue request other parties to the convention to collect Irish tax.  It will enable Revenue request other parties to the convention to serve documents on their behalf.  The convention offers more flexibility than a bilateral agreement such as a double taxation agreement as it is a multilateral instrument.<\/p><p> Today's consideration of these international agreements by the committee is an important step in their ratification process.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 10 December 2012 in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the draft orders is required before the Government can make the orders.  The proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the draft orders has been referred to this committee for consideration.  After consideration by the committee, the draft orders are then referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval.

When one goes to third countries and speaks to Irish businesses, it makes a difference that these taxation agreements are in place because it gives them some certainty in trading with those countries.<\/p><p>  To respond to the question on the key markets we have yet to crack in terms of the agreements, Brazil and Argentina are the two countries that stand out.  To be blunt, it is not for the want of trying on our part.  In making an agreement, it requires two people to come to an agreement.  To respond to his second question, there is a three way dialogue, a 'tri-alogue' between officials from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade who collectively work on this.  In key markets such as Brazil, and the Deputy would know from participating last year in the discussion on the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan brought forward measures to improve exporting to such countries.  We are very keen to come to an agreement with Brazil.  I think they are keen to come to an agreement with us but sometimes there are barriers to finalising an agreement.  Frequently one reaches an agreement in principle but it takes some time for the agreement to transverse parliament as each different parliament has its own way of dealing with these issues.  We accept that two key areas that have yet to come to the table and reach an agreement are Argentina and Brazil.  We are all trying to break into these countries and build new markets outside the European Union.<\/p><p>  The optimum agreement is the double taxation agreement, which has everything but a Tax Information Exchange Agreement, TIEA, is the first step towards a full double taxation agreement and is a stand alone measure.  Crucially from the perspective of the Revenue Commissioners, it allows us to have an information exchange on tax liability on both sides.  When we move to a full double taxation agreement, the TIEA is in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200004#C00100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355320200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.

It is complicated by the fact that \"global capital is as global is\", it can go anywhere.  In spite of the best efforts of national governments to capture the full tax liability of large global entities like this, it is the view of Government that the best possible agreements are brought about at OECD level.  I have spoken at OECD conferences.  The new mandate of the OECD is trying to get better governance, tax compliance and trying to close down loopholes and get an even playing pitch across the world.  It is a difficult task to achieve.  Deputy Stanley makes the point that the full 12.5% rate does not apply.  Without referring to individual businesses, some of the businesses can legitimately write off tax by conducting research and development, which is a crucial component of the development of their business in this country.  We recognise that in the taxation code.  I know the Minister for Finance announced in the 2013 budget that Ireland has become one of the first countries in the world to agree a new intergovernmental agreement with the United States on the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, that is commonly know as FATCA.  We have reached an early agreement with the US and this will be of benefit to Irish businesses.  We are not discussing this today but we hope to raise it for consideration by this committee in the near future.  That will be a key element of compliance, the issue the Deputy has raised.  It is complicated by the ability of businesses and capital to transfer quickly from one country to another.  We do not want to put ourselves at a disadvantage in any shape or form.  One of the great advantages of our corporate tax rate - which has the support of all parties - is that it is clear, transparent, understood internationally and has political support.  That creates a firm message for international businesses that come here, that they will be treated in an up-front way.  Other countries hide the total tax liability of the corporate sector.  We do not do that.  The system is clear and open and is, I think, a key driver in terms of the decision of international companies to locate and create jobs in Ireland.  Some 250,000 are employed in jobs that have been created directly or indirectly because of foreign direct investment out of a working population of 1.8 million people.  We must keep that at the forefront of our mind in the circumstances that nearly 300,000 people have lost their jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200004#C00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355320200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>As nobody is offering, we will now deal with the second item on the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200004#C00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1355320200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I am grateful to be afforded the opportunity to deal with the draft ministerial order on the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000.  The draft ministerial order being discussed by the committee today will, if approved, formally suspend the payment of the annual contribution of 1% of GNP from the Exchequer to the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 2012 and in 2013.<\/p><p>  Both the budget for 2012 and the budget that has been just announced for 2013 are based on the assumption that the contribution will not be made in those two years.  Suspending the contribution will also fulfil a commitment made as part of the EU-IMF programme that we would not make contributions to the fund while the programme is in place.  We are on track to meet our deficit target for 2012, as we did in 2011.  The current estimate of the 2012 general Government deficit is 8.2% of GDP, which is well within the 8.6% limit set.<\/p><p>  Budget 2013 is designed to achieve a deficit of 7.5% of GDP while being as equitable and as fair as possible and fostering economic growth.<\/p> <p>Budget 2013 marks the eighth announcement of consolidation measures since mid-2008.  All told, and including budget 2013, close to &euro;29 billion in budgetary adjustments or more than 17% of estimated GDP in 2013 will have been implemented.  Against this background, and taking account of the fact that we still have some way to go to achieve the target of a general Government deficit of 3% of GDP in 2015, making a contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund in these times is not realistic.  The State simply does not have the capacity to borrow this much money in addition to what it has borrowed already and continues to borrow.  If we were to make the contributions to the NPRF this year and next, it would have to be at the expense of other public expenditure.  I am confident Deputies will recognise the validity of this fundamental point and support the making of this order.<\/p><p> The background to this issue will be familiar to Deputies.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in 2001 by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy.  Mr. McCreevy's decision was one of the most enlightened and sensible measures taken during the period in question given that no one could have foretold subsequent developments.  The position in 2008 and 2009 would have been inordinately worse had it not been for the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  While the former Minister is criticised for many reasons, he cannot be criticised for establishing the pensions reserve fund as this rainy day money has been useful to the State in responding to the crash of 2008 and 2009. <\/p><p> The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 requires that an annual contribution equivalent to 1% of GNP is paid from the Exchequer to the NPRF each year.  The legislation was amended in 2009 to allow the Minister for Finance to direct the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, which is responsible for the investment and management of the fund, to invest in the banking system to improve the capital position of the banking system.  Following the enactment of the amending legislation, the Minister for Finance directed the commission to invest &euro;3.5 billion in each of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland through the purchase of preference shares.  The Minister directed the fund to invest a further &euro;3.7 billion in AIB in December 2010 and &euro;8.8 billion in 2011 and an additional &euro;1.2 billion in Bank of Ireland in 2011, bringing the total investment in the two banks to &euro;20.7 billion.<\/p><p> The National Pensions Reserve Fund legislation was further amended in 2010 by the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  The changes included a provision allowing the Minister for Finance to suspend, by order, the Exchequer contribution to the NPRF in 2012 and 2013.  This made sense in terms of the need to ensure overall Government debt, which is expected to peak at around 121% of GDP in 2013, is kept as low as is reasonably possible.  As I indicated, this decision also fulfils a commitment made as part of the EU-IMF programme that we would not make contributions to the fund while the programme is in place.<\/p><p> On the implications of the draft order we are discussing, the State paid a total of &euro;3 billion to the fund in 2009 to help cover the cost of the directed investments in the banks.  This figure consisted of &euro;1.6 billion in respect of 2009 and a further &euro;1.4 billion as an advance on the liability for future years.  In addition, under the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the assets of the pension funds of 16 university and non-commercial State bodies were transferred to the NPRF in 2009 on the basis that the pension liabilities of the bodies in question will be met in future on a pay-as-one-goes basis.  The value of the assets transferred was credited against the annual Exchequer contribution to the fund.<\/p><p> Taking these additional contributions together, there was no requirement for an Exchequer contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 2010 and 2011 and the liability for 2012 would be &euro;369 million.  The liability for 2013 would be &euro;1.339 billion on the basis of the GNP figure published with the budget.  The suspension of the contribution to the fund in 2012 and 2013 means the Exchequer does not have to fund a total of &euro;1.708 billion and this reduces the pressure on the public finances accordingly.<\/p><p> Looking to the future, the remaining non-bank, assets in the fund, which are referred to as the discretionary portfolio, were worth &euro;5.975 billion at the end of September 2012.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to use the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund for productive investment in the economy.  The Government announced the establishment of the strategic investment fund, SIF, in September 2011.  This fund will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund towards productive investment in the economy, following appropriate legislative changes to the investment policy of the NPRF.  As well as money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the strategic investment fund will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the economy.<\/p><p> A key principle of the strategic investment fund is that the NPRF investment, which is to be solely on a commercial basis, will seek matching investment from third party investors.  In this way, the fund's assets can be used as a catalyst to attract additional capital for investment in the economy.  In addition, the fund has been working closely with NewERA in respect of investment opportunities relating to the commercial semi-State sector. <\/p><p> The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission also announced, in November 2011, a commitment of &euro;250 million to a new infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to &euro;1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises, and new infrastructure projects.<\/p><p> The National Pensions Reserve Fund has committed, subject to certain preconditions, &euro;450 million to finance the national roll-out of domestic water meters.  As the Minister for Finance noted in his Budget Statement last week, the fund is also developing a range of support funds to provide equity, finance and restructuring and recovery investment to the small and medium enterprise sector.  The funds are expected to range in size from &euro;100 million to &euro;400 million.<\/p><p> To return to the draft order to suspend the 2012 and 2013 contributions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, I trust Deputies will approve the order as part of the Government's budgetary plan to restore order to the public finances and help rebuild the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200004#C00600","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355320800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his briefing on the motion and concur with the broad thrust of his argument.  Given that the country is in a programme and borrowing substantial sums to fund day-to-day services, it would not be logical to add to the deficit by transferring money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund at this time.  I have a slightly technical question.  If we were to make contributions to the fund, would they be accounted for in the annual general Government balance?  For example, during the good years, did every &euro;2 billion we invested in the fund reduce the general Government surplus by the equivalent amount?<\/p><p>  We must not make decisions that would in any way exacerbate current budgetary difficulties.  We have seen the difficulty involved in reducing expenditure in the budget by &euro;3.5 billion.  A further reduction of &euro;1.7 billion would be at stake if the investment were made in the National Pensions Reserve Fund. <\/p><p>  The Minister of State noted that the discretionary portfolio of the NPRF had a current value of slightly under &euro;6 billion at the end of September.  A substantial portion of these moneys should be put to work in the economy.  The Government has stated its objectives on the strategic investment fund, roll-out of domestic water meters and measures announced by the Minister in the budget.  Together, these measures add up to only &euro;1 billion of the &euro;6 billion available.  While no one is arguing that the money should be thrown away, we should identify and fund essential labour intensive projects that will position the economy for recovery.  As far as I am aware, none of this money has been spent.  While a notional allocation of &euro;250 million has been made to the strategic investment fund, the legislation underpinning this investment has not yet been published. <\/p> <p>I do not know when the roll-out of water meters will take place.

The Deputy is correct.  There is &euro;5.9 billion left in the non-discretionary side and he is also right in pointing out the Government's and the Commission's objective of spending close to &euro;700 million for investment purposes.  We are always looking at ideas for investment but there are two crucial issues here.  I am sure he agrees with me on this.  This fund, if it is to be used, must be used as a catalyst for private sector investment.  There is no point in picking winners and having the State fund this without getting matching funds from the private sector, otherwise it does not stack up.  Crucial in that regard are some good announcements made in recent weeks concerning the capacity for our public utility companies, ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and others, to start getting money back into their entities again after a long spell when money could not be raised.  One can point to public private partnerships all over the country as we get back to a more normal circumstance of trying to draw down funds internationally; having that matching funds into this fund makes sense.  The other part is that we should only make decisions if it improves our competitiveness.  There is no point in spending money willy-nilly on projects that do not derive an economic benefit for the State in terms of improving competitiveness and productivity.  That is important.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the legislation and made a fair point because, despite the Government announcements, we have yet to see the legislation.  It is a key priority of the Department of Finance to bring the legislation forward.  We are committed to doing it in 2013.  We recognise the money cannot be expended until the legislation is introduced to change the terms of reference for the Commission.  It is a priority for the Department and we want to get to it by next year.  I cannot give a precise date but I give a commitment to try to get that date from the Minister for Finance as soon as possible.  Until the legislation is changed we cannot use the funds for this purpose.  We have far too many projects all over the country which, in good times, did not yield any particular result.  We need to ensure this time that when those projects are up and running they have the effect of improving economic activity and getting the country to a more productive state and, more important, ensuring they are matched at the very least on a 50:50 basis from the private sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200006#E00800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>The question I want to ask is the potential impact of any deal on the legacy debt on the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  For example, if there was a deal on the legacy debt involving the ESM to retrospectively recapitalise the pillar banks or the purchase of preference shares in them, will the &euro;20.7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund be returned to the fund or used to pay down debt?  Some &euro;17 billion was paid in last year.  Surely, the right thing to do would be return it, if the money comes in from the ESM.  It could be used for private investment and job creation in the future.<\/p><p>  On the issue of job creation, PPPs and the 50:50 matching funds, I want to issue a word of warning.  A PPP project, the wretched toll bridge on the M50, although a legacy issue, is a huge cost on the taxpayer.  The N7 and N8 motorway runs through the county in which I live.  I worked out the cost of that motorway to the taxpayer over 25 years and discovered it comes in at a very high cost, and then the taxpayer buys it back after the 25 years.  The cost has increased because the company states that the volume of traffic is not as high as expected and the taxpayer is being called upon again.  Although this is a subject for another day, I give it as an example.  We need to be careful with PPPs and how we use taxpayers' money.  My specific question concerns the potential impact of any deal on the legacy debt through the ESM on the National Pensions Reserve Fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200006#E00900","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>The amount was not &euro;27 billion, &euro;20 billion is being invested from the NPRF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200006#E01000","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Was it not &euro;20.7 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200006#E01100","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Sorry I thought the Deputy said &euro;27 billion.  Some &euro;20.7 billion has been invested in the years in question in the pillar banks.  That investment is worth slightly more than &euro;8 billion today, if we could sell it all off tomorrow.  Obviously, there is an enormous deficit on the &euro;20 billion we put in.  In a circumstance where a deal were to emerge it would then be a matter for Government to see how exactly that issue would be resolved between the NPRF and other aspects of the financing of the State.  Clearly the Government is ambitious in terms of the discussions taking place.  The Deputy is aware more than most that those discussions are parallel.  At one level we are negotiating with the ECB on the promissory note side, which is roughly half of the &euro;64 billion that went into the banks on the Anglo side, but on the other, given the Heads of Government agreement last June when the EU leaders gave a clear undertaking to break the link between the sovereign and the banking debt and given the constructive remarks made by Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande in respect of Ireland's unique circumstance, we will continue to work on the recapitalisation money to ascertain how much we can obtain or in what form.  Let us work out the argument.<\/p><p>  There is a general expectation that the guarantee will come to an end at some point in the near future.  As a result of that the banks suddenly become more profitable and over a period of years, their business improves, they get more investment and international funds come back into deposits.  That investment is for us into the future.  The whole objective of the strategy, as John FitzGerald of the ESRI said recently, is to get our money back from the banks, the money we have had to stuff into them over a period of years as a means of shoring up the system.  How we get that money back is the issue as pointed out by the Deputy and what we do with it, if and when we get it back, is critical.  A key priority for the Government next year is to bring all these matters to a conclusion, not only on the promissory note side but on the bank recapitalisation side.  When that issue has been resolved it will be a matter for the Government to decide how to use those resources.  The Deputy is correct, an investment of &euro;20.7 billion has gone into the banks, the net worth of which is slightly more than &euro;8 billion, and there is an enormous gap of &euro;12 billion.  How that is worked out is a matter for the Government to decide in due course.  <\/p><p>  I do not disagree with the Deputy's remarks about PPPs.  He is right to point out deficiencies in the system.  The critical issue is the construction of the contract on those PPPs and the management of same.  We need to continually work on the contracts but into the future we should not put to one side the notion of a PPP.  An example near my constituency, which he will be aware of as he travels on it every day, is the traffic lights at Newlands Cross, in respect of which I am glad to say the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Roads Authority want to advance a PPP. <\/p> <p>We have the money on our side but we need private sector money to come forward.  We are confident we can do that.  Many of the reasons people are hedging their bets and not coming forward with the money relate to the risk to the sovereign.  As we diminish the risk to the sovereign, as has been demonstrated in our bond yields and the like in recent months, private sector risks in Ireland will diminish and people will begin to invest in these things again.  Once we can get those contracts up and running, and fair to both sides, there is no reason they cannot be a successful component of Irish infrastructural development in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12012121200006#E01200","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355322000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Is it the Government's view that some or all of the money should go back into the National Pensions Reserve Fund?

I prefer to get the deal done first and worry about where we put the money later.<\/p><p>  There is an outstanding pension liability for the future.  Last year, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform put in place a new model single-tier pension scheme that replaces the termination average with a career average.  As a result, the State's pension liability for people coming into the Irish public sector will be reduced by approximately 35% in the future.  That is a significant reform which the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has led.  On the other side, we still face a liability.

It is shameful that the fund is now depleting and we are not able to replenish it, because we are paying interest on the debt that has been unloaded onto the back of the State.  Next year, we will pay &euro;9.1 billion in interest on a debt that is, for the most part, not ours.<\/p><p>  I do not accept the trade-off the Minister of State presents between making funds available for the budget and putting funds into the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The real trade-off is between our capacity to invest in our own economy and create jobs and our obligation to pour &euro;9.1 billion in interest into the ECB or bondholders next year.  That is the real trade-off and it is unacceptable.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State suggests that in order to invest this money we have to have matching funds from the private sector.  This is alarming, but it gets to the heart of the real debate.  He is really saying the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which should be used to stimulate employment and the economy, is being used as a vehicle to privatise State assets.  That is appalling.  We should be using the fund for investment in projects that will create jobs and revenue for the State, and not for private interests.  <\/p><p>  There are times when we have to co-operate with other interests.  I propose that the Government revoke, and stop granting, all licences to private multinational oil companies for the development of our gas and oil reserves and meet the Norwegian Government and Statoil to discuss an arrangement for both states to co-operate, possibly with matching funds, in exploring oil and gas reserves in a way that would benefit this State and create employment.  Earlier today, the Taoiseach mentioned Norway.  Such an arrangement would be a far superior way to develop our natural resources and would be a good project for investing some of the money in the fund.  <\/p><p>  Why does the Government not invest some of the fund in social housing, which we know would generate rental revenue and reduce rent allowance payments to private landlords?  We do not need private partnership for that.  The State could and should to it.  It would be a sure-fire winner, providing for our citizens, bringing revenue back to the State, replenishing our funds and providing money for the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  Instead of selling off Coillte to private interests, why does the Government not invest in the development of our forestry?  Last week, I attended a meeting where someone who knows about the woodlands explained in much detail how we could create 100,000 jobs over ten years if we developed our forestry to the same level as Switzerland.  We have a 10% tree coverage in Ireland.  Switzerland, a much smaller country, has 30% and most of that is state forestry.  Huge industry spin-offs and employment are generated by the development of Switzerland's forestry.  This would be a sure-fire winner if it were done properly.  Why do we not invest in it?<\/p><p>  Why is there not a State programme, using these funds, to develop the insulation of houses and properties across the State?  That would put people back to work and reduce the energy costs of the State?<\/p> <p>If all of those things were done seriously by the State they would save funds and generate funds for the State.

It has been an extraordinary success that the amounts involved were considerably less in terms of the overall recapitalisation done in March 2011 than people thought.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked a question about forestry.  I am glad to inform him that the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, made an investment in forestry during 2009 with a &euro;20 million investment in an Irish forestry fund.  It is the first forestry fund.  The fund purchased about 5 million semi-mature trees from Coillte, which will remain in charge of the day-to-day management of it.  That is an example of the fund investing in a natural resource.  The Deputy would argue that we need to do more of that, and he may well be right, but it is an example of what the investment has done.<\/p><p>  For this fund to work and to create the jobs the Deputy and all of us want to see put in place, the NPRF's investment in infrastructure counts against the deficit unless it is commercial and less than 50% of the investment.

This is the first such day of hearings.  We will probably have at least two more, if not more.  As we have a large number of organisations with us today we will hear from them in groups of three.<\/p> <p>I thank everybody for giving of his or her time to come to the meeting and providing submissions on this important topic.  In group one I welcome from the Irish Medical Organisation Dr. Matthew Sadlier, vice president, and Ms Vanessa Hetherington, senior policy executive; from the National Women's Council of Ireland Ms Orla O'Connor, director, and Ms Jacqueline Healy, women's health and human rights worker; from Trinity College Dublin Dr. Gillian Wylie, and from the National University of Ireland, Galway Dr. Eilis Ward.  The format is that each group will make a short opening statement.  As we have received the submissions, there is no need to go through them.  Perhaps they might keep the opening statements to five minutes, in which they can make the necessary bullet points.  I realise time is short, but over 800 organisations and individuals have made presentations.  As a result, time is very tight.  There will then be a question and answer session with members.  As there is a lead questioner, one member will engage with one organisation.  Not every organisation will be subject to that arrangement, but most will.<\/p><p> Before we begin, I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

It thanks the committee for giving it the opportunity to present its views on the future of prostitution legislation in Ireland.<\/p><p>  International research shows that sex workers and those trafficked for sex are exposed to a wide range of physical and mental health problems, in addition to sexually transmitted diseases.  The demand for unprotected sex puts pressure on sex workers and exposes them to a higher risk of sexually transmitted infection and HIV.  Sex workers, particularly those involved in street prostitution, are exposed to high levels of violence, including sexual and physical assault, rape and murder.  Studies show that the majority of women and adolescents who have been trafficked or are involved in prostitution have been physically assaulted or raped and show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Other mental health issues are common among sex workers, including depression and anxiety disorders which can continue long after a woman has exited prostitution.<\/p><p>  Drug and alcohol addiction is also prevalent among sex workers.  Sex workers often enter into prostitution to support a drug addiction, but they can also become reliant on drug use as a support mechanism to cope with the trauma of prostitution.  Sex workers who use drugs are more likely to risk unprotected sex and neglect their health, seeking care only at more advanced stages of illness.  Research has also found that mortality rates are higher among females involved in prostitution than in the general population.  In London, mortality rates are estimated to be 12 times higher among women involved in prostitution than the national average, while a Canadian study estimates that mortality rates are up to 40 times higher.<\/p><p>  Data compiled from the HSE's women's health project in 2007 showed that the majority of women recorded symptoms related to sexually transmitted infections, reproductive tract infections or other health complications related to prostitution, including bacterial vaginosis, thrush, hepatitis A and B, chlamydia, vaginal-genital warts, urinary tract infections and cervical cell abnormality.  Project workers received regular reports from women of violence inflicted on them and expressed concern about the long-term impact of prostitution on the women's health.<\/p><p>  A study by the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, of drug using sex workers in Dublin found that the women and men interviewed were dependent heroin users before engaging in sex work and that a significant minority were minors at the time.  Most had grown up in marginalised communities and experienced prolonged periods of homelessness.  Most entered sex work for financial reasons or to maintain their drug dependency, while increased income from sex work invariably contributed to an escalation in drug use.  Drug use enabled sex workers to work longer hours and minimise distress levels as a consequence of the work but increased the risk of engaging in unprotected sex or affected their ability to assess the dangers of a situation.  A total of 78% of interviewees reported having hepatitis C, while 21% reported that they were HIV positive.  The vast majority had been physically or sexually assaulted by a client.<\/p><p>  Most women do not choose prostitution but are forced into it because of poverty, homelessness or a drug addiction.  Purchasers of sex exploit their desperation.  A wide range of measures is necessary to combat prostitution and sex trafficking, including the provision of health and social supports for prostitutes to enable them to exit prostitution, as well as social supports for young people at risk of prostitution.  There is also a need to change attitudes towards prostitution and the growth of the sex industry through legislation criminalising the purchase, not the sale, of sex and a public awareness campaign to educate the public on the physical and mental harm caused by prostitution and trafficking.<\/p><p>  Experience in Sweden shows that criminalising the purchase and not the sale of sex has reduced demand and contained the extent of prostitution.  A recent evaluation by the Swedish Government found that since the introduction of legislation in 1999 street prostitution in Sweden had halved.  In 2008 the number of people involved in street prostitution was estimated to be two thirds lower than in neighbouring Norway and Denmark.  While the level of Internet prostitution had increased, as elsewhere, the report found no overall increase in the level of indoor prostitution or trafficking as a result of the legislation.  Police officers and social workers report that purchasers of sex have become more cautious and surveys show that the legislation has had a deterrent effect on men.<\/p><p>  The IMO supports the Turn Off The Red Light campaign and calls on the Government to introduce legislation to make it illegal to purchase sex.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Vanessa Hetherington"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Hetherington, for staying within the time limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200004#D00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

It looks at the demand rather than the supply side of the equation.<\/p><p>  I accept the Deputy's point that men or women who enter prostitution - a certain percentage of men do enter prostitution - do so for various reasons.

Specifically, one is talking about post-traumatic stress disorder.  Sex work, even in areas where it is legalised, is associated with violence, degradation and other factors that can lead to mental health problems.  Another interesting study from Holland, an area where prostitution is legal, showed that depersonalisation - where sex workers move into a state of de-realisation to allow them to cope with the work they are doing - was prevalent.

It currently has 170 member organisations affiliated to it, representing an estimated 500,000 women.  Our vision is of an Ireland where all women and men have equal power to shape society and their own lives.<\/p><p>  The National Women's Council of Ireland welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the review of the legislation governing prostitution in Ireland.  The prostitution of women and girls constitutes a fundamental violation of their human rights and a serious form of male violence against women.  It is an issue that affects all women in society and the council has a strong mandate from its member organisations to work on tackling it.  At our annual general meeting this year our members voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion to lobby the Government for a legislative response to tackle prostitution and that the council continue its work as part of the Turn off the Red Light campaign.  The council has been a member of the co-ordinating group of the campaign which has been lobbying the Government to criminalise the purchase of sex as the best and most effective way to address prostitution as a form of violence against women and deter the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation.<\/p><p>  The National Women's Council is also involved in co-ordinating the work of the European Women's Lobby in Ireland.  The European Women's Lobby has been working on the issue of prostitution and trafficking for many years and is running a campaign, Together for a Europe Free from Prostitution, which we fully endorse.<\/p><p>  Prostitution cannot be seen as an occupation that women freely choose, but it is both a cause and consequence of the range of inequalities that women face in Irish society, in particular socioeconomic inequalities, barriers to active participation and inequality of opportunities and outcomes.  The existence and toleration of prostitution in Irish society intersect with other structural and systemic forms of discrimination against women and prostitution needs to be discussed within that framework. <\/p><p>  Research shows that nine out of ten women involved in prostitution would like to exit the system but feel unable to do so.  No matter how a woman enters prostitution, it is harmful.  Prostitution has a devastating impact on both the physical and mental well-being of women and girls, as has been well documented by some of our member organisations, including Ruhama and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  Both organisations highlight the strong link between prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  As our laws on prostitution have a direct impact on the problem of human trafficking, any Government strategy to prevent sex trafficking will be ineffective if it is not complemented by strong measures to tackle prostitution.  We must seek to eliminate the sex industry, not regulate it.  Regulation does not protect women and it does not work.  It only legitimises and encourages an industry that is inherently harmful to women.<\/p><p>  The introduction of legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex, while at the same time decriminalising those who sell sexual acts and offering enhanced and sustained support services to women who wish to exit, is the only viable way to work towards an end to this exploitative industry.  The introduction of legislation has great potential to establish a new norm in our society which deems prostitution to be an unnecessary and unacceptable social phenomenon and send a strong message to future generations that it is not acceptable for women to be treated as commodities, to be bought and sold for sexual use.  Prostitution is a violation of women's human rights, including human dignity.  The system of prostitution perpetuates patriarchal views on women's sexuality and legitimises male domination in society.  As long as it is tolerated, it is an obstacle to equality between women and men.  A society that tolerates prostitution cannot achieve gender equality.  The abolition of the system of prostitution is a progressive and realistic objective, based on the fundamental principles of equality between women and men.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqueline Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1355321700,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Healy and Ms O'Connor for their presentation and the expression of these views.<\/p><p>  My first question has to do with the diversity of women's experience.

Because of that diversity, I am interested that the council is coming out with these very strong recommendations.  There are some who would say a move towards the Swedish model would offer us a one-size-fits-all approach.  Given the diversity of women's experience, there may be some who freely choose to enter into prostitution and feel their human right to make this choice is not being violated.<\/p> <p>I think the witnesses may have had some of those discussions in the context of coming to a resolution to make these recommendations.

Part of the analysis is about where women come from in terms of entering prostitution, which is socio-economic disadvantage, poverty, debt, a history of abuse, and neglect.

We do not represent any institutional, organisational or advocacy position.  We are here as social scientists who have been working on research in this area for about ten years.<\/p><p>  We want to make three general statements and then I will speak generally on the sex trade and my colleague will speak on sex trafficking.  Any discussion of prostitution must be based on the recognition it is associated with both rights and risks and any productive analysis and workable policy must consider both questions.  We know very little about prostitution and the sex trade in Ireland.  There has been very little competence research and there are very few benchmarks against which the change could be measured.  We are aware the sex trade in Ireland has been largely privatised and may be largely beyond the reach of the State in terms of traditional surveillance and interventions.  Our knowledge of sex trafficking is also very scant.  This raises similar questions in terms of measuring change and the effectiveness of policy.<\/p><p>  We have four comments to make about the sex trade and prostitution in Ireland.  We have a very limited knowledge base of the sex trade in Ireland.  That is particularly problematic when it comes to making statements or establishing causality between changing the law and changing practice.  We know nothing about transactional sex.  We know very little about social policies and practice, we know little about gender equality research and practice and we know very little about vulnerability and practice, in other words what it is about the women involved in the Irish sex trade, their vulnerability profile and involvement in the sex trade.<\/p><p>  There have been some micro-studies and drawing on those we know the Irish sex trade has adapted to every single change in the law or policy since the foundation of the State.  The sex trade has simply changed and this reflects a global pattern whereby the sex trade is infinitely adaptable to all laws and changes in policy.<\/p><p>  Such research prompts two generalisable conclusions.  Every one of our statements is based on evidence-based research.  The generalisable conclusions are that prostitution may be an area of public policy which cannot be managed or controlled effectively primarily by law, although not by social policy.  In addition, prostitution may be an area of public policy that can never be completely abolished.<\/p><p>  Related micro-studies reveal a vast diversity of experience of those in the sex trade in Ireland, with both men and women with different sorts of experiences.  There are different experiences with levels of risk and risk taking behaviour, and different experiences with vulnerability.  Two of the studies based on research among prostitutes in Dublin support the case for managed zones or decriminalisation.  Furthermore, Dr. Kathryn McGarry's micro-study on women and risk-taking in the sex trade in Dublin supports the concern that abolitionist regimes such as the Swedish model increase risk, especially for the most vulnerable in the sex trade.<\/p><p>  Both of these conclusions drawn from Irish studies are supported by two consistent themes in the international literature, namely, that women in prostitution are not homogenous and are not all victims and they do not wish to be seen as victims - many first-person stories and narratives resist this label - and abolitionist or prohibitionist regimes increase the risk for marginal questionable gains.<\/p><p>  Recent discourses in Ireland proposing the Swedish model are not supported by evidence-based research that validates the suppositions contained within the Swedish model.  There is no evidence to say the suppositions in the model support its applicability to Ireland, largely because we do not have the comprehensive research that would be required for policy change in this area.<\/p><p>  We suggest the situation captured above constitutes an unwise basis for the implementation of legal change, particularly given the critical literature on the Swedish model that is now beginning to emerge.  From the point of view of prostitution, the State's current legal framework may be as good as it gets, an accident of history rather than planning, in that it enables the containment of the growth of the industry.  In addition, its intention is not to criminalise the sex worker, although in practice it does, and it enables policies to minimise the risk to the individuals involved in the sex trade and risk in terms of public health issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200007#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eilis Ward"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355322900,"counter":254,"content":"<p>There are different ways of regulating prostitution, through abolition or legalisation, or points in between.  These are often discussed as ways of combating sex trafficking.  The international research and literature is highly inconclusive.  The Dutch national rapporteur reports ongoing sex trafficking in the Netherlands.  The Swedish Government's own evaluation has provided very little concrete evidence of the efficacy of the Swedish law as a means of combating trafficking.  The 2012 \"Trafficking in Persons Report\" of the US State Department names both Sweden and the Netherlands as countries of transit, destination and exploitation for human trafficking.<\/p><p>  There is a problem in the conflation of sex trafficking and prostitution.  As Dr. Ward said, people experience a diversity of outcomes and experiences in the sex trade.  Our research showed that and the Department's conference poignantly illustrated that with very divergent views from the floor from women involved in the sex trade.  It is also important to recognise that human trafficking occurs for reasons beyond sexual exploitation, such as forced labour.<\/p> <p>If we are to take a demand-led model, we need to understand the complexity of demand for exploitable labour in society more generally, in domestic work and in construction.  This leads me to an analysis which points to the importance of recognising the paucity of migrant workers' rights and the lack of access for migrant workers to employment in the European Union, creating a nexus between trafficking and migration.<\/p><p> In Ireland we have had an anti-trafficking law since 2008 and we are in line with our UN and EU obligations.  We have anti-trafficking infrastructure, policing commitment and civil society collaboration with the anti-human trafficking unit.  There have been investigations and prosecutions but barely any convictions.  While I do not maintain everything is right with Ireland's current anti-trafficking legislation or with what happens to people identified as victims within that law, at the same time we have the makings of an adequate anti-trafficking framework in the Irish context.  These issues, along with the necessity of addressing the issue of migrant workers' rights more generally should be considered by the committee in combatting human trafficking rather than the reductive route of criminalising the purchase of sex.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200007#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gillian Wylie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355323500,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ward and Dr. Wylie.

I wish to address a number of points, some of which may respond to questions asked earlier.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland is a core member of the Turn Off the Red Light campaign, of which the committee is aware.  We are one of 64 robust organisations which represent most counties and sectors in Ireland.  We come from very different perspectives and angles to the issue of prostitution and sex trafficking, but what unites us is that we believe if demand for sexual services is tackled by targeting the buyer it will have a real impact.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland came to this conclusion in a number of ways.  We commissioned robust research which over a 21-month period examined sex trafficking and prostitution in Ireland.  It was one of the first studies of its kind in Europe and was conducted by Dr. Pillinger, Dr. Kelleher and Monica O'Connor.  I hope the committee will invite them to present their findings.<\/p><p>  What also motivates us as a human rights organisation is that we challenge the notion that prostitution is a harmless transaction between consenting adults.  Survivors of prostitution are at the core of the Turn off the Red Light campaign and some committee members heard their remarks in the Oireachtas a number of weeks ago.  When they described their experience they left us in no doubt of the violence that underpins prostitution and sex trafficking.  We have a particular lens on human trafficking as a migrants rights organisation concerned with the migration process, and we were delighted earlier this year when the US President, Barack Obama, highlighted it as modern-day slavery.  He is prepared to apply the full resources of the US Federal Government to combat the problem.<\/p><p>  Trafficking for sexual exploitation is the biggest human trafficking phenomenon in Ireland and throughout Europe.  In our research we identified 102 cases, but these are only the cases that have come to our attention.  They tell horrifying stories of which committee members are aware, such as that some of the women with whom we have worked did not even know they were in Ireland, never mind whether they were in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Portlaoise, Letterkenny or any other town or city.  There is a demand for child trafficking in Ireland and we have seen evidence of it as 11 of the 102 cases involved minors and 29 child trafficking cases have been identified by the Irish State.  Some media reports on high-profile cases uncovered child victims of trafficking.  The sex trade allows and facilitates child trafficking, for which there is a demand in Ireland.  This provides a reason for the legal change.<\/p><p>  There is much discussion about voluntary prostitution.  One cannot talk about sex trafficking unless one takes a stance on prostitution.  Within the sex industry are varying views and voices, and all voices should be listened to and respected, but we must be very clear that one cannot confuse the fact that a minority of women have independence and agency within the sex industry with the fact that the average age of entry is appallingly low.  Children do not have a choice to consent and the average age of entry into prostitution is 14.  We cannot avoid the fact that the majority of women enter prostitution because of poverty, child abuse, gender-based violence, war or broken promises of a better life after having had few choices in their own country.<\/p><p>  I wish to discuss the link between prostitution, the sex trade and organised crime.  Somebody asked earlier about research into the amount of money being made out of prostitution in the black economy.  Based on our research, we estimated a figure of approximately &euro;180 million, while the Criminal Assets Bureau has a figure of approximately &euro;250 million for organised crime in Ireland.  One does not have to take our word for it; as part of an independent investigation for \"Prime Time\", the journalist Paul Maguire tracked women and saw how they were moved at high speed from one area of the country to another, that mobile phones were bought in bulk, and that few of the women even knew they were in Ireland.  Paul Connolly of TV3 also had a programme that looked at how vice gangs use force to keep women under control.  In the Linnane case the women were filmed and were allowed to use only one baby wipe per customer.  There is a high level of control in prostitution and the sex trade.  All of this confirms what survivors and the women who access our services tell us.<\/p><p>  We have had a conversation on whether the law is fit for purpose.  It was developed at a time when women were on the streets selling sex.  It is now a multi-million-euro industry which has gone online.  Earlier we spoke about whether the Swedish law has sent prostitution underground.  Prostitution has gone onto the Internet in every country regardless of the legal context.  The nature of the crime means it must be accessible so that punters can find the women.  The law in Ireland is not fit for purpose.  We have had minimal prosecutions and very few women and victims have been identified as having been trafficked.  We have two legal options.  Many of us have visited the Netherlands, where it was decided to legalise the commercial exploitation of prostitution in 2000.  Between 50% and 90% of women in prostitution do not want to be there and were forced into the industry against their will, according to the Dutch police.  A total of 50% of brothel managers have a criminal record and it is now the hub of human trafficking.  Ten years after the decision to legalise prostitution, an independent evaluation was carried out which showed the welfare of women in prostitution was worse on all measured health indicators.  It was also clear from the independent evaluation that one cannot separate legal adult prostitution from child trafficking, illegal prostitution or criminal gangs.  Twelve years after the law was changed in Sweden, 250 prostitutes are for sale on the Internet in that country, which has a population of 9.5 million.  In Ireland, a thousand women are for sale in a population of 4.5 million.  Amsterdam has approximately 2,500 legal brothels.  The law in Sweden was introduced against much public opinion and now it enjoys 80% support.<\/p><p>  The Turn Off the Red Light campaign includes people who represent every county and sector in Irish society.  We are nurses, doctors, human rights organisations, farmers, trade unionists and survivors and we are all asking for the law to be changed.  Eighty public representatives support us and nine local authorities have passed motions advocating the change we seek.  We believe if one wants to change the exploitation, rape and violence which occurs in the sex trade in Ireland today and stop child trafficking, one must target the buyer.  It has worked in other jurisdictions and we believe firmly that it will work here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Denise Charlton"},{"type":"speech","time":1355324700,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Charlton for her presentation, which mentioned voluntary prostitution.

The reality is that wherever there is a sex trade, there will be child trafficking, exploitation of adult women and illegal prostitution.

Trafficking is a legal definition that most of the women in the sex industry are not even aware of.  If women who are in the sex trade come to the immigrant council seeking assistance, often it is with regard to their immigration status.  That is how they present to our services.  Alternatively, they present to the women's health project because of a health need.  They do not describe themselves as having been trafficked; they describe themselves as being in the sex trade.  They can then be defined as having been trafficked in order to receive limited services in the country, but it is a legal definition.  I would say that women present as being in the sex trade and then some of them are identified as having been trafficked.  There is an absolute link; one cannot separate the two.  It is merely a way of defining some women within that industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200011#L01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Denise Charlton"},{"type":"speech","time":1355325300,"counter":309,"content":"<p>In Sweden, the penalty is up to one year's imprisonment, but that rarely happens.

I note that in its presentation the ICI recommended a fine-by-post approach only, not imprisonment.

We have a moral and societal responsibility to ensure children are protected from those who may harm them.  For children who have been exploited through prostitution, it can taint every day of their lives both now and into their future.<\/p><p>  The reality is that child prostitution is a grotesque form of sexual exploitation.  It is not something that any child chooses but is something they are coerced into by people seeking to make money, exert power over them or by circumstances.  Children abused through prostitution are often not visible on the streets and this makes it easier for abusing adults to continue to exploit these children for their own gain and gratification.<\/p><p>  The harm caused to children by sexual exploitation through prostitution is well documented and the emotional impact of that harm can show itself in a range of behaviour such as self-harm, addiction, overdosing, eating disorders and criminal activity.<\/p><p>  Given the secretive nature of prostitution, it is hard to identify the scale on which children are involved.

From the statistics available to us, we know that at least half of women involved in prostitution first became involved when they were under 18 years of age.  It was evident from the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme that the women concerned certainly were under 18 years when they first became involved in prostitution.  That programme also highlighted the fact that this issue no longer was just occurring in urban areas but was taking place throughout the country and that children were being moved around to meet demand.<\/p><p>  As for the experience of Barnardos, members are aware that it is Ireland's largest children's charity and has 42  projects nationwide.  Through our guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> service which helps to present the best interests of children in court proceedings, we have worked with children who have been taken into special care because they have been sexually exploited and with others who have engaged in prostitution as a means to feed an alcohol and drug problem.  We have also come across instances of children from the Roma community being pimped out.  In addition, through our teen parent support programme, we have worked with children who have been trafficked and are trying to escape from their trafficker.<\/p><p>  Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur on child protection, agreed in his fourth report that children who were leaving the care system were particularly vulnerable to becoming engaged in prostitution, as are those who have experienced homelessness, suffer from alcohol or drug addictions or both, as well as separated and trafficked children.  Child trafficking does not simply equate to children being brought into the country from outside Ireland but is also linked with internal trafficking.  The anti-human trafficking unit's annual report for Ireland for 2010 found that six of the 19 children who were alleged victims of trafficking were Irish.<\/p><p>  Barnardos UK and Barnardos Northern Ireland have worked for a number of years with children who were sexually exploited through prostitution.  In their experience, reporting rates of child prostitution will always remain an underestimate because many of the children do not view themselves as victims or do not believe they are even being exploited.  Moreover, the phenomenon of so-called lover boys is growing, which sees young adult males becoming the boyfriends of vulnerable teenage girls, usually aged around 13 or 14 years, and making them sleep with other men.  The girl is terrified that the lover boy will break up with her and so will oblige, after which the boyfriend tells her that he is proud of her and consequently she feels happy that she has made him happy.  However, the girl quickly becomes scared and emotionally dependent on the boyfriend because he threatens her and states he is the only one who can protect her, yet he is also there to confuse her because occasionally he can be affectionate and consequently she thinks he genuinely cares about her.  As a result, the girls can feel completely trapped and confused.  As we heard, according to the research, young people aged 12 to 15 years are those most at risk of experiencing sexual exploitation.  Those leaving the care system and certainly those in residential care as opposed to those in foster placements are particularly at risk.<\/p><p>  As for current legal protections, while a number of laws are in place for children who have been abused, they do not explicitly deal with prostitution and its organised nature.  The three main laws that deal with the exploitation of children through prostitution are the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Act 2007, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 and the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  Both Barnardos and our partners in the Turn Off the Red Light campaign believe that fundamentally the most effective way to tackle the issue of prostitution is to introduce criminal sanctions against the buyers of sex as a way to discourage the demand for prostitution.  While the introduction of legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex would be a fundamental step as it would benefit all those exploited through prostitution, Barnardos also believes there are other legislative measures that could reduce child exploitation.  For instance, I refer to introducing the offence of grooming which is still outstanding and has been sought for a number of years.  This offence would reduce the chances of children being exposed and lured into situations which could result in abuse and exploitation.  Moreover, as children leaving the care system are particularly vulnerable, having an automatic guarantee of after-care services could certainly help such vulnerable young people and reduce their vulnerability to being involved in child prostitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200014#O00100","nonspeaker":"Ms June Tinsley"},{"type":"speech","time":1355326800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I seek further detail on the offence of grooming as this is the first I have heard of it.

In that time we have worked with thousands of women and girls who have been involved actively in prostitution, both indoor and on-street, who are seeking to exit or still remain involved and with those who are victims of trafficking, as well as with women with a past experience.  Notwithstanding the actual research which we also conducted over a period of two years and published in 2005, as well as this international research, most importantly, our direct contact with women and girls over this period of 23 years informs our position on the entire issue of prostitution.  We have concluded that, overall, prostitution is both intrinsically harmful and violent to the women and girls involved.  In addition to the significant physical damage and risk, there is the emotional and psychological harm which has long-term consequences, even after women have exited the sex trade.  It erodes self-esteem and self-confidence, can cause depression and, as has been mentioned, creates issues regarding post-traumatic stress disorder.  In addition to the harm to each individual, there is the social, cultural and global impact, that is, the damage to the social position and perception of women both nationally and globally.  If one woman's body is perceived as being for sale, the implication is that all women and girls potentially are for sale, which undermines directly the potential for gender equality.  Unless we recognise the harm caused by prostitution and the real challenges faced in getting out, once one finds oneself involved in that life, as a society, we are falling short of meeting the needs of those who need support and are involved in the sex trade.<\/p><p>  Those who argue in favour of decriminalising or legalising prostitution tend to take a highly utopian view of the sex trade.  They take the perspective that if one regulates, it will all be okay, that one can eliminate or minimise child prostitution and child trafficking and can make it safer for everyone involved.  Our experience - I have travelled to both Sweden and Amsterdam - is that this is an utterly unattainable goal because prostitution is predicated on the availability of vulnerable young girls and the exploitation of vulnerability of impoverished women in the main to ensure the demand for sex for sale is met.  It is not possible that there would be enough of that small cohort of freely choosing independent women who are without control, coercion and have other positive viable choices available to them.  There are simply not enough of those woman to meet the demand.  Consequently, there will always be exploitation in the sex trade, no matter where it is situated or how it is regulated.<\/p><p>  As a support service, we are completely non-judgmental of individual women's involvement in prostitution because we understand the complexities of entering therein and the barriers to exiting therefrom.  However, after 23 years of witnessing and hearing from women about their experiences and the awful challenges they often face, it simply is impossible not to judge the systems and structures, as well as the other stakeholders who complete the picture.  Pimps are pimps.  They are not agents or managers, which tends to be the dialogue one hears.  These are pimps who are making money off the backs of others for the profit of others at very high gain and low risk to themselves.  Buyers, equally, simply do not care about the reality of the women and girls they buy and this has been well documented internationally.  Their focus is entirely selfish.  I draw the joint committee's attention to an appendix to Ruhama's submission which gives a sample of the reviews left by Irish sex buyers of the women they purchase right across this country.<\/p> <p>One example is as follows:<blockquote><br \/>First of all, she is not the girl in the photos.  She kept me waiting half an hour.  We met at her apartment, then with another girl.  I had the choice of two and went with the so-called [name].  One good thing, she has a tight pussy but that is where it ends.  I would avoid.<\/blockquote>That is the attitude of the sex buyer with regard to the women and girls being bought.  These people simply do not care where the women come from and it is about the good time the buyers have.<br \/>The commercial sex trade in this country is also actively organised by criminality, and there are numerous criminal gangs organising and profiting from prostitution of vulnerable women and girls right across this island in urban and sometimes very rural settings.  To separate trafficking from organised prostitution, as the representative of the Immigrant Council of Ireland has indicated, defies logic.  Given the mechanisms by which the sex trade operates, victims of trafficking are advertised in the same places as all other forms of the commercial sex trade and not in a separate corner or cohort that is restricted.  A cohesive approach to organised prostitution is also the means by which perpetrators and victims of trafficking can be identified and assisted.<\/p><p> We have spoken much about the Swedish model as a way forward but this is really about examining the Swedish example.  We must develop an Irish model fit for an Irish purpose and Ruhama believes there is scope to create an environment in Ireland which is hostile to those criminally organising and truly profiting from prostitution while recognising and ensuring that those who find themselves involved in prostitution are not prosecuted and criminalised but supported.<\/p><p> Targeting the sex buyer sends a clear message that buying sex is not socially acceptable.  There is no human right to buy sex and sex buyers are not a vulnerable group whose rights need protecting in this regard.  This minority of men - it is one in 15 men, compared to up to one in three in Spain - drive a very large and profitable criminal trade.  In addition to considering the criminalisation of the purchase of sex, there is a need to recognise that existing laws are out of date and fall short, making the organised sex trade difficult to police.  This is particularly with reference to the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Act 1993, as there have been so many changes in the Irish sex trade since the law's enactment.  In reviewing legislation there should be a strong increase in penalties and sentencing for specific offences involving the organisation of prostitution.  There should also be a review of the legislation to account for the use of modern telecommunications such as the Internet and mobile phones by pimps and traffickers in both the advertising and organising of prostitution, which has contributed significantly to the large-scale growth in the Irish sex trade over the past decade.  The use of these technologies allows for anonymity in pimping and trafficking, as people no longer need to be on-site to operate crimes, making it much more difficult to police organised prostitution.<\/p><p> For those in the sex trade it is equally important that they receive the message that they are not criminals and that they can seek health, emotional, practical and police support when required.  For the majority of people, who are trying to get out, it is critical that the maintenance and further development of resourced exiting programmes and health services creates alternatives and viable choices.  Updating the 1993 legislation in tandem with criminalising buyers and the continued provision of health and social support services for those in prostitution form an Irish model that would achieve the best outcomes in reducing the degree of organised crime and exploitation in the sex trade in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200014#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Benson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355327400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the group for the presentation.

It cannot be driven underground.  This has been consistently argued by police in jurisdictions where the sex buyer has been criminalised in a process where the overall trade is criminalised with the exception of those working.  If a buyer is seeking a service or product, he or she must be able to find it.  If the buyer can find it, authorities can find it.  We see advertisements all over the place and on the Internet.  When looking for this activity, it is not hard to find.<\/p><p>  With regard to whether we are putting the cart before the horse, our argument is that we must start this process in order to make it possible for the limited resources of the NGOs and the Garda to respond.  Given the significant extent of the involvement of organised crime in the indoor sex trade, if Ireland becomes a less attractive location the market will shrink.  If something is not against the law, a cohort will do it; if the activity is outlawed, a portion of that cohort will stop doing it.  That will lessen the incentives for routes that go as far as South America and Africa to bring women here.  If the attraction is eliminated, the market will dwindle.<\/p><p>  We are very stretched with our resources, as is the Garda.

The difficulty is how we can be sure the Garda will examine the thousand Internet images and use surveillance on every one to ensure that users are prosecuted and that there will be necessary social service supports for women.

Act to Prevent Trafficking, APT, is a faith-based non-governmental organisation working to end human trafficking, with a particular focus on those trafficked for sexual exploitation.  In addition to awareness raising, we seek the implementation of effective legislation to prevent trafficking and provide better conditions of recovery for victims.<\/p><p>  Demand is the primary driving force behind sex trafficking.  The way in which the State addresses the legal status of prostitution will have a major impact on efforts to control trafficking.  For this reason, APT recommends that the purchase of sex be criminalised.  We are convinced that prostitution and sex trafficking are inseparably linked.  Even women who allegedly enter the sex trade willingly have little or no freedom to consent.  Poverty, coercion and deception are factors that prevail in this area, as is evidenced by research carried out by Kelleher <i>et al<\/i>.<\/p><p>  The sex industry does not differentiate between free and forced participation and nor do those who buy children, women or men in prostitution.  Approximately 75% of women in prostitution became involved when they were children.<\/p> <p> The so-called sex trade and the crime of sex trafficking are forms of contemporary slavery and are growing in the 21st century.  Act to Prevent Trafficking, APT, holds that it is important for legislators to address prostitution as a root cause of sex trafficking.  We also believe that the demand of the buyers for sexual satisfaction without responsibility is the primary driving force behind sex trafficking and prostitution.  Without this demand, it would not be profitable for pimps, recruiters or traffickers to seek out a continuous supply of vulnerable people to exploit.  APT takes the view that prostitution is sexual exploitation, violence against the person and a grave violation of basic human rights.<\/p><p> Reports from the UN, UNESCO and the European Commission show that, where prostitution is legal, as in the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, the demand for prostituted women and girls is such that the local market cannot cope.  Where prostitution is considered as work, sex migration becomes easy when girls and women can be coerced into demonstrating that they are coming for employment or that they will be self-employed.<\/p><p> Targeting the demand for the purchase of sex would lead to a decrease in prostitution, as evidenced in Sweden.  Contrarily, where prostitution has been legalised, the illegal trade in sex has increased, especially through human trafficking.  Therefore, our key recommendation is to criminalise the purchase of sex while decriminalising the seller, as in the Swedish model.<\/p><p> Current legislation on prostitution in Ireland is based on considerations of public order and the sensibilities of so-called ordinary citizens with no concern for the well-being of those prostituted.  Whereas the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 has made it an offence to purchase sex from identified trafficked victims, the burden of proof imposed on the State has been such that there have been no prosecutions to date.  This measure is an ineffective deterrent for buyers of sex.<\/p><p> The terms \"sex industry\", \"sex trade\", \"sex work\" and \"sex workers\" have become current and imply an honourable status to what has been shown to be the worst form of physical, emotional and psychological abuse to which a human being can be subjected.  To call it work is to degrade the notion of decent work as set out by the International Labour Organization, ILO.  Decent work has been defined as being productive work for women and men in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.  To legalise and regulate prostitution as sex work would allow criminals and members of organised crime rings to become legitimate business people with the State sanctioning the marketing of people's bodies, something that would be repugnant to many, if not all, people.  The myth that male sexuality must be provided with or is entitled to a category of women called prostitutes who are legitimate targets for rape and sexual exploitation is still prevalent.  We consider that to legalise prostitution would add State support to and justify this gender-based fallacy.<\/p><p> Prostitution is a demand market created by those who buy another's sexuality for their profit and pleasure.  It treats people as merchandise and legitimate commodities.  Therefore, we strongly recommend the criminalisation of the buying of sex as a necessary first step in addressing sexual exploitation in prostitution and human trafficking; that the State continue to criminalise those who promote and benefit in any way from this trade; and decriminalising those who sell sex and the provision of support services to assist victims of trafficking and those who wish to exit prostitution in order that they can provide for their needs with dignity and without the threat of exploitation, abuse or violence.<\/p><p> We also recommend regulation of the role of the Internet and social media in promoting pornography, prostitution and sex trafficking; the introduction of public awareness education and programmes to send out a clear message that prostitution is not acceptable; an interdepartmental approach with the Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, Social Protection and Education and Skills working in collaboration to deter demand; and that the many international instruments produced in the past 50 years on human trafficking, violence against women, discriminatory practices, gender equality and transnational crime to which Ireland has signed up and, in many cases, ratified - in particular, I would mention the Palermo Protocols and the Council of Europe convention - apply when drafting legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200016#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Sr. Mary Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355328600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank Sr. Ryan.

I am Maeve Lewis, executive director, and my colleague, Ms Julie Browne, is our advocacy officer.  I am also a psychotherapist with more than 20 years experience of working with survivors of sexual violence.<\/p><p>  All of our groups are present with a common purpose, namely, to ensure the review of legislation achieves the best possible outcome in terms of alleviating the harm caused to those engaged in prostitution, together with the achievement of the common good.  It is estimated that the sexual services of 1,000 men, women and children are bought in this country every day.  The majority of this activity takes place in private spaces, outside of the public domain.  The transactions are increasingly negotiated using new technologies, making them difficult to police.  The current system of criminal justice is not adequate to address the complexities of the sex trade, but the question of the best way forward is difficult to answer.  As such, the committee's work is important.<\/p><p>  My colleagues from the other organisations have been addressing various aspects of this question.  In the time allowed, I will focus my comments on the work done by One in Four in the field of sexual violence.  I will suggest that prostitution and trafficking must be understood as forms of sexual exploitation and, as such, form part of a continuum of sexual violence.<\/p><p>  One in Four is unique, in that we work with every aspect of sexual violence.  We offer counselling and advocacy services to men and women who were sexually abused in childhood and provide a sex offender treatment programme.  Each year, we work with approximately 1,000 people.<\/p><p>  Our clients have taught us a great deal about sexual violence.  We know the suffering that lies behind the statistics and understand that the impact of sexual violence in childhood reverberates throughout a person's life.  Our clients describe themselves as experiencing self-loathing and feeling contaminated and worthless.  They suffer endless shame, fear and guilt.  They tell us of how they try to self-soothe by using alcohol and drugs, often developing addiction problems in the process.  The majority meet the criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.   Some, both men and women, tell us of how they have worked in prostitution.<\/p><p>  We are all agreed that the prostitution of children is always wrong.  Equally, I am sure we all agree that the trafficking of women and children into sexual slavery is vile and undermines any notion of human rights and human dignity.<\/p><p>  On the other hand, it is often argued that adults have the right to choose to sell and buy sex freely and that sex between consenting adults should not be criminalised.  That is to misunderstand the nature of consent.  Research suggests that approximately two thirds of people working in prostitution have experienced sexual abuse in childhood.  What is termed \"consent\" or \"choice\" will often have been conditioned by the impact of that sexual abuse.  Prostitution reinforces the cycle of self-loathing and shame, causing further harm to the person's psychological and emotional well-being.  Our clients who have worked in prostitution tell us of being obliged to fake sexual pleasure, to engage in sexual acts they find degrading and distressing and, at times, being forced to perform unsafe sexual acts.  They also tell us of being raped and sexually assaulted and of believing that, as prostitutes, they had no recourse to the protection of the law.  Their testimony strongly indicates that we must view prostitution as a form of sexual violence and so-called choice as being anything but free.<\/p><p>  A review of international best practice shows that, as others have mentioned, there is no single approach that would provide a definitive model for Ireland to follow.  However, One in Four is persuaded that the Swedish model, which criminalises the buyers and those who organise the trade, provides the most promising roadmap.  While there are accusations of bias in the outcome research of the Swedish law, it would appear the number of people engaged in prostitution has decreased significantly, as has the number of people trafficked into Sweden.<\/p> <p>However, what is most striking in Sweden is the change in social attitudes to the buyers of sex, especially among younger men and women.<\/p><p> Our own experience tells us that legal changes can induce striking shifts in social attitudes.  Our drink-driving laws and same-sex marriage laws are but two examples of what extraordinary social change has followed legislative reform.  If prostitution were to be decriminalised in Ireland, as it was in the Netherlands, it is likely the sex industry would become normalised, demand would grow and immense harm would be caused to vulnerable men and women.  Conversely, criminalising the buyers and organisers would deepen awareness that prostitution is exploitative and damaging as well as helping to create a social norm that stigmatises the buyer rather than the prostituted person.<\/p><p> One in Four proposes that prostitution and trafficking is exploitative and harmful to vulnerable persons and is a form of sexual violence.  The most positive way forward would be to criminalise the buyers and organisers of the sex trade with a view to profoundly changing social attitudes to prostitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200017#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Lewis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355329200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Jennifer DeWan, campaign and communications officer at Nasc, the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200018#S00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355329200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee for inviting us today.  We welcome the review process and the opportunity for organisations and individuals to have a say in the development of new legislation that reflects the changing nature of prostitution.<\/p><p>  Nasc, the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, is a non-governmental organisation working for an integrated society based on the principles of human rights, social justice and equality.  Nasc, the Irish word for \"link\", works to link migrants to their rights by protecting human rights, promoting integration and campaigning for change.  Nasc was founded in 2000 in response to the rapid rise in the number of asylum seekers and migrant workers moving to the city of Cork.  It is the only NGO offering legal information and advocacy services to immigrants in Cork.  Nasc's legal team assists some 1,000 immigrants annually in navigating Ireland's protection, immigration and naturalisation systems.  We also assist migrants and ethnic-minority Irish people who encounter community-based and institutional racism as well as discrimination.<\/p><p>  Nasc is a member of the Turn Off the Red Light campaign and supports its call to criminalise the purchase of sex.  The information we present today is based on our written submission to the committee, which is in turn based on our experiences working with migrants, particularly in cases in which migrant women and children have been trafficked into Ireland for sexual exploitation.  We are especially concerned with how any new prostitution legislation will affect victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation as well as addressing their long-term needs for support and protection.<\/p><p>  As an NGO working with migrants, we focus our presentation on the situation of migrants in trafficking for sexual exploitation as it relates to the review of prostitution legislation.  Migration has had a significant impact on the sex industry globally and in Ireland.  The existing legislation does not reflect this global reality.  Migration and sexual exploitation are structurally linked.  Woman and children bear the brunt of this exploitation worldwide.  Numerous studies have shown that human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a means of supplying the sex industry, as up to 80% of people trafficked worldwide are destined for the sex industry.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, between 83% and 97% of people engaging in prostitution are believed to be migrant women and children.  At Nasc, we have provided support to victims and suspected victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation.  We also have extensive anecdotal evidence of the relationship between trafficking and sexual exploitation among migrant women and children in Ireland, particularly in Cork.  From this work, we are well aware of the limitations of the current legislation in combating trafficking and sexual exploitation and in providing the necessary supports and protections for victims.<\/p><p>  Depending on their cultural and ethnic backgrounds and their previous experiences, migrant women and children, both trafficked and non-trafficked, can be particularly vulnerable to poverty, social exclusion and sexual exploitation.  Victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation often do not know where to seek support, are fearful of disclosing their identities or situations and, in many cases, go underground rather than seek out help from the authorities or support services.  We believe the current conditions are not facilitating or promoting opportunities for identification and disclosure.  Accordingly, extremely vulnerable women and children are not receiving the appropriate protection and support.  Any changes to legislation must take these most vulnerable women and children into account and prioritise their needs, health and well-being.<\/p><p>  Nasc recommends in the review of the prostitution legislation the criminalisation of the purchase of all forms of sexual services along the lines of the Swedish model, with the corresponding removal of any legislation which targets the prostitute or victim of trafficking and sexual exploitation.  We also recommend that any changes relating to the criminalisation of prostitution be victim-centred and provide any other necessary reforms to trafficking legislation.  Trafficking must be dealt with as a human rights issue, not as an immigration issue, particularly with regard to residency, repatriation, co-operation in criminal investigations and so on.  Comprehensive victim-centred support and protection for victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking must be provided, and there must be ongoing consultation directly with victims of sexual exploitation, trafficking and sex workers.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the greatest success in the criminalisation of the purchase of sex in Sweden to date has been the apparent shift in public attitudes to prostitution and trafficking.  Prostitution and trafficking are not inevitable, unchangeable aspects of our society.  We can and must make changes in legislation, support services and attitudes with regard to the inhuman and degrading treatment of people that comes from turning a blind eye to the trading and purchase of people's bodies.  Any changes in legislation must be part of a comprehensive, victim-centred approach that provides support and protection for victims of sexual exploitation, especially victims who have been trafficked into this country illegally and who have likely experienced tremendous physical, mental and emotional suffering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200018#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer DeWan"},{"type":"speech","time":1355329200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Ms DeWan and invite Mr. Liam Doran, general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200018#S00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355329200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for affording us the opportunity to make this presentation and engage with it on this critical issue.<\/p><p>  The INMO is a registered professional trade union which provides a full range of services to more than 40,000 nurse and midwife members.  We are affiliated to several national and international organisations, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Women's Council and the International Council of Nurses.  Our membership is 95% female.<\/p><p>  Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy gave the keynote address at the INMO annual conference and received a standing ovation from the 350 nurses and midwives who steadfastly endorsed her position on prostitution and trafficking.  The conference adopted a motion of support for the Turn Off the Red Light campaign and called for the introduction of legislation to prosecute buyers of sex.  Many other unions have since joined the campaign.  The ICTU women's conference and biennial conference carried resolutions condemning prostitution and trafficking.<\/p><p>  The INMO rejects in the strongest terms the idea that prostitution is inevitable.  It is a common clich&eacute; to refer to prostitution as the oldest profession in the world.  However, this does not address the physical, mental and emotional suffering that is endured by women in prostitution.  The position of the INMO is clear.  It is unacceptable for someone to buy another person's body for sexual gratification, exploiting the poverty, past history of abuse or limited life choices of the person being bought.  It is gross exploitation which is almost always imposed by men upon women in pursuit of financial gain.<\/p><p>  The Irish sex industry is lucrative and has an estimated value of more than &euro;180 million per annum, thus explaining why it is of such growing interest to many.  There are more than a thousand women available through the Internet and involved with indoor prostitution.  Ireland is a destination country for trafficked women, with a staggering 97% of women available through the Internet being migrants.  Many trafficked women are recruited with promises of employment opportunities, often in the hotel industry.  Their difficult life-related situations are used as a pathway to a better life when, in reality, they are being condemned to a life of slavery.<\/p><p>  The argument that women make a choice to enter prostitution does not stand up to scrutiny.  The situation whereby adults, in the absence of any degree of control, duress or lack of alternatives, agree to exchange sex for money seldom occurs.  This is not about those rare situations but about those situations where the woman has no control and is used as little more than an object for gratification.  The suggestion that the position held by many of the groups here is not evidence-based is erroneous.  These are the groups that work face-to-face with these vulnerable people, and they must be listened to by the committee.  They know what is wrong and what needs to be done to arrest prostitution.  Any claims from those not on the front line of this problem should not swing the committee's review of the proposed legislation.  What needs to be done is that the purchaser of sex needs to be criminalised.<\/p><p>  Legislation can change attitudes, as is evident from the smoking ban and drink-driving initiatives.  Prostitution is exploitative and incompatible with equality.<\/p> <p>As a female dominated trade union, we believe this is a most compelling argument to introduce legislation that supports gender equality.  This industry is about men, money and menace, nothing more, nothing less.<\/p><p> The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is firmly of the view that any attempt to form a prostitutes trade union would be naive in the extreme and merely give credibility to the mistaken belief engaging in prostitution is a choice.  It is not possible to justify calling it a job, given the extreme exploitation and the tremendous physical and emotional damage women involved in prostitution suffer.  There is no doubt that such women need significant support, including support to exit prostitution.  As part of this process, the Government should ensure sufficient funding is available to the appropriate NGOs to provide such support.<\/p><p> Some advocates believe the total decriminalisation of prostitution, together with the medicalisation of the sex industry with mandatory check-ups and screening for prostitutes, would protect women and provide for more favourable health outcomes.  Such an approach would only serve to legitimise prostitution via the health care system and should only be viewed as consumer protection for the buyer.  It would do little to protect the health of women and be nothing more than a veneer of apparent respectability for a despicable industry.<\/p><p> Prostitution has a devastating impact on both the physical and mental well-being of those prostituted.  It erodes self-esteem and self-confidence and can cause depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.  The repeated violation of the vulnerable female body for the profit or satisfaction of others is wrong and will always be so.  The physical health consequences include bruises, broken bones, black eyes, concussion and many more.  Sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, herpes, human papilla virus and syphilis, are all prevalent.  Infertility, often caused by sexually transmitted diseases, is also evident.  Research shows that mortality in prostitution is ten times higher than in the general population.  Those involved in prostitution face beatings, rape, assault and degrading treatment.  This is the real outcome of prostitution and far removed from the picture painted by those who should know better and those who profit from this industry.  Melissa Farley has identified that the trauma sustained by women and girls involved in prostitution is akin to and occurs at the same rate as that suffered by soldiers who have participated in combat.  Such a finding is reason enough for immediate action to protect women involved in prostitution against such violation of their human rights.<\/p><p> As a female dominated trade union, the INMO is deeply concerned at the growth of the sex industry, the subsequent and undeniable growing exploitation of women and the repercussions for all women in society.  Ireland must legislate to criminalise the purchaser of sex, while also strengthening the penalties imposed on those who profit from this grossly exploitative trade.  The comment about the Garda and the availability of resources is valid, but it cannot be used to inhibit change.  If we wait for the Garda to have sufficient resources to implement every law, we will be waiting for snow in Havana.  We need to do this now.  Penalty points were brought forward to stop motorists speeding.  These laws must be brought forward to deter people from engaging in the exploitation of women for their own satisfaction or profit.  Our legislators must have the courage to act now to protect these vulnerable women and offer them some hope of a real life in which they can be free from their terrible nightmare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200018#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355329800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Doran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2012121200019#T00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1355329800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank all of the delegations for their presentations and patience.

I found myself reading more of them because I did not have a chance to read the document beforehand.  Those involved are dealing with a despicable type of human being who does not get the reason the women concerned are there.

No one in the committee would disagree with Ruhama's analysis of the impact on the mental and physical health of the vast majority of women involved.<\/p><p>  My questions relate to some of my concerns.  If we put in place or advocate for legislation which criminalises the user and the Government brings it through, how will we ensure the poor women, for the most part, who are still locked in will be adequately protected?  The arguments we have heard against the Swedish model suggest it forces women in that situation to work with even worse men than those about whom we have read in the comments quoted.  The concern is that they might be forced to take more risks and put themselves in more danger.  I understand the point made by Mr. Doran to the effect that one must create the environment before one can deal with it and enforce the issue.  I am keen to hear some thoughts from the delegations on how we can ensure this.  Many of those in the delegations work on the front line and deal with the implications.

Were legislation to be passed and enacted, one would come to the question of putting it into operation and making it relevant to the people affected by it.

I am upfront in saying the naming and shaming in an Irish cultural context is a vital part of this.  We must ensure the people concerned are seen for what they are.  I am referring to those who exploit the weak and the vulnerable.<\/p> <p>By this means we can reduce the number who do that.

I cannot see why we could not vest in a county mayor the same confidence we vest in a county manager or director of services.  It seems to be a bridge too far.  While we talk about the need to enhance the role and power of local authorities, when it comes to taking legislative steps, we constantly seek to exclude them from as many processes as possible.  This is excluding local authority members from access to information which might ultimately be in the interest of the local community.<\/p><p> One could understand a situation where sensitive issues arise, for example, in respect of a Civil Defence member's health, which is not listed in the legislation as something that would be recorded.  Were that to arise, I am sure it would be possible to have information that would be somewhat readily available and information that would be retained.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2012121200004#CC00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1355316600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>We are talking about volunteers and not paid employees of the Department of Defence.

I thought it would useful to the committee for the authors of that review, Mr. Rob Morrison, former head of news and current affairs at UTV and Mr. Steve Carson, director of programmes in RTE, to also attend this morning to answer, along with us, any questions the committee may have regarding their review and report.  Before coming to the committee's questions, however, I want to give it a clear sense of how RTE has reacted to the serious mistakes and misjudgments made in this programme and what actions we have taken.<\/p><p>  In March, responding to the decision by the BAI to uphold complaints taken by Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher and others against RTE arising from &quot;The Frontline&quot; presidential election debate programme, I expressed RTE's deep regret at the failures identified by the BAI and apologised on behalf of RTE to Mr. Gallagher, both on television and radio, as well as in a written statement.  In addition, it was then, on foot of the BAI's decision and concerns expressed elsewhere, that we commissioned a full review of the programme.<\/p><p>  The review team was selected carefully to provide the appropriate mix of external independence on the one hand and knowledge of RTE's practices and procedures on the other.  Both Mr. Morrison and Mr. Carson are very experienced and while it makes for difficult reading for me and for everyone in RTE, I am very grateful for the diligence and thoroughness by which they carried out this review.  The review was completed and presented to our board in June.  It was shared with the BAI, as agreed, for its consideration in July.  There were then a number of exchanges and queries over the coming months, and it was published two weeks ago.  It is the first time in RTE history that such an editorial report, involving an external independent author, has been commissioned and published.  On publication of the report, Mr. Kevin Bakhurst, our new managing director of news and current affairs, apologised again to Mr. Gallagher, all the other candidates and the audience for the mistakes that occurred in the programme.<\/p><p>  What happened in this programme, coming so soon after what happened in the &quot;Mission to Prey&quot; programme, has had a profound impact on RTE.  Over many years, RTE has earned and retained the trust of its audiences through great programming and an adherence to very high editorial standards.  Nowhere has this been more so than in news and current affairs.  The very serious editorial failures made in these two current affairs programmes have rightly caused RTE to review and interrogate all of its editorial policy, practices and values.  These errors and failures have presented many challenges to many people in recent months, not least to those who were directly affected by them, but they have also caused concern and anger, both within RTE and among its audience, the public, whose trust in the organisation we value above all else.<\/p><p>  RTE must always be open and honest when it get things wrong.  In any given week our editors, programme makers and journalists make thousands of decisions which influence public debate and discussion.  We will make mistakes.  To expect that we will always get these judgments completely right is to pretend that these judgments are easy and obvious, and to ignore the possibility of human error.  What is critical, though, is that we learn what we can from those mistakes and make whatever changes are necessary.  This is part of being accountable and is essential to public trust and public support.<\/p><p>  The critical first part of that is to understand what went wrong.  That is what the review into this programme was about and what it did in meticulous detail.  It addresses all the critical issues - the format of the programme, the audience selection, the framing of questions and the editorial management of the programme.  It benchmarked the approach taken in this programme to the approaches taken by other broadcasters of similar programmes.  Finally, having clearly identified the shortcomings in the programme, it made very clear recommendations for RTE as to how best to conduct future debate programmes of this kind so that the mistakes are not repeated.  We have implemented all those recommendations already.<\/p><p>  It is worth outlining all the changes that we have implemented in RTE in recent months in response to what happened in these two programmes.  RTE has completely re-structured the editorial management of RTE television current affairs; over the past few months, RT&Eacute; has made a number of significant new appointments to its news and current affairs division and there are more new appointments to follow; RT&Eacute; has completely rewritten its journalism guidelines for all editorial staff; new social media guidelines are now part of the new journalism guidelines; all editorial staff from across the organisation have attended training sessions on the new guidelines; RT&Eacute; has established a new editorial standards board, the purpose of which is to help maintain and monitor content standards through regular review of programmes and regular consultation with editors and programme makers; RT&Eacute; has put in place a new process for dealing with significant editorial complaints; and in the new year, we are putting in place a new system to better track and monitor the range and diversity of on-air contributors and panellists on all of our radio and television programmes.  Notwithstanding, and not underestimating for a second, the very significant criticisms that the BAI made in its statement of 22 November, it is important to note the BAI stated that its compliance committee:<blockquote>is satisfied that RT&Eacute; has taken significant steps to address the issues that have arisen from the production of this programme. Furthermore, the broadcaster has publicly committed to implementing these changes. While the efficacy of the changes will only become apparent over time, it is the Compliance Committee's view that the broadcaster has seriously engaged in making the changes necessary to prevent a reoccurrence of the mistakes evident in key aspects of the production... .<\/blockquote>All of the changes we have made are just steps in the right direction but I would hope that the range of measures we have introduced clearly shows RTE's determination to learn from its mistakes and to make its journalism stronger, fairer and more transparent.<\/p><p>  It is also important for the committee to be aware that all of these changes to our journalism have been implemented through a period of enormous change for the organisation as a whole.  At the beginning of last year, RTE was forecasting a deficit of &euro;30 million.  Having taken a number of difficult decisions, including reducing staff numbers by 20%, we are now on target to regain financial stability next year.  In the past 12 months, we also successfully launched SAORVIEW, on time and on budget, allowing the Exchequer to net hundreds of millions of euro from spectrum sell off.  We have restructured our digital offerings, re-focussed our commercial enterprises and tackled a number of thorny issues, including that of fees paid to presenters with their co-operation.<\/p> <p>Early next year we will publish a comprehensive strategy document for the organisation that will set out a very different future for RTE, while also looking critically at everything we now do and how we could do it better.  Most important, all of these changes have happened while we have maintained the quality and breadth of our services to the public from the Olympics and European Championships to the drama \"Love\/Hate\", but in the end, everything comes back to the audience and the trust they have in us.  All this positive change should not deflect us from the mistakes we have made and how we can learn from them.  I know the high standards that are rightly expected of us.  I believe that the majority of RTE output meets those standards.  I also know that public trust is essential for any media organisation, but especially for RTE as a public service broadcaster.<\/p><p> RTE produces more than 40 hours of current affairs programming across our radio and television services each week.  It is at the heart of our output.  It is our daily connection with the lives of our audience and public life in this country.  I am fully aware that the significant changes we have made to strengthen our journalism will mean little unless they are embraced by all managerial and editorial staff and acted upon in the thousands of editorial decisions we make every day.  They will only work if programme makers from the most junior to the highest level clearly understand and accept their responsibility and their role in rebuilding RTE's reputation for very high quality journalism.  Most of all though, it is through great programming that we will rebuild trust with our audiences because not alone do our audiences expect us to be accurate and fair, they also expect that we will not lose our nerve and that we continue to challenge, to probe and to ask the difficult questions in the public interest.

The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland noted it was a thorough review.  It was based on interviews with all the members of \"The Frontline\" team, the former editor of current affairs, the previous head of \"The Frontline\" and approximately 20 members of the studio audience.  We talked to executives from other broadcasters.  We reviewed extensive programme files, people's notebooks, e-mail exchanges and we looked at records of texts that had been sent to that programme and other programmes.  We interviewed some members of the team twice to cross-reference information we had gathered and to probe areas of concern that had been thrown up by the research.  We looked not only at the questions that had been broadcast but at other questions that had been prepared and not broadcast.  We even looked at social media activity after the broadcast and that was a mark of the thoroughness with which we wanted to approach this.<\/p><p>  The terms of reference were straightforward: to look at the processes, how the questions were devised, how the audience members were selected and to what extent this was different from the standard for \"The Frontline\" or to what extent this compared with similar programmes.  We did not look at the issue of the tweet on the basis that this had been ruled on by the BAI and was the subject of a separate personnel disciplinary investigation at the time.  Mr. Morrison will talk though our basic findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Carson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355305200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>We came up with conclusions to the editorial review after what Mr. Carson has described as an in-depth research period and a substantial investigation, and we made a number of recommendations to RTE to address the issues and to prevent it happening again in similar programmes in the future.  The headline findings were largely to do with the origination of the questions and the make up of the audience.  That was where most of the problems lay.<\/p><p>  There were a number of questions around the derivation of the questions and the balance to those asked of the candidates in the programme.  The most serious omission from the questions was, once the team had decided they would ask each member of the panel at least one challenging question, for some reason, no direct challenging question was asked of Michael D. Higgins from the audience.<\/p><p>  We found a number of things about which we are unhappy.  First, the format of the programme was very confused and much too complicated.  They had what we call a roadmap of questions.  Normally, for a programme of that length, there might be ten or 12 questions in the roadmap but this had up to 50 questions.  The situation was, therefore, very confused on the night.  It was not helped by the worst weather in living memory and when it came to it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200004#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rob Morrison"},{"type":"speech","time":1355305200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Please allow everybody a chance.

This is an important point from the report.  It required somebody to be there solely to watch the programme on transmission to ensure all compliance issues and all issues around balance were addressed.  That person was not there for the entire programme and if the person had been there, he or she would surely have seen that no question was addressed to Michael D. Higgins.  That was a definite failing and it is one of our key recommendations.<\/p><p>  There were other issues around allegations of people being given questions to ask and having questions written for them.  Again, there was a complicated system for backup questioners.  We only found one person, again as a result of the floods, who was given a question to ask that was not theirs.  In others words, they had not written it; it had been written by a person who had not turned up.  Even still, we considered that inappropriate and wrong.  Questions were swapped where people were not expected to turn up and people were brought in off the substitutes bench.  They maybe had a question and they were asked to swap their question for another question.  It was again absolutely unnecessarily complicated and that was inappropriate at least.<\/p><p>  There is a certain degree of redrafting of questions because of legal issues or because the question is too long.  This happens on all programmes.  It was not unique to this programme.  Most programmers to whom we spoke, from the BBC in London and UTV, said quite a lot of redrafting of questions goes on but not to the point where they are rewritten.  We found in the report that it came much closer to rewriting than we would like.  However, we did not find any evidence - and this was a judgment - that a question had been written by the production team for a member of the public.<\/p><p>  We concluded that the method of selection of the audience, given it was a presidential election debate, was inappropriate.  It would have been appropriate for a regular edition and I have worked on similar style programmes to \"The Frontline\".<\/p><p>  With regard to other issues, we found that training was poor.<\/p> <p>We also found that awareness of RTE editorial guidelines was low.

We also say in our recommendations that it is not appropriate to have personal friends of the production team or people with a connection to a party running a candidate in an election programme.<\/p><p>  Mr. Morrison and I have discussed how this could happen.  The reality is that a series of mistakes which interacted with each other were made by a series of people.  The weather played a part.  If some of these things had happened in isolation, we would not have had the cumulative failure we did have.  We noted that there were gaps in experience in the report.  It was a relatively inexperienced team working to an unclear brief for which one needs to look to senior management in current affairs.  We found that the overall steering committee in RTE received some reports about what the plan was and was aware that the audience selection format was changed from \"The Frontline\" programme on the general election in March and approved that.  We concluded that it was not an appropriate format.  RTE has run two editions of \"The Frontline\" on the fiscal treaty and children's referendum that have been compliant.  In future, the steering committee needs to get far more detail and perhaps be more probing about what the format is.  That essentially covers what we found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200005#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Carson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355305800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>In conclusion, we would quantify these mistakes as significant.

We are reviewing a report by RTE and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on the \"The Frontline\" programme conducted to elect the President of the Republic of Ireland.  No greater honour can be bestowed on anyone than to be elected Head of State of the Republic of Ireland.  The programme and report reveal extreme shortcomings.  Mr. Morrison and Mr. Carson spoke to the teams, checked the notebooks and spoke to the staff.  The referee on the night was Pat Kenny.  Do they find it odd that he was not asked for his opinion on what happened on the floor of the programme?  It is like a football match where one interviews the water carriers, sideline people and umpires but forgets to interview the referee.<\/p><p>  I hope that in trying to answer the committee's questions, RTE will not refer to the weather because the weather has an adverse effect on many occupations, none more so than this year.  I do not think RTE was baling silage on 24 October.  Surely the delegation will not come up with the junior infants'-style excuse that the weather had something to do with the carrying of the programme.  RTE is a television station in existence for over 50 years that is supposed to be at the top of its game in respect of technology.  An RTE delegation gave the committee its expertise in respect of SAORVIEW.  It is not acceptable or believable to imagine that the Irish people would believe that RTE could not verify a tweet live on air or explain it the next morning or in any of the reports.  The report has not clearly stated who sanctioned the fake tweet.  Who decided not to include the corrective tweet?  The argument has been made that communication broke down.  RTE is a serious broadcaster of long standing and I do not accept this argument.  <\/p><p>  The delegation spoke about how seriously it takes public broadcasting.  It faces two major issues this year relating to \"Prime Time\" and this edition of \"The Frontline\".  There is considerable scrutiny of what is going on in RTE.  There should be an independent audit of a range of programmes going back over the years instead of a report by RTE.  Such an independent report would examine programmes going back ten, 15 or 20 years to see whether an agenda exists in RTE.  A perception exists among people on that particular edition of \"The Frontline\" that an agenda existed on that night and this argument has not be disproved.  <\/p><p>  It is not longer acceptable for RTE to decide the format of televised election and referenda debates.  We should be looking for an independent commission to decide on the format of these debates.  Election to any public office is an honour in any republic and it cannot be besmirched by shabby programming or excuses relating to weather.  It is not acceptable.  The only way to go is to have an independent broadcasting commission for all debates on elections.  RTE is the State broadcaster paid for by the licence fee.  In a republic, the aim is for the State broadcaster to be independent but RTE standards in respect of this programme left much to be desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200005#E01000","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1355305800,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I ask members to stick to questions because that is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200005#E01100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1355305800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I will stick to questions as much as possible but I acknowledge and welcome the attendance of the delegation from RTE and its presentation.  I also acknowledge its efforts subsequent to the review it is putting in place.  We are here this morning because there was no sense of balance in that edition of \"The Frontline\" and because it is important that we give balance to what actions have been taken.<\/p><p>  The reason the delegation is here this morning is because the BAI criticised it for not publishing the full document upon which the report was based.  That evoked suspicion not only among this committee but among the general public as if there was something in that longer document that was not released.  I acknowledge the fact that RTE has published that document.  As the delegation stated, RTE's inquiry into the programme dealt with how the audience and questions were selected.  There is a reference in the document to the inexperience - perhaps I am using the wrong word - of the editorial team.  The perception among the public has been confirmed in the longer document where it was stated that following the general election debate involving the party leaders, the editor thought the programme was a bit stilted but that editorial safety was his main concern.  <\/p> <p> I put it to the witnesses that, for this reason, someone decided to stir the pot for the presidential debate so that it would not be so stilted.  Some of the candidates, including the candidate who led in the opinion polls going into the debate, Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher, were casualties of this decision.  If the idea was to target him for more questions because he was the leader, it is interesting that the candidate in second place was asked no questions.  This is one of the public's concerns.<\/p><p> The other public concern is that presidential and general election debates seem to be competitions between the top presenters within and without RTE, who are paid considerable fees, to get the largest audiences and to be the most controversial.  Truth and balance become lost.  I would be interested in the witnesses' comments in this regard.  It is the overriding belief among the public that, be the presenter Pat Kenny, Miriam O'Callaghan or someone else, everyone wants to trump everyone else.  As the debate in question was the final one, there was a perception that the candidates, the truth and a sense of balance were casualties.<\/p><p> It has been stated that all of RTE's staff have done social media courses.  Presenters in RTE and other broadcasters have Twitter accounts on which they make personal comments.  Given some of those comments in recent weeks, it is difficult to see how they would give certain individuals fair interviews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200005#E01200","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355306400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs clarification on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200006#F00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1355306400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Yes.

The references to the weather do not mean that the studio was leaking or so on.  Rather, they related to the number of people who did not turn up at short notice.  As an experienced broadcaster, we should have coped with that problem.  We are not making excuses.  We do these debates well and have done them for a long time.  We should have had contingencies for this problem, but we did not.  The references are not meant to use the weather as a lame excuse.  Many people did not turn up at the last minute.  On such a big night with so many candidates, this created an added degree of disarray.  We should have dealt with it.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Deputy's referral to the debates commission, we are open to having discussions about how debates are done.  RTE used to be the only broadcaster that did debates.  Other broadcasters now do them.  We are open to having positive discussions with whoever.  The experience of commissions elsewhere is mixed.  America has the Commission on Presidential Debates, CPD.  Although it is an independent, non-profit organisation, it is effectively controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties.  The CPD discusses a 32-page contract on how to carry out the debates with the parties.  Eighteen pro-democracy groups took legal action against the CPD at the last election and candidates of smaller parties have continually stated that they have been excluded.  It is a non-profit, separate corporation, but it was founded by the two main parties.  Canada examined the idea of a commission and decided not to have one.<\/p><p>  The UK has pursued an approach whereby the broadcasters and three political parties agree a 75-page document that is published in advance.  This was the first time it was done and people were conservative in their approach to it.  Negotiating such a contract would be difficult.  I have negotiated three leaders' debates.  They took up more of my time than any other programme that I have ever put together.  Given that we have five parties, a strong independent sector, a range of broadcasters and a regulator, a commission would be complicated.  This does not mean it would be impossible or that RTE will only do this work one way.<\/p><p>  There is almost no country in which people are satisfied with debates.  Many complaints were made about the moderator during the pivotal debate in the last election.  When the UK used an audience research company, ICM, 80% of the audience had effectively shown party affiliations while 20% were unaffiliated.  Only yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron stated that he believed that the debate structure needed to be changed, as it was sterile and boring and the public did not engage properly with it.<\/p><p>  There is no perfect system.  In RTE's defence, we have been running debates for a long time and, as far as I am aware, no serious complaints or issues have arisen concerning them, including our debates on the fiscal treaty and children's referenda.  I will give the committee a sense of how our approach has changed.  There were 26 people from the \"Yes\" side and 27 people from the \"No\" side in the audience of our \"The Frontline\" programme on the children's rights referendum.  We took ten audience questions, five from the \"Yes\" side and five from the \"No\" side.  The difference in time allocated to both sides for their answers was 36 seconds in a 33-minute segment of the programme.  We are learning.  Perfection is not a virtue that I have ever claimed for RTE, but we have done debates well in the past.  This does not rule us out from engaging positively and proactively in any new debate on how to run them.<\/p><p>  We will publish more information on our approach in advance of future debates.  We hold many discussions with political parties.  Understandably, they have different views on debates.  Often, these depend on how well they believe candidates will do.  That is a natural decision.<\/p><p>  Regarding the independent audit, the reputable Press Ombudsman examined our procedures as a result of the \"Mission to Prey\" programme.  We have implemented each of his recommendations.  Another reputable external contributor was involved in this report and we have implemented all of the recommendations.  The quality of our journalism and our approach to news and current affairs is not reflected in the two reports on the programmes in question.  One cannot do 40 hours of news and current affairs live every week in the white heat of election debates and not encounter problems every week.<\/p> <p>We also have huge internal checks and balances, which did not work in this instance.  That is why we have put in place new systems for the future.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned going back 15 or 20 years to consider programmes properly.  There was a Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, investigation into \"Mission to Prey\" and although the investigator moved incredibly quickly, it still took seven months rather than the indicated two months.  Due process takes a considerable amount of time, as the BBC is now finding out.  It launched an investigation into \"Newsnight\" which it indicated would be done in four weeks and although we are two months into that, we still have not seen the end product.  Going back 15 or 20 years, involving people who have left the organisation and moved on, is not necessary.  In the opening statement I mentioned that these programmes have had a profound effect on RTE and we are moving on and making changes.  People should judge us on how we react to those changes.<\/p><p> The BAI criticised us for not publishing the working document.  There has been much understandable commentary about stand-offs involving RTE and the BAI in this regard.  The BAI compliance committee, led by Mr. Chris Morash, whom I have never met, does a very fair job, although it is difficult.  I agree with some of its decisions and strongly disagree with some, which is to be expected.  It does a difficult and important, although sometimes thankless, job.  We had a difficulty with the wording in its statement regarding the difference between the two documents.  I will not get into that here.<\/p><p> We also felt that if we had known we would be asked to publish the working document, we could have got clearance in advance.  We did not know that and we saw 20 minutes before the press that this request would come through.  We knew we would be asked to publish the report and we agreed to do it.  We never said that we would not publish the working document.  As soon as we saw the statement, we met immediately as a group and considered how to get the approvals to get out the working document.  This is not a big stand-off between RTE and the regulator, and we have no issue with the idea that RTE must be regulated.  If people make complaints, they cannot be dealt with just by RTE and there should be recourse if public money is used.  Although I disagree with some of the judgments made by the compliance committee, as I would, it does a very fair job on the whole.<\/p><p> I will bring in Mr. Bakhurst and Ms Duignan in on the issue of social media.  I will come back to any questions I have forgotten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200006#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355307000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>We are seeking clarification on the tweeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200007#G00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355307000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>The tweet was not included in this report because the BAI had already ruled on it.

I am pleased to be here.  Social media is a real issue for any public service broadcaster or any broadcaster that wants to maintain the trust of an audience in the impartial approach to news and current affairs.  Social media has become an inherent part of what we do around the world and it is a source of amazing material that we would not get otherwise from our audience and also from conflict zones like Syria, where it is very difficult for journalists to operate properly.  We need a system to deal with social media.<\/p><p>  We deal with social media as a source of material, and as Deputy Moynihan noted, it is critical that we know how to deal with it.  It was completely unacceptable that the tweet in question got to air and I like to think that will never happen again in a debate like that.  We must have the right systems and level of knowledge in place in dealing with social media, which is fast evolving.<\/p><p>  While we receive material via social media it is also an important way for us to put out content, and some of the RTE accounts are quite successful in doing this through Twitter etc.  Personal use is probably the thorniest area, and we already have some strict guidelines within RTE.  I have no doubt that the people who work for us know exactly how seriously we take those guidelines, and we have recently ensured that everybody has read and signed both journalism and social media guidelines.  I have stated clearly that if people have not read and signed them, they should not be working for us.<\/p><p>  This is a constantly evolving field.  We have done training in social media and I have commissioned one of the best social media trainers I know to come in again in the new year to do a few new sessions.  The field is constantly changing and we take it extremely seriously.

We support and expect independence and unbiased broadcasting.  We would agree with the statement that the audience expects that RTE will not lose its nerve and will continue to challenge and probe.  For a democracy it is important that RTE continue to do that.<\/p><p> However, I shall set the context.  There is no doubt that the tweet should not have been broadcast and that there was plenty of opportunity on the night to identify that it was a fake tweet.

The electorate made up its own mind when voting and I respect its democratic decision.  <\/p><p> My first question is the most obvious.  Did no one in RTE have the savvy to know that the programme was a potential minefield?  Surely somebody should have.  The delegation said that no senior editorial person designated to deal with that aspect of the show.  Such a person should have been provided.  Can we have the editorial criteria for the selection of topics, panellists and audience members for general shows of \"The Frontline\"?  It is disturbing - I would like to know how common it is - that friends or acquaintances of the production team are invited to join shows such as this.  What is the selection criteria used for audience members with regard to political leanings or affiliations, sex, age group and geographical area?  There is a view that Dublin 4 is well represented but not the rest of the country.  Is the socioeconomic background taken into account when it comes to the selection of audience members?  <\/p><p> Mr. Curran stated in his report that this is the first time in the history of RTE that such an editorial report, involving an external independent author, had been commissioned and published.

I have a couple of questions on the preparation of the report.  I do not want to question the professional integrity of Mr. Steve Carson or Mr. Rob Morrison in any way.  There could be a perception - there is in some quarters - that the two gentlemen have RTE connections.<\/p><p>  I have a question for Mr. Curran on the investigation team.  Did he have a concern that a perception might emanate from the investigation team that it was effectively RTE investigating itself?  Mr. Curran stated that he wanted it to be external and independent but it is hard to see how the investigation can be viewed as independent.  Let us do a comparison with the <font color=\"#222222\">Savita Halappanavar case.  It led to a lot of discussion and debate in this country and within RTE's current affairs and news department.  RTE was correct to pursue the Government from that perspective.  As a result, a significant change was made to the make-up of the investigation team into that case.  The consultants from Galway were removed from the panel.  Again, I am not questioning their integrity but it would have been wholly inappropriate had those people remained on the investigation and cast a shadow over it.  <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  Mr. Curran also said that much of the problem seems to revolve around the fact that there was nobody really in charge on the night.  He has been around RTE for a long time and knows how things work.  Was he surprised at the dysfunctional chain of command that existed on that programme?  Was he aware that there was such a junior team working on it?  RTE seems to be using the defence that there was a haphazard approach and dysfunctional operation in place.  I shall have another question on bias later.  The excuse given was that RTE was all over the place.  The weather was also thrown in as an inconsequential factor but it played into the excuse.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  With regard to the programme, people ran around in a haphazard and dysfunctional manner without an appropriate management structure in place.  I imagine that there should have been a chain of command above that level that should have been aware.  Ultimately, Mr. Curran should have been aware of the situation.  If he was not, then the line of command between him and further down the tree is not effective.  What has he done to address the matter? <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  I have a question on bias.  One of the conclusions states: &quot;<\/font>The review team did not find evidence of bias or partiality from the presenter or production team, and said the mistakes made in the programme were not the result of bias&quot;.<font color=\"#222222\">  I ask Mr. Carson and Mr. Morrison to take us through how the review team reached that conclusion.  In doing so, they might address the first question asked by Ms Siobh&aacute;n Feely on the night.  She asked: &quot;<\/font>lt's for the whole panel.  What do they think it says about the country that just after eight months after we ejected Fianna F&aacute;il from office, an ex\u00adFianna F&aacute;il businessman looks set to be our next President?&quot;.  Perhaps there is still a defence of a haphazard approach, nobody knew what was going on and researchers were ringing around to get people to ask questions on the day.<\/p><p>  I am a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy but I need help to understand.  Please help me to conclude that there was not an effort to set a particular agenda.  Let us not forget what the first question was.  It was directed at the entire panel and not to one individual candidate.  It effectively set the tone against one candidate and allowed each of the other candidates to take a pop at him from the outset.  I am not a conspiracy theorist.  I generally do not buy into some of the commentary that circulated in my own party that believes that every organ of the media is against it because I have a great respect for the media, and in particular for RTE in the role that it has played as a public broadcaster.  Can somebody help me to understand how RTE can conclude that there was no bias in the way the first question was presented?  It was the first question, so it set the tone and I think that it points to a bias.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200008#H00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1355307600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I wish to return to what Deputy Moynihan asked at the start of the meeting.  I have a simple question.  My mind was not changed on the night in question and it was obvious for whom I was going to vote for.  The committee must ask two questions.  How many people changed their minds that night due to the programme?  Did it have an impact on the election result?  I believe the result of the election was changed in consequence.  From a public service broadcast point of view it calls into question, as Deputy Moynihan has done, the management of elections, the relationship between the media and electioneering and how an election will be operated in the future.<br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Let us contrast the manner in which debates have been conducted for referenda commissions and how they convey information.  The contrast could not be starker.  If one contrasts the Irish presidential election broadcast ambit with its American counterpart the contrast could not be more obvious.<\/font><\/p> <p>In the American situation one does not have the type of audience hijacking, as I would call it, as when somebody is standing for election in Ireland, be it in a general election, by-election or European election, where there would be a national interest.  It certainly calls on us as legislators and the public service broadcaster, which is in receipt of the licence fee, to examine how to get fairness into the system and to restore trust.  Those are the fundamental issues.  What is in place now to ensure this does not happen again?  If somebody is interviewed on \"Prime Time\" or some other programme on television or radio and there is a spurious tweet or text message from Mary from Dungloe, she could be one's constituency colleague and could do irreparable damage.  It is a very pertinent question.  What safeguards are in place to ensure that does not happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200008#H00500","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355308200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Donovan raised a very important question about the presidential election being called into question.  That is possibly the most significant question anybody could raise today.  A colleague was interviewed on the radio and gave a personal opinion about that.  I feel it is really important.  That colleague was asked a question and gave their opinion.  They were not speaking for RTE but they gave their opinion.  People are entitled to their opinion.  I do not know how one can say that this programme decided the outcome of the election.  It was watched by 700,000 people, but 1.8 million people voted in the election.  That means 1.1 million people did not see the programme.  Mr. Gallagher appeared on &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; the following morning, which had an audience of 230,000 people.  He appeared on the &quot;Six One News&quot; the following evening and while he was on air the audience was 600,000 people.  I do not know if that had an influence.  Matt Cooper of &quot;The Last Word&quot; covered this and Vincent Browne did a full programme on it.  The newspapers gave it wall to wall coverage for days.  Did that have an influence?  I cannot say; I do not know.<\/p><p>  Also, consider what happened in the days just before the election.  The last opinion polls were on 22 and 23 October, the ReDC poll for the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i> and the MRBI poll for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Mr. Gallagher was at 40% and Mr. Higgins, as he was then, was at 25% and 26%.  There was a swing of 12% away from Mr. Gallagher and a swing of 14% to Mr. Higgins, but that 14% swing could have gone 3% to another candidate, 2% to another and 1% to somebody else.  It did not, and that cannot be attributed to a single programme.  Frankly, people inside and outside the media sometimes exaggerate the influence we have.  I am not saying the programme did not have an impact and did not impact on the election at that time, but it is difficult to say that everything else that was happening in those two days and the amount of media coverage elsewhere could be attributed to that single programme.  I cannot say that because I do not know, and I do not think we will ever know.<\/p><p>  As regards the other issues raised, our goal is to get fairness and trust.  I have already answered Deputy Moynihan.  His suggestion of having debates about how we handle presidential debates in future is timely.  We will engage positively and constructively in that.  Personally, I have misgivings about the American commission system, where two political parties control an organisation that negotiates a 32 page contract with the two political parties.  That would be a difficulty for me.  However, there are different ways of looking at and doing this and we will engage in whatever debate takes place.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's question about how we can ensure that this does not happen again, we have already implemented the recommendations from Rob Morrison and Steve Carson.  Following on from them, I have had discussions with the new managing editor of current affairs as part of that structure and accept his recommendations.  He is already of the opinion that we will use a polling company for the selection of the audience at the next election.  The Morrison-Carson recommendations suggested that as an option, but he is already inclined to do that.  He will see that the audience is as democratically and politically representative as possible, and he will have three people on a panel, one of whom will be external, which will decide the questions.  He intends to introduce a range of changes.  We will be far more open about the format in advance of future elections so the public will know what has been agreed between the broadcaster and the political parties.<\/p><p>  Another important question was asked by Deputy Dooley.  He asked if I had any misgivings.  I have absolutely no misgivings about appointing somebody such as Rob Morrison to this.  I approached Rob Morrison to do this report.  The next time I spoke to him was when he presented it to the board.  It is important that people know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Curran"},{"type":"speech","time":1355308200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify that.

I am declaring an interest because for most of my working life, I have earned an income from RTE, although I am not at present.  That is no reflection on RTE or on myself, it is just the nature of freelance broadcasting, as my titular head in radio, Clare Duignan, would testify.  I say that because it pains me that these people are colleagues and this is an institution for which I have enormous respect.  That respect is not is always conveyed by the general public, but they vote with their feet in that they watch and listen to RTE more than any other channel.  It is obviously doing something right and has been doing so for a long time so it pains me that when something like \"The Frontline\" programme comes up, no more than \"A Mission to Prey\", RTE finds itself under this spotlight and seems to be squirming because of failures in processes.  I compliment Noel Curran in particular in outlining all that has happened since the debate on \"The Frontline\" programme, and the report by Steve Carson and Bob Morrison suggests strongly that whatever failings there were in \"The Frontline\" programme, they will not be repeated.<\/p><p>  Mr. Curran has to a degree underestimated the impact of RTE.  That edition of \"The Frontline\" was the start of a sequence that was a game changer.  The impact on the night certainly influenced the outcome of the election.  I must also say, and again this is painful because no one has talked about the elephant in the room, that Se&aacute;n Gallagher was probably the greatest victim.  He was ahead in the polls by 15% but when we look at the content and the manner in which the questions were responded to, he caused himself enormous difficulties, no matter what was the programme format.  The public perception following the programme and the subsequent interviews saw him create a lot of difficulties for himself.  That is a purely subjective point of view.  In that context, should a debate of this importance, about electing the President, be held so close to an election where there is little time to recover ground if it is lost?  I am not sure if debates so close to an election happen in other democracies.<\/p><p>  There is currently a television series on BBC called \"The Hour\".  One of the interesting things about it is that there is nearly always someone in the gallery to oversee the line producer.

Are the witnesses happy the processes that have been put in place for training, particularly for those who are coming in and out of the station, who are not necessarily part of the public service culture, to which both I and the witnesses all subscribe and which we understand, will make people more aware of the public service obligation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200011#M00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1355309100,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Curran and the other witnesses from RTE.

I have just two brief questions.  The presenter of the show, Pat Kenny, is an eminent broadcaster, one of the best we have ever had and a man for whom I have great respect.  I would imagine the role he would play in the programme would be similar to that of a conductor of an orchestra, conducting a symphony.  Once the music starts, the conductor is in charge.  All the preparation and the people in the background are out of the equation.  A conductor will always know at some stage of the show whether the fiddle is out of tune or the brass section is coming in late.  It surprises me that Pat Kenny did not sense that something very wrong was going on and attempt to rectify it.  I want to know whether the presenter had the latitude to make up for the lacunae, which was visible to the viewing public?<\/p><p>  I disagree with Mr. Curran, but I think the tweet was a serious game-changer.  We are in politics long enough to know that one does not get swings of that magnitude overnight.  Something must cause the swing.  It was quite clear to most people that Mr. Gallagher was on course to win that election.  Bearing in mind the importance and significance of the role of the President and that his election must be above suspicion or reproach, not casting any aspersions on the winner, it would be important that nobody could have an input that would be catastrophic to one candidate and kind to another.

Will there be a clause in the contracts in the future that will allow for an event such as this to be a breach of contract and therefore such a contract would be effectively terminated by similar activities by an individual?  Please do not take my remarks as a reflection on Ms Duignan.  I do not think it is enough to say that because a person is not a member of staff, we cannot do a great deal about it.  They are still contributing, participating and have a role in terms of programming.  Can Ms Duignan do something in terms of programming?  My second question is addressed to the neutral observer.

I did not say \"The Frontline\" programme did not have an impact.  What I said was that given the range of other media commentary and appearances over the two days in question, I do not know how anyone can make the judgment that the direct quotations which were attributed to a senior editorial figure in RTE effectively decided the outcome, regardless of whether that was what he intended.<\/p><p>  To address Senator Mooney's questions, he first asked about the late timing of the debate.  The debate was originally scheduled for 17 October but the date was changed to 24 October because so many debates were taking place.  This issue crops up when one is negotiating debates.  All Government parties traditionally want debates to be held later, certainly where they involve party leaders.  The reason becomes clear when one considers what happened in the debate between Mitt Romney and President Obama that took place early in the presidential campaign.  The contender did better than the incumbent in that debate and his campaign gained momentum.  All such dates must be agreed but, as I stated, it is traditional that Government parties will seek to have debates held later in a campaign.  As a result of what occurred, we will have to examine when we hold debates, particularly complicated ones.  There were other reasons at work as there were so many debates during the election in question.  Timing is an issue we will have to consider, particularly in respect of complicated debates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200013#O00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Curran"},{"type":"speech","time":1355310300,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I should have specifically asked whether it would have been preferable to hold the debate on the Friday preceding the presidential election, which is traditionally held on a Friday.

Holding it on Monday allowed for only one full day of political discussion about the programme before the moratorium commenced the following Wednesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200013#O00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355310300,"counter":540,"content":"<p>We will have to consider that issue, including in negotiations with parties on leaders' debates.  In terms of the surprise about the confusion in the gallery, I have indicated that this was a surprise.  If there are two senior editorial figures in this key and terribly intense area when decisions are being made, it must be absolutely clear who is calling all the shots.  We have introduced an extensive system of training.  An important development to emerge from this incident is the introduction by RTE of training.  It is not done for one month or six weeks but is systematic and will continue.  It is also important that we engage with those outside the organisation.  Independent producers are a very important part of RTE production and it is important that we engage with them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Noel Harrington asked an interesting, pertinent and serious question on whether we would be here if the tweet had not been sent.  While I believe the timing would have been different in respect of where issues would have surfaced, issues surrounding the programme surfaced in other places, including the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>.  It would be difficult to say that if the tweet had not have been sent, nothing else would have surfaced.  The reason we established the new editorial standards board is in order that it will, as an external body, go into programmes, particularly where there have been elements of controversy, and engage in spot checking of editorial procedures and aspects of decision making for programmes.  From our point of view, I cannot give the Deputy an answer other than to note that we are aware of this issue and are putting in place procedures to try to tighten up the relevant regulations.<\/p><p>  In terms of audience participation, most broadcasters in most countries have audience participation, although they may do it differently.  If, during a general election where the public votes in the democratic process, one were to decide to have debates without audience participation, it would be difficult to put this proposition to the electorate.  Audience participation is a vital element of debates.  We need to learn the lessons from this case in terms of how we manage audience participation.<\/p><p>  Senator John Whelan referred to the grudging apology, which is a matter on which I have reflected.  I did not have any hesitation in apologising to Mr. Gallagher when the ruling came through.  We were involved in a process with the regulator, with legal teams working on both sides.  This probably complicates issues around either side coming forward and apologising because one is in the legal realm, rather than a head to head dispute.  RTE has set up a new complaints procedure, under which we will put up our hands and apologise quickly if we make a mistake, while defending our position if we believe we have not made a mistake.  Once such a procedure is in place, one can make a stronger defence of one's position because one has already considered whether to quickly raise one's hands and apologise.  These are ongoing debates in RTE.<\/p><p>  Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the role of the presenter.  Presenters do not run programmes.  There is a misconception outside RTE that the presenter is effectively the editor of the programme.  Presenters who are dealing with a show as complicated as &quot;The Frontline&quot; cannot also be the editors of the programme.  There is a separate editorial structure.  The presenter conducts the orchestra in the sense that he or she is centre stage, on camera and dealing with the audience.  However, presenters do not drive the editorial output of the programme.  This would be impossible as there is too much happening, with people speaking into the presenter's ear piece and set formats being transmitted through ear pieces from the editorial process.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked a direct question on the resignation issue.  I will address this issue at a general and specific level.  People talk about accountability in RTE.  The organisation is accountable to the laws of libel, as are all other media organisations.  We are also accountable to a board which has an editorial sub-committee.  It is highly unusual for a media company to have an editorial sub-committee that can question executives on editorial issues.  RTE is now subject to regulation from the regulator.  Britain is debating the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry and there is a strong argument that the recommendations go too far, with senior politicians describing them as a threat to democracy.  Leveson recommended the establishment of a statutory regulator without members from the industry and the setting of fines, all of which applies to RTE under section 53 of the Broadcasting Act.  We also have a normal complaints procedure in place and an audience council, which was established under section 96 of the Act.  The council met the board and senior management and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme.<\/p><p>  RTE has undergone wholesale changes in management.  People have left the organisation and disciplinary procedures have been used.  It has shown accountability and, as an organisation, it is accountable to many external bodies.<\/p> <p>This is another example.  This is our third time before the committee.  We have faced open interrogation, which is absolutely part of the democratic process.  That is another form of accountability.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200013#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355310900,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I asked the director general two specific questions.

The second sentence is more mysterious.  It says there were much more significant things.  When I read it I thought, \"What do they mean by that?\".  It looked as if they were saying something had been left out of the working document, as published.  That sounded like an allegation that we had intentionally left something out.  As soon as that report hit the stands there was a media frenzy suggesting exactly that.  We both got calls from a huge number of journalists asking things such as, \"What have you covered up, what have you left out, what have you watered down and what have you omitted?\".  I had to go on an RTE news programme that night and be interviewed by Tommie Gorman to say I resented the suggestion that we had intentionally left something out, presumably at the behest of RTE.  This was how the statement was being interpreted.  The following morning, I had to go on \"Morning Ireland\" at 7.15 a.m.  I am sure members of the committee are used to doing that.  I am not.

There are clearly defined roles in terms of what a director general does and what the layers of management and editorial management below that do.<\/p><p>  In terms of it being billed as the game changer and the specific questions asked by the review team, I will ask Mr. Carson and Mr. Morrison to answer Deputy McGrath's specific questions on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200015#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Curran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355311500,"counter":569,"content":"<p>The term \"game changer\" appeared in the programme \"promo\" before the 9 o'clock news.

Deputy McGrath has hit the key finding of the report which is that a direct challenging question was not put to Michael D. Higgins who was the second front runner.  We say in the report and in our analysis that it is editorially justifiable for the leading candidates to have more than one question.  That is reflected in the balance of questions submitted to the production team.  There were a lot of questions about Se&aacute;n Gallagher.  There were a lot of questions about Martin McGuinness.  There were a significant number of questions about Michael D. Higgins.<\/p><p>  The production team on air began the programme believing they would have a question on abortion, which for them would have been a direct challenging question that would have been particularly difficult for Michael D. Higgins to deal with, but it was applicable to all candidates.  That questioner did not arrive.  They then asked somebody else to ask that question, which we concluded was wrong, who agreed to do so.  As the programme began they thought they had the abortion question but half way through the programme that person changed their mind, which they were perfectly entitled to do.  They then felt, and we did not accept this, that a question on the Abbeylara amendment legislation would be asked and they felt that was their difficult question for Michael D. Higgins.  Looking at it, Mr. Morrison and I did not believe that was a particularly difficult or challenging question.  We also noted they did not put it to Michael D. Higgins first.  They gave a number of reasons and contexts and in the end we did not accept them.  We said that, come what may, there were other questioners in the audience and they could have called on them.<\/p><p>  To clarify, there were senior editorial figures closely involved in the production of this programme, but Mr. Rob Morrison and I felt there was not one figure, as Mr. Curran suggested, who was stepping back watching the programme air.  Everybody was involved in a variety of production roles and we conclude that is wrong.  In every debate that has been held since, and there have been two this year, that has not happened.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200015#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Carson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355311500,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Dooley's question.  I thank the Deputy for his comments.  As to the future and the road to recovery, I believe we have embarked on the road to recovery.  There are several key factors that are important in my experience.  One of them is that we have the right people in the right jobs.  I have been extremely impressed with many of the staff in RTE news and current affairs that I have come across so far.  We have made some new senior appointments since I started this role - the managing editor of current affairs, the new editor of \"Prime Time\" and the new editor of our investigative unit - who are all people with a great deal of journalistic experience and credibility, and I am very confident in their abilities.  The right leadership in the organisation is very important.  When I came to this job, the director general and his board had made substantial changes to training and to making the values of the organisation very clear.  A clarity about values and what we stand for is very important.  People need to understand that and have it in their DNA.  We need fairness, accuracy and impartiality.  We will be judged by our audiences and by all of the members, and rightly so, and that is very clear to our teams.<\/p><p>  There are other issues we have touched on in this discussion.  The training of the teams is very important.  There has been a substantial amount of training.  People need to know the journalism guidelines back to front and they need to be refreshed in their knowledge.  All new people who come into the organisation in whatever role need to be familiar with those, and we need to know they are familiar with them.  There is more training going on.<\/p><p>  The question of social media has come up a few times and, as I said, it is an important and current part of what we do.  It is also fraught with all manner of dangers, as we know, and trying to get a balance right between use of social media and having the guidelines in place on how we use it is very important.<\/p><p>  It is very important that we are open.  I have met representatives of many of the political parties so far and there are more to come.  I have made it clear that I come to this job with no political baggage in this country, which is an advantage in some ways.  I am working on my knowledge of politics here, and I think I am doing okay, but I have made it clear that we will listen to political parties.  If we get things wrong, we will say so and we will change them.  If I do not think we have got things wrong, I will also say so.  I think we have made that clear.  I agree with the director general that it is very important that we apologise in a timely and proper manner when we do get things wrong.  We have done that a few times and if we can do it within a programme, on the day or whatever, I would take a view about these things, but it is important we get that right.<\/p><p>  I am very honoured to have this job.  I take my personal responsibility for the job quite seriously.  When we have future general election or presidential debates it will be my personal responsibility to make sure we handle them in the correct way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012121200015#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Bakhurst"},{"type":"speech","time":1355311500,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bakhurst but on a point of clarification, he said he would listen to all political parties but I hope he will listen to the Independents also who have considerable representation in this Oireachtas.

People would be surprised to learn that presenters of high profile programmes such as this one are so bound by the editors behind the scenes and the voices in their ear pieces that they do not have the flexibility to counterbalance a problem that might arise.  I recommend to the management in RTE that people like Pat Kenny and other presenters should be told that in a situation where they believe something has gone wrong, and everybody watching the programme knew something was wrong, they should have the flexibility to ask an extra question or make a comment to balance it out.
