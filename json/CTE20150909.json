I am pleased to be here today with my colleague, Aidan Walsh.  We were the partners leading the PwC work on Project Atlas from late September 2008 until January 2009.  I was the main point of contact with IFSRA and the Department of Finance during our assignment.  We have been requested to provide evidence in two key lines of inquiry - the role of advisers in analysing the crisis and, two, the effectiveness of reviews of the bank loan books and capital adequacy.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, PwC were retained by the IFSRA on 18 September 2008.  Mr. Walsh and I met the Financial Regulator on that day.  Mr. Neary explained to us that he needed urgent assistance to look at the liquidity position and the credit quality of a number of Irish banks.  He explained that he would need us to carry out our work in a short period of time.  Following our meeting, we exchanged a proposed scope of work and an engagement letter.<\/p> <p>  We commenced our work on Anglo Irish Bank on the following day, 19 September.  Over the following number of days, our engagement was extended to include Irish Life and Permanent and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The original focus of our work was mainly on liquidity, as some of the banks were losing significant amounts of deposits and running out of money.  We attended part of a meeting at the NTMA on 28 September, where we discussed the findings of our work over the previous eight or nine days.  This work was focused mainly on liquidity and the level of provisions that existed in the banks' management accounts at the end of August 2008.  Following on that ... following on from that, we issued an e-mail summarising the information shared at that meeting.<\/p> <p>  Apart from two e-mails discussing the deposit outflows on 29 September and the deposit inflows on 30 September, we had no other meetings or contact with IFSRA, the Department of Finance or the NTMA from 28 September until 6 October.  On that date, we met the Financial Regulator in his office to discuss the work we had performed on the top 20 borrowers within each bank.  We had not been involved in any discussions around the guarantee or any alternative options being discussed at that time.  Our reports on Atlas 1 were discussed for the first time on the second week of October.<\/p><p>Following a meeting with the regulator on 8 October 2008, the Atlas 1 exercise was extended to cover all six banks and to increase the sample of the top 20 loans to the top 50 loans and the top 25 land and development loans.  This Atlas 2 was a significant exercise and involved placing a large team from PwC in each bank for approximately five weeks, with us reporting to the regulator on 17 November, approximately six weeks after the guarantee had been announced.<\/p><p> Our work involved us reviewing lots of loan files and interviewing senior management in each of the banks, with particular emphasis on lending and credit areas.  The scope of our work did not include reviews of smaller developers or any element of actual mortgage lending.  Our reports highlighted the very large exposures that the banks had to a small number of developers and the very high level of asset concentration in property.  The top ten borrowers had loans of &euro;17.7 billion with the six guaranteed banks and that was before any additional borrowings they had in Ulster Bank or Bank of Scotland Ireland.<\/p><p> The Atlas 2 reports also included, for illustrative purposes, a number of scenarios shown to impact on tier 1 capital of write-downs in various asset categories.  Following discussions on the findings of Atlas 2, the regulator requested that we undertake more work on the top 75 land and development loans.  We referred to this as Atlas 3.  We were to engage a property valuer to assist us with this work and JLL were engaged in mid-November 2008.  They were asked to focus on problem commercial real estate loans and to carry out a review of the bank's valuation of the underlying properties based on an actual medium-term view of potential future value.  JLL reported their findings on 17 December 2008.<\/p><p> We have submitted statements to the inquiry team dealing with the nature and scope of the work we were asked to carry out.  As the committee is aware, we are restricted by Central Bank legislation as to what we can say about certain confidential information that we received during our work.  Subject to these constraints, I look forward to being as forthcoming as possible in answering any questions you may have.  I will now hand you over to my colleague, Aidan Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. O'Connor.

I am pleased to be here today with my colleague, Mr. Denis O'Connor.  As he has stated, we have been requested to provide evidence to the committee on two lines of inquiry - the role of advisers in analysing the crisis and the effectiveness of reviews of bank loan books and capital adequacy.<\/p> <p>  I also attended the meeting with Mr. Neary, the Financial Regulator, on 18 September which Denis has referred to in his opening statement.  This meeting took place following the collapse of Lehman Brothers the previous weekend and the severe constraints that were being experienced on an international basis in the interbank and wholesale money markets.  As Denis has stated, following our meeting we agreed a specific scope of work and engagement letter.  We deployed separate teams to each bank.  In the first week of our work we focused, as agreed, on the movements in deposits into and out of the banks and in compiling information on the top 20 borrowers by jurisdiction in which the banks operated.  Management at the banks were co-operative and shared management and accounting information with us.  It was clear that the liquidity positions were deteriorating on a weekly and daily basis and interbank and corporate deposits were not being rolled over and where they were, the deposit periods were reducing significantly.<\/p> <p>  We both attended part of a meeting at the National Treasury Management Agency on Sunday, 28 September.  There were participants from IFSRA, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the NTMA and from Merrill Lynch, who were the financial advisers to the Government.  We did not have a draft report prepared for that meeting.  We shared information we had collected on the rapidly declining liquidity and the substantial cash deficits that were forecast by the banks to arise in the very near term.  We also shared information on a summary of the loan books at the three banks, the value of loans that were reported as impaired and the value of loan provisions that were booked.  We had not done any substantive work on credit quality at this stage, just nine days into a complex assignment.  Our next meeting, to discuss draft reports with the Financial Regulator and his staff, was on Monday, 6 October, a week after the bank guarantee had been announced.<\/p><p>As Denis has stated, we were instructed on 8 October to commence work on what was known as Atlas 2.  The results of our Atlas 2 work was reported to the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance in mid-November 2008, roughly six weeks after the bank guarantee had been announced.  The primary focus of this report was, as agreed, on the top lending positions.  It also included the results of stress tests that had been run by each of the banks on their capital adequacy ratios, and based on their own assessments of the probable emergence of future loan losses.  In addition, PwC included two additional scenarios based on higher levels of future loan losses, called scenario 1 and scenario 2.  The assumptions for these scenarios were developed in conjunction with officials from IFSRA, the Central Bank, Department of Finance and NTMA.  As is clearly stated in the report, these scenarios were for illustrative purposes only, to show the sensitivity of the banks to future losses in these two scenarios.  Our work was not intended to be a comprehensive assessment of the most likely outcome for future losses.  It is also important to note that within the timescale that we were working to, Atlas 2 did not include any third-party evaluation of property values, nor did it include a review of the security documentation supporting the loans.<\/p><p> Work on Atlas 3 then followed.  JLL's work was carried out independently of our loan reviews.  JLL were given details of the properties comprising the collateral for the loans, but the loan details were not shared with JLL.  The property values were tested based on a long-term outlook for property values, which was formulated by JLL.  The collateral values were not marked to estimated current market value at the time of the review, as there were no ... as there was no liquidity in the market and the market could not absorb a wholesale transfer of property.  The results of the JLL work were consistent with the indicative future losses calculated under scenarios 1 and 2 as part of the Atlas 2 analysis.  Mr. O'Connor and I shared responsibility for the work which PwC carried out for IFSRA in the period from 18 September 2008 to early January on the assignments that we have code-named \"Atlas\".  I too am subject to statutory obligations which prevent me from discussing confidential information which we obtained as part of our engagement on the Atlas reports.  However, I also aim to be as forthcoming as possible and of as much assistance as I can be to the committee in relation to the two themes which we have been asked to address.

So, where did the scenarios come from given that they were so far short of what happened?  And could I add to that?  When the former Taoiseach, Mr. Cowen, was giving evidence - I don't know if you saw his presentation - he said on paragraph 25, the PwC analysis was \"hopelessly optimistic\" and certainly did not envisage the crisis to develop in the way that it subsequently did.

So, our work was done before NAMA, before tier 1 capital ratios increased from 4% to 10%.  And also, there were a number of other issues like the amount of equity in the loans, which we had assumed was equity, wasn't really equity.  It was actually borrowed from a different bank or a different part of the same bank.

As you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, I served as special adviser to the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, from March 2009 to March 2011.  In this role, I advised the Minister on economic, budgetary and financial policy in responding to the economic and financial crisis.  Among other things, I played an advisory role in relation to three budgets during the period, the national recovery plan, the creation of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and other measures to address the financial crisis.  The three budgets during this period involved &euro;15 billion of fiscal adjustments at an annual rate.  These adjustments were aimed at reducing the Government's huge structural deficit, thereby restoring order to the public finances.  Reducing the structural deficit, by definition, required discretionary measures as the structural deficit would not decline due to a cyclical recovery.<br\/><br\/>In dealing with the consequences of the bursting of the bubble for the Irish banking system, the Minister's focus was on stable ... on restoring financial stability by restructuring, recapitalising and deleveraging the banking sector.  The Minister regarded the two main banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, as core retail banks that would play important roles in Ireland's economic future.  The banks required capital to remain in operation.  The banks' capital positions were being eroded by loan losses and, therefore, the banks required recapitalisation.  The Minister wanted to minimise the burden on the State of ensuring that AIB and Bank of Ireland were properly capitalised.  For that reason, he afforded the banks the opportunity to raise private capital through, for example, rights issues involving shareholders.  Ultimately, Bank of Ireland was successful in finding private sector solutions.<br\/><br\/>In the case of Anglo, the priority was to deleverage and de-risk the bank without damaging the rest of the banking system.  The Minister had an open mind as to whether a small good bank could be carved out of Anglo, as proposed by the bank's management.  Anglo had been included in the blanket bank guarantee and, therefore, the Government had to recapitalise Anglo to avoid a call by creditors on the guarantee.  Moreover, Anglo required injections of capital to retain its banking licence and thereby maintain access to Central Bank funding.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the cost to the State of recapitalising the banks, the upfront costs were large by international standards.  The Minister was confident that the State would recoup some of these outlays and wanted to spread the cost of the crisis over as long a period of time as possible.  It's worth noting that although the cost of recapitalising Anglo and INBS added markedly to measured Government debt - about &euro;35 billion - the way in which Anglo was recapitalised meant that the burden of servicing this debt is relatively low because the debt is largely held within the State sector, is long-term and can currently be financed in the market at a very low rate.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of right-sizing the banks, NAMA was established by the Government to help deleverage and de-risk the Irish banking ... the Irish banks.  Asset management companies like NAMA have been used in many countries over recent decades during financial crisis to facilitate bank restructuring and to manage and dispose of troubled assets.  Regarding the overall effectiveness of NAMA, in my testimony before this committee on 4 March last, I noted the assessment of NAMA in an independent study of the agency.  On page 2, the study states, &quot;First, the establishment of the bad asset agency, NAMA, serves as an international example of [the] successful management of bad assets.&quot;  On page 24, the study states:<\/p><blockquote>The establishment of NAMA was instrumental in the successful management of the Irish banking crisis.  It allowed the banks to recognise fully the losses on these loans, and thus removed an important source of uncertainty for the banks.  Next, the government set only overall targets for NAMA in [the] resolution of the bad assets.  The relative freedom in running down the bad loan portfolio allowed NAMA to realise a relative good price for its assets disposals.<\/blockquote> <p>Also on the same page, the study draws a key policy lesson for other countries:<\/p><blockquote>Ireland followed international best practice by setting up NAMA, [an] asset management agency to run down the bad assets of the Irish banks.  Releasing bad assets from bank balance sheets is instrumental in the path [of the] recovery.<\/blockquote> <p>I share the study's view that the establishment of NAMA played a critical role in restoring financial stability in Ireland.  I would note, however, that an asset management agency is not and cannot be expected to be a magic bullet to solve a banking crisis.  No single policy measure on its own can do that.  NAMA has been part of a set of policies that, together, have helped to restore order to the Irish banking system and contributed to the recovery in the Irish economy.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the efforts to restore international investor confidence in Ireland and its banks, during the second half of 2010 the cost to the State of borrowing on international markets rose to unsustainable levels.  Around the same time, funding in debt markets for the Irish banks dried up and the banks experienced large outflows of deposits, especially corporate deposits.  These outflows replaced by borrowings from the euro system.  The ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland provided invaluable liquidity assistance to the Irish banking system during the crisis.  I believe, however, that the ECB in 2010-2011 underestimated the systemic nature of the crisis in the euro area.  The ECB was overly anxious in the latter part of 2010 to reduce the amount of emergency loans that the euro system had extended to the Irish banking system.  There are also question marks about the ECB&rsquo;s communications with markets about individual member states.  With no access to markets at affordable rates, the Irish Government was forced to borrow from the official sector.  The EU-IMF-ECB programme of assistance provided the State with funds that were needed to finance the budget deficit and provide a functioning banking system.<br\/><br\/>Finally, Mr. Chairman, the large gains in international competitiveness recorded by the Irish economies ... Irish economy over the 2009-2010 period went a long way to creating conditions in the economy for key sectors of our economy to grow, gain market share and expand employment.  Without these gains in competitiveness, the Irish economy would not be registering the fast growth rates that we see today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  That concludes my prepared remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#X00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Ahearne"},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":696,"content":"<p>Excellent.

The management had talked about a new sort of a small business bank but I was sceptical about that.  I think the Minister was open-minded on it.  I never recall him being enthusiastic about this proposal.  The proposal to carve out a small bank came from the management.  The Minister felt that ... the argument was put to him that this carved-out small new business bank ... it might be worth something and therefore it might save the State a few billion in terms of the net costs of the banking system.  So that obviously got his attention.  He was aware that ... that we were going to need more competition in the banking system, so the idea of another bank being there was somewhat helpful.  So any interactions I had with him, he was open-minded on it, but I never remember him being convinced one way or the other.  So he wanted to give it ... this proposal a shot.

But as time went on during the summer he sort of came to the position, came around to the position that in principle this would be a good idea.  I mean, at one stage I remember, maybe in August or September, he even came up with some numbers.  He was talking about senior unguaranteed bonds after the guarantee had gone, those bondholders taking a haircut as he put it of 50%.  I mean, I remember a conversation when he begun with the line &ldquo;The bondholders are going to have to take a haircut.&rdquo;  He had numbers &ndash; 50% for the Anglo, he had smaller haircuts for AIB, 20% or something like that, and then with Bank of Ireland at one stage he mentioned maybe 5% then he said, &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s probably not worth doing it.&rdquo;  So we&rsquo;d exclude that bank.

Subordinated debt, as I understood the conversation, is explicitly subordinated.  So after all capital has been wiped out, you can then go to the subordinated debt and put losses on them.  But senior bonds are not subordinated to deposits, for example.  So, in a liquidation if you liquidated a hotel, you cannot treat the bill that is owed ... money owed to the launderette different from the money that is owed to the meat supplier.  They are senior creditors.  Unsecured senior creditors all treated equally and that was the position of the senior bonds.

The issue is how do you put a large amount of money in, let's say, &euro;30 billion.  One way to do it is to put cash in.  I mean that was done through ... AIB and Bank of Ireland were recapitalised with cash from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  There wasn't enough cash.  So, the Minister could, in theory, have asked the NTMA to go out and borrow cash, issued Government debt and whatever interest rate prevailed at the time - ten-year money might have been 5% or 6% - borrow that money and put the cash in.  A much, much cheaper way of doing it was to, rather than put cash in, to give the bank, Anglo, Government debt and that, whether it was regular Government debt or promissory note, it is all IOUs.  Because, that way, Anglo could then go to the Irish Central Bank, present that piece of paper and borrow money on the back of it.  That meant essentially that ...  so the debt was not being issued into the market.  The interest rate that was being paid on the promissory note was being paid to Anglo but Anglo was part of the Irish State as just an internal transaction.  Anglo was paying interest to the Irish Central Bank on its borrowings but the Irish Central Bank is part of the State.  All this stuff is simply internal.  The cost to the Irish State of that recapitalisation was, if you go through it and get down into the weeds, the cost was the cost of funds to the Irish Central Bank borrowing from the Eurosystem and that was extremely low - it is currently zero.  So the point was, this allowed Ireland to recapitalise this bank but the burden, the annual burden - the interest rate which is what really matters - was going to be extremely low.  And that was the advantage of the promissory note system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#Z00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Ahearne"},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":723,"content":"<p>But the State would still have to come up with the cash of &euro;3 billion every year - every March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#Z00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441753200,"counter":724,"content":"<p>So the difficulty with it was ...  I mean, people ...  when the promissory note was restructured, a lot of people said, \"The expensive, high-interest promissory note is being restructured.\"  Well, that's a misunderstanding.  The interest rate of the promissory note was irrelevant.  The interest rate was being paid to Anglo.  It's just one arm of the State to the other.  The promissory note was an extremely cheap way of financing it.  The problem with it, it was going away, it was going to be replaced every year by &euro;3 billion of money borrowed in the market.  So it wasn't that this was an expensive ... it was a really cheap arrangement but in seven or eight years' time it was gone.  So, the trick was how could you keep that cheap arrangement in place for as long as possible and that's what the promissory note deal did.  The Irish Central Bank currently owns these bonds.  The interest paid goes to the Irish Central Bank.  Look at the profits the Irish Central Bank is turning over to the Irish State.  That's all internal.  So this was a very cheap way of financing it.<\/p> <p>  &euro;30 billion is a huge number but if I told you that you were going to finance &euro;30 billion over 100 years at a zero interest rate, then it's irrelevant, it's for free.  So the point is, when you're talking about national debt like that, you have to look at ... it's not just the amount, it's the maturity and the interest cost.  And so the key to the way Anglo was being done was to get the cheapest possible finance and you can't get any cheaper than the ECB.  It created issues because the ECB then, particularly as the amount increased in the autumn of 2010, were worried that this was monetary financing, essentially that the Irish Government was borrowing at a very cheap interest rate but it was happening through the banking system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Ahearne"},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Sure.

And, therefore, a line could have been drawn over how much capital the banks needed for those particular assets.

It was clear they wouldn't raise enough private funding to get over the cliff, and therefore the Eurosystem, the ECB and the Irish Central Bank would have to help out temporarily, but if they had, in the months that then followed, they would continue to issue bonds and raise funds, and they would've been able to repay that.

Chairman and members of the inquiry, as an independent economist, I believe that major mistakes were made resulting in the economic, fiscal and banking collapse.  To help understand what happened and why, I have submitted new evidence which I hope will help the inquiry.<\/p> <p>  I am head of economic research with an independent Irish economic practice.  I joined the board of the Central Bank in 2007 as a non-executive director.  I am on the Government's labour market council and I'm a director of the IDA and chairman of London Economics.<\/p><p>My work as a professional economist has given me the opportunity, since the 1980s, to offer impartial advice to consecutive Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments and to governments internationally.  When I provide any informal advice to Irish Governments or serve on State boards, I request that I do not receive fees or expenses, a practice which is not unusual for economists.<br\/><br\/>My statement and supporting material comprises extensive notes and documentation I prepared at the time.  I ask the inquiry to excuse any references to publications that I have written.  These are not to give these publications particular significance but to confirm views I've held at key periods.  As well as the banking crisis, I have provided evidence on a number of matters of public interest, including the meeting on unemployment with An Taoiseach on the morning of 28 July 2008 - I should say with the then Taoiseach - and the continuation of the discussion over dinner at Druids Glen.  These show that I expressed concerns on the economy at the meeting and I suggested actions to prevent an even more rapid decline.  I have provided the 11 pages of detail notes I circulated at the discussion and I would be happy for the inquiry to release those notes and all of the approximate 80 pages of evidence I have submitted.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the causes of the crisis.  Before addressing the significant Irish mistakes, I would like to briefly note the design flaws in the single currency and the impact of the bankruptcy of Lehman's.  In considering why there was a crisis in Europe, the Nobel Prize winning economist, Professor Krugman, concluded:<\/p><blockquote>The truth is that the story is mostly monetary.  By introducing a single currency without the institutions needed to make that currency work, Europe effectively reinvented the defects [...] that played a major role in causing [...] the Great Depression.<\/blockquote><p>The design flaws in the single currency were particularly significant for Ireland due to our dependence on trade and the declining competitiveness.  In a publication I edited prior to Ireland joining the euro, one of my academic collaborators, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, then at Harvard University, concluded that, &quot;This is surely a big risk for a small country that is dependent on export-led growth - perhaps even too big a risk.&quot;<br\/><br\/>One concern I hold is that the required European institutions and policy instruments may not yet be in place, and complacency exists about this inadequacy.  The ideologically driven US decision on 15 September 2008 to let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt resulted in an international banking crisis of a scale not seen since the 1930s.  The combined impact of the Lehman collapse and design flaws in the single currency had horrendous implications for Europe.  The larger lending countries and international agencies tend to downplay these two factors and shift most of the blame onto peripheral countries.<br\/><br\/>Central Bank directors are understandably reluctant to criticise the international institutions, particularly given their extensive funding support for Ireland.  However, I believe the decision of these institutions to prevent Ireland from burning the bondholders and requiring Irish taxpayers to then bear the cost was morally indefensible.  This forced a small state to socialise losses and impose the burden on ordinary working people, while private sector gains were protected.<br\/><br\/>Reference to the design flaws in the euro and the Lehman's collapse is not to deny the scale of the Irish mistakes.  An unpredictable and once-in-a-century external crisis was made much worse by a gross over-dependence on the construction sector and by a failure of bankers, policy makers and regulators to adequately respond to the risks.  In my view, the key Irish mistakes were mistakes in lending decision by banks, the failure in the regulation of banks, the impact of Irish macroeconomic policy and intervention in the property sector.<\/p><p>The lending decisions made by individual banks provided loans to developers and others which turned into bad debts.  I believe this was the fundamental driver of what happened in Irish banks.  There was also a failure of bank regulation and deficiencies in stress testing and macro-prudential policy.  Detailed stress tests were undertaken but failed to anticipate the scale of the impending crisis or the level of increased capital needed.  In the aftermath of the guarantee, I felt the banks were still in denial of the necessary capital requirements.  Writing to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to provide a contrary, external perspective, I said the banks' own assessment has indicated that they may have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements after dealing with anticipated bad debts and that PwC reports suggest that, under certain scenarios, this may be the case.  My letter states that I do not accept this and concluded that action on capitalisation is needed and as soon as possible.<\/p><p> In addition to deficiencies in the interpretation of stress testing, there was insufficient regulation of banks and inadequate capital requirements, particularly in the period from 2000 to 2007.  Accurate information was not obtained on major borrowers dependent on property and I raised this at board meetings.  More intensive involvement in the approval of directors of banks would also have been appropriate.  At my very first board meeting in 2007, a new policy was outlined to dampen the growth in the property sector.  This new measure required the banks to increase to 150% the capital requirement for lending to speculative property.  It was suggested that speculative lending could then only happen after 50% of the property value had been pre-sold.  Not surprisingly, as an economist I was very supportive of this revised action as I felt it was beginning to respond to the risks.  However, I accept this proved far too little and far to late to address the scale of the crisis which emerged.<\/p><p> Regulatory weaknesses did not cause the crisis but they did not do their job and did not prevent the crisis.  This weakness was not due to the absence of supervisory powers and these cannot be used as an excuse for the misjudgments about endogenous risks and the failure to discover practices in the banks.  Once developments in individual banks became clearer and more information was available to the board, I concluded that radical changes were essential to the system of financial regulation.  I wrote to the Central Bank and Financial Regulator and to the Department of Finance, and I quote, \"It has been my opinion for some time that radical changes are needed to the system of financial regulation in Ireland\" and I went on to say that \"I believe a fundamentally changed basis for regulation of financial institutions is required\".  As you know from the letter I have submitted in evidence, I suggested major changes at the time, including: increases in the minimum requirements for capital; new controls on lending practices; changes in the incentive structures; greater levels of inspection of financial institutions; new requirements for approval processes for directors and senior management; greater levels of public disclosure and transparency; changes in the relationship between external auditors and the Central Bank; and measures to facilitate and protect internal whistleblowers.<\/p><p> Irish macroeconomic and fiscal policy also played a part in the period post-2000 and there was an over dependence on stamp duty and VAT from property and there was too rapid growth in public expenditure.  This was based on a belief that economic growth would continue, together with a consensus on the desirability for increased public expenditure.  Concerns on macroeconomic policy were a recurring theme for myself and for other economists in Ireland years prior to the crisis.  In a publication to honour Dr. T.K. Whitaker's 80 years, I indicated - and I'll quote - \"while the lessons of previous policy errors are well known, there are potential dangers ... particularly if public expenditure programmes are planned on an assumption of continued rapid growth.\"<\/p><p>I emphasised the difficulty of adjusting public expenditure programmes which could result in the emergence of a large deficit and an expansion of public debt if there was an economic downturn.  <br\/><br\/>Interventions in the property sector also fuelled the fire of property prices.  In 1997, I argued that policy should, by appropriate planning and zoning decisions, ease the shortage of land for residential housing.  Restrictive zoning meant windfall gains to property speculators, increased housing costs and opened up opportunities for corruption.  The escalation in property prices was further fuelled by the build-up of tax incentives.  My views on this were informed by an investigation of property tax incentives which I and other economists completed for the Department of Finance in 2005.  My views at that time indicated that while the incentives were supported by a range of vested interests, including investors, property developers and banks dependent on property, my report concluded:<\/p><blockquote>There is absolutely no case for further government incentives.  Continuing to approve new projects would contribute to oversupply and represent a clear waste of scarce public resources.<\/blockquote><p>I strongly recommended the abolition of the vast range of property incentives.  <br\/><br\/>On crisis management, in the period since I joined the board of the Central Bank in 2007, there were detailed plans by the Central Bank to deal with the liquidity position and a domestic standing group was established jointly with the Department of Finance to examine risks and responses.  The focus was on liquidity risks and this intensified over time.  On 16 September 2008, a note to directors of the Financial Regulator pointed out that term funding was effectively closed.  It stated that post-Lehman's, public concern was increasing and the tone of media comment was systemic rather than institution-specific.  Investors were cutting lines to Irish banks and requesting breaks in the terms of deposits.  In addition to two institutions which were being very closely monitored, one of the other major institutions advised that, &quot;If markets do not improve, they risk breaking liquidity ratios in a matter of weeks.&quot;  This signalled to me the danger of a full scale run on the Irish banking sector.  <br\/><br\/>While liquidity risks were monitored, there was much less understanding of solvency and this was a major mistake.  This may have been due to the belief that solvency and liquidity were separate.  The week of the bank guarantee, leading to the guarantee decision, resulted in Irish citizens paying a very high and unjust cost for the banking crisis.  The guarantee was not thought up on the night of 29 September but arose from extensive analysis by the Department of Finance, Central Bank and regulator, with the teams of external advisers.  I first heard of the guarantee as the main option being considered in an emergency joint Central Bank-IFSRA board meeting which was called on 25 September but this option must have been developed earlier.  As is evident from the official board minutes which I have supplied you with, the Governor and the Central Bank and the Department of Finance indicated that a guarantee of the liabilities of the six financial institutions was being considered.  There was no suggestion at that time of any option to guarantee some banks but to nationalise others.  The Central Bank board was never asked for a view on that revised option.  The minutes of the Central Bank board meeting on 25 September show: &quot;The Governor and the Chairman of the Authority briefed the meeting on the ongoing discussions with the banks and the Department of Finance regarding the liquidity position of the Irish banks and policy options to be considered if the position continued to deteriorate&quot;.  It indicated that the Minister for Finance ... the then Minister for Finance had convened a meeting on Wednesday, 24 September, attended by the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the NTMA and the Department of Finance and, I assume, by their advisers.<\/p><p>The Government had also met with the Minister ... the Governor of the Central Bank had also met with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  The outcome of this meetings ... of these meetings was that the Government wanted policy options for the future of the financial sector to be developed and refined, as a matter of urgency, over the weekend for consideration by the Cabinet at the start of the following week.  Following a detailed discussion on the liquidity pressure on all the banks in what was referred to as ... unprecedented international credit crunch, it was suggested that if the liquidity situation did not improve, the issue for the authorities would be how to address the whole financial system.<br\/><br\/>The minutes highlight what was seen as the key policy option.  The minutes explicitly noted that a key policy option for the weekend was whether or not the Government should issue a formal guarantee for the liabilities of the six domestically-owned credit institutions.  If a decision was to be made in this regard, the Government would require the formal advice of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator on the necessity of such a measure and its impact.  On hearing this proposal, I raised the following questions at the board.  Would it be illegal under state aid rules?  I suggested I expected it would be challenged.  How could one minimise any exposure to the State?  Would financial markets and the public view this as a credible guarantee?  Had all alternative options been fully exhausted?  And was there any hope of ECB-wide action before consideration was given to such a radical decision?  I knew the Government ... the Governor of the bank had been very actively exploring ECB action for some time.  And how would any guarantee interact with the necessary restructuring action on individual institutions in order to ensure viability?  I clearly remember the representative from the Department of Finance and the Governor and some other directors also expressed strong views on that latter issue.<br\/><br\/>I made suggestions to attempt to protect the taxpayer and reduce the risk to the State if such a policy was subsequently decided - firstly, by ensuring any guarantee was for as short a time period as necessary and I argued against any long-term guarantee.  I indicated if the State felt obliged to give a guarantee, we should get out of these obligations as quickly as possible.  I suggested that in the event of any guarantee, the banks should be forced to pay in full for this and the payment levels should reflect the value to the banks and the risk to the State.  Some of these points which I and the other directors made were reflected in the formal, signed-off, agreed minutes of the meeting, and I quote:<\/p><blockquote>In discussing the option of a Government Guarantee, the meeting noted that the market would have to be convinced of the credibility of the Guarantee.  There was also a likelihood of a legal challenge on competition grounds if it was confined to the domestic credit institutions.  The meeting agreed that the issue of an explicit Government Guarantee supported by a willingness to supply additional funding, if necessary, warranted detailed consideration.  In this context, however, it would be necessary to identify a viable long-term strategy for the industry and [to] pursue this objective vigorously.<\/blockquote><p>I had the distinct impression at the meeting that a guarantee of all banks was the favoured option and probably the only option in serious consideration which was explained to the board.  I felt strongly at that stage that all available options should be examined, rather than simply the guarantee option, and I decided that evening to write to the Department of Finance, the regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank.  As is evident from my correspondence of 25 September 2008, which I have provided to the committee, I outlined my view on the principles which should be followed: (i) State exposure to be minimised where possible; (ii) the knock-on impact of any decision should be taken into account and the minimisation of contagion; the cost of any assistance to be paid for fully by the sector, even if this means over time; and wider economic implications should be factored in.  The best option was, in my view, a European-wide, EC-wide ... ECB-wide action.  My opinion was there was a reluctance by the ECB to recognise the scale of the problem or to take necessary responsibility for their role, but I felt pursuing that action was desirable.<br\/><br\/>On the option of a guarantee of all six financial institutions, as proposed by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, I was ... felt there was a need to consider different formulations if this was the chosen option.  I also raised explicitly my concern over whether it would postpone necessary restructuring of Irish banks.  I had concerns over whether a guarantee would be effective in preventing a bank run and what would be the market reaction.  This was still a major concern to me in the days and weeks after the guarantee was announced.  I also suggested the payment terms could be structured in a way which would neutralise the competitive impacts, i.e. some banks should pay proportionally more.  My suggestion implied much higher costs for institutions such as Irish Nationwide and Anglo.  I highlighted the need to take action to reduce Exchequer exposure and to restructure the sector.  In my written advice on 25 September 2008 to the Governor of the Central Bank and to the Department of Finance, I outlined three other issues which I felt needed to be addressed as well as the immediate issue of liquidity, namely, a response to individual banks with liquidity issues, actions to reduce risk and potential exposure and plans to restructure the sector.  The options for action in relation to individual banks which I proposed on 25 September 2008 included management changes, restrictions on loan ... on loans and a restructuring plan, including managing-down of loans.<br\/><br\/>Over the next few days, it was very clear the crisis was getting much worse and I felt a bank run was now a real possibility.  There was a sense of incredible panic in world financial markets and policy makers were in uncharted waters.  I had come to the view that Ireland could face the total collapse of the banking system and the ECB was taking the attitude that we were on our own.  By the time we had reached 29 September, I knew from the previous board meeting of the Thursday - of the 25th - that the Government ... that the Governor had indicated he'd previously been against the guarantee but then ... by then felt things had changed.  The decision of the US Congress to reject the bailout plan ... their bailout plan - which was an extraordinary decision - meant there was now ... while there was up to then a chance that liquidity pressures would ease, things had now fundamentally changed.  My view is that given this development, the guarantee was the sensible option, but of the terrible options available.  However, I always understood that a response to the liquidity crisis would at best only buy time to address the underlying problems and to deal with the issues in individual banks.  As soon as the guarantee was introduced, my focus was on how to minimise the exposure to the taxpayer and I wrote, on 20 October 2008, to the Governor of the Central Bank and to the Department of Finance stressing that &quot;the day we give a time limited guarantee is the day we need to plan for exiting&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I would like to very briefly suggest a number of issues for possible consideration by the committee that may help to avoid another crisis, namely: supply issues in the housing market, unless addressed, could result in the re-emergence of rapidly increasing property prices and rental prices and even greater levels of homelessness; Governments might usefully consider using any unexpected windfall gains in Exchequer return to repay national debt, rather than fund tax reductions or increased expenditures; the Central Bank should base its policy in regulation on an assumption that any regulated institution could fail and, if it is of systematic importance, will be bailed out, and regulation should reflect that; there is ... a renewal in bank governance and personnel should be a requirement; changes in the nature of auditing of banks are required; and banks need to incentivise long-term gains, rather than spurious short-termism.

I think it was in the early to mid-1990s, in a book that I wrote that, Senator, you may be aware of because one of your colleagues, Professor McAleese, was one of the contributors.  But in my chapter on that book I pointed out, back then, back in I'm not sure if it was 1992 or 1995, that no new taxation measures should be introduced for any activity in the non-traded sectors of the economy.  And I pointed out that views ... viewed in isolation many of the tax incentives for certain property and other investment might appear defendable in order to achieve a specific local or other objective, but viewed against the background of the need to encourage tradeable activities, such activities cannot in general be justified.  And I purposely went on to say that there should be no further extension to the timescale for them, and I pointed out that whenever a date is set for the cessation of investment-related property tax incentives, strong vested interest groups will emerge to seek an extension of such deadlines.  The case will be argued that investments were in the planning stage and it would be inequitable to have the cut-off date.

They were about trying to deal with what I felt was the escalating unemployment position and the issue of social housing I don't think had any relevance to the banking sector.  It was something that I felt very strongly about and normally in a context like this, one would not disclose information like this, but I came from a family that was homeless at one stage and I ended up in local authority tower blocks in Ballymun and I know the importance of people not having a house and this was a policy issue which I felt would have a social benefit and which would help create employment.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  I have been a career banker, starting with AIB in 1979 where I worked in various branch banking and head office departments.  In 1990, I joined Anglo Irish Bank as lending manager in its Dublin branch.  I was promoted to divisional head in 1997.  In November 2000, I resigned from the bank to join the Devey Group as chief executive.  The Devey Group was a Dublin-based health care, hospitality and property group with business operations in Ireland and Portugal.  After approximately 11 months with the Devey Group, I was approached by the Anglo CEO, Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick to rejoin the bank.  I returned to the bank in February 2002 to establish a new division in the bank called the wealth management division.  The wealth management division was an amalgam of various private banking operations in Dublin, London, Vienna, Geneva and the Isle of Man.  In January 2004, I was appointed as an executive director to the board of the bank.  In January 2005, I was appointed head of lending Ireland as part of significant management changes introduced by the newly appointed CEO, David Drumm.  In April 2007, I advised Mr. Drumm and the chairman, Mr. FitzPatrick, of my intention to leave the bank with the announcement of my departure being made to the Stock Exchange on 4 September 2007 and set up a new business LeBruin, which is a corporate finance and debt advisory business now employing 20 people in Dublin, Galway and London.  I welcome the opportunity to be of assistance to the inquiry.<\/p> <p>  Given that I left the bank at this time, I can only be of limited assistance on what happened in the last quarter of 2007 and through 2008 when the bank experienced growing pressures and issues, which culminated in the Government guarantee and, ultimately, the nationalisation and State bailout of the bank.<\/p><p>The inquiry has provided me with core documents.  I have, however, not had any insight into the workings of the bank itself since I left in 2007.  I will, again, however, do my best to be of assistance to you.<\/p><p> When I left the bank in 2007, I firmly believed that the credit approval process, the loan review process, the ongoing reviews of credit policies and the developing risk function within the bank were sufficiently robust to provide early indications of problems in the loan book to the executive team, the board and to the Financial Regulator.  Over the ten years to 2005, Anglo Irish Bank had transformed from being a small player in the Irish marketplace to becoming a serious player in terms of market share in chosen segments in Ireland, with a growing business in the UK and an emerging business in the US.  This performance in Ireland was driven by a number of factors: a very active, long-standing client base, many of whom had become the leading players in the property development and investment sectors; very strong customer loyalty across the core client base, which ensured a high level of repeat business for the bank; and an economic environment with low interest rates and wholesale bank funding at unprecedented levels.  The success of Anglo over the ten-year period to 2005 was reflected not just in the growth of the loan book, but also in year-on-year increases in earnings and a strong market rating recognised by reputable international agencies such as Oliver Wyman who, in 2007, named the bank as the best performing bank in the world over the previous five years.<\/p><p> Due to this comparative success and to the prevailing economic conditions, competition in the mid-2000's began to significantly intensify.  This competition came from existing universal banks in Ireland and from emerging foreign lenders in the market.  For example, AIB bank established what they called win-back teams to target former clients who'd moved their business elsewhere, or existing clients who were multi-banked.  Emerging players, such as Bank of Scotland Ireland, ACC Bank and Ulster Bank, all competed very aggressively to wrest market share from existing banks, including Anglo.  All of this led to an avalanche of credit in the marketplace.  The timing of the Savills launch could not have been worse.  Asset values rocketed, signs were emerging of a property bubble and, while the general consensus was that the market would have a soft landing, the emerging evidence indicated a serious potential problem.<\/p><p> In early 2006, the Anglo board decided, on the basis of management advice, to change its lending policy reflecting the concerns we held about the acceleration in asset values and given the growing intensity of competition.  A decision was taken that no new clients with development funding proposals would be entertained.  The bank would exclusively deal with existing customers with a deal carrying an acceptable level of risk.  This policy change became widely known in the marketplace and, indeed, some competitors played on this in their tactics to attract new development business.  This policy change was Anglo's attempt to curtail activity in this sector of the market, which, clearly, had begun to overheat.  On reflection, the motivation for this policy change was entirely correct; however, the policy itself was seriously flawed because it did not go far enough.  We continued to support our bigger existing clients who continued to be active in the market, which led to very large exposures to a concentrated number of clients.  The lending proposals at that time all met the acceptable levels of risk.  These proposals were from long-term, proven operators, each with a depth of expertise and capability to deliver successful projects time and again.<\/p><p> Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, the failure to more forcibly implement the policy decision taken in early 2006 together with the shortcomings in the policy itself was a serious mistake.  The consequences of this mistake became very clear when the property market in Ireland collapsed, resulting in very significant losses for the bank.  The bank should not have defended its position with its biggest borrowers against the intensive competition in the market to the extent that it did.  This defence led to unacceptable exposures concentrated on a relatively small number of customers, and no matter how professional and capable these customers were, the concentrated risk profile which resulted from this defence was to put the bank's loan book at an unacceptable risk.<\/p><p> Regarding the funding of the bank during this period, I did not experience that funding was under pressure prior to my departure from the bank.  Through the early part of 2007, wholesale corporate and retail funding had held up well and the performance of the bank in attracting new funding was very good.  There was no indication of stress.  However, the pressure which emerged ultimately, post the Northern Rock issue, demonstrated that the funding base was not sufficiently wide, deep or stable to underpin the scale of the loan book.  It also since emerged that at the time of my departure from the bank, Se&aacute;n Quinn had a sizeable position in the bank through CFDs, contracts for difference.  I was not made aware of this, although other board directors of the bank were.  Although Se&aacute;n Quinn's CFD position would go on to cause difficulties for the bank, it would not, however, be appropriate for me to make any further comment on this matter because of ongoing legal proceedings.<\/p><p> When I left Anglo, I genuinely believed that the bank was solvent and liquid.  Indeed, a thought that a liquidity or solvency issue would emerge was alien to me.  I did not see a threat to the long-term viability of the bank as I left the bank in 2007.  I was a senior executive and an executive director of Anglo until 2007.  Given what ultimately happened and the consequent impact on so many people, staff, customers, shareholders and the State, I deeply regret my own role in the building of the loan book to what became an unsustainable, overly concentrated scale.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#QQQ00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":1813,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Browne, for your opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#RRR00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":1814,"content":"<p>Could we have clarification as to when Mr. Browne, exactly, left the bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#RRR00300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1441753200,"counter":1815,"content":"<p>My announcement was on 4 September 2007 to the Stock Exchange, and I physically departed out of the bank, probably, over the following four to five weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#RRR00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":1816,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015090900002#RRR00500","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1441753200,"counter":1817,"content":"<p>Thank you.

That's how much loans that could not be perfected because of ... or could not ... had to be written off as a result of unperfected security, and the majority of them rested with your bank.  We see on the core documents, Vol. 2, page 63 ... we see an example of 12 files that was carried out.  And of ten of those files, no letter from the bank's solicitors confirming the security was complete is evident, that's, 83%.  These are loans above &euro;6 million.  It talks about the credit policy where draw-down shouldn't happen unless it's authorised in writing by a manager before the perfection of security, but we see that the draw-downs were taking place.  And I think in the situation the number of draw-downs up to the time of the review for the 12 selected loans was 67.  So, again, we are seeing, like, loans of &euro;149 million which were drawn down with no solicitor's letter on file.  So, as a result of your credit policy, that would have had to be authorised by a manager.
