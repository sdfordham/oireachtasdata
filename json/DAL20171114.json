Its establishment followed a long saga of harassment, poor treatment and attacks on the bona fides of Sergeant McCabe.  When it emerged, following the conclusion of the commission of investigation, that the legal representative of the former Garda Commissioner was instructed to attack the motivation and integrity of Sergeant McCabe, people felt genuine shock and anger.  That was not how it was meant to be.  The O'Higgins inquiry was meant to be a new chapter in the way in which the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe were to be treated as well as in the way he was treated as a person.  It was supposed to find out the facts of what happened and it was never meant to be an adversarial attack on his credibility and integrity as a person.  We have now learned in various reports over the last number of days that the head of Garda HR was told \"We are going to go after Maurice at the commission\".  It is also reported that a telephone call was made on 15 May from the former Commissioner to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality on the proposed legal strategy.<\/p>  <p>  To be fair, Deputy Alan Kelly has tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this issue of the extent of consultation between the Department and the former Garda Commissioner, the extent and content of meetings and communications, if any, between the Department's officials and the former Commissioner and whether complaints were made to the Department about the legal strategy adopted and how it was adopted.  In the normal course, questions like these should receive straightforward answers.  The answer from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is classic in the sense that he answered a question which he was not asked and failed to answer the questions he was asked by Deputy Kelly.  Deputy Kelly has followed up with further questions which are very serious in nature and to which the answers will be serious too.  In the context of a Parliament like this, it is very strange that replies are not being given.  In an interview at the weekend, the T&aacute;naiste refused to confirm or deny whether she was aware of this adversarial approach being taken at the O'Higgins commission.  The Taoiseach said at the weekend that he would speak to the two Ministers.  Has he spoken to the two Ministers, what has been their response, and can the Taoiseach bring clarity to this issue?  Did the T&aacute;naiste know about the attack on the integrity and credibility of Sergeant McCabe as per the legal strategy of the former Garda Commissioner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400004#B00100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1510668300,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The first thing that should be recognised is that we as a Government are committed absolutely to establishing the facts around these matters and this very sorry affair.

She is currently in the United Arab Emirates on a trade mission.  She confirmed to me that she had no hand, act or part in forming the former Commissioner's legal strategy, nor did she have any prior knowledge of the legal strategy the former Commissioner's team pursued.  She found out about it after the fact, but around the time it was in the public domain when everyone else knew about it as well.  The current Minister for Justice and Equality was not a Minister in the Department at the time and he also had no hand, act or part in, or prior knowledge of, the legal strategy being pursued by the former Commissioner's legal team.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality is a big place with many different people in it but, as things stand, the Department has not been able to find any record of being informed before the fact of the legal strategy the Commissioner was going to pursue.  It was told about the approach taken by the Commissioner's senior counsel but that was after the cross-examination had taken place.  The Department was not in a position, after the fact, to express concerns about it or counsel against it.  The Deputy claims there was a call to the Secretary General on the day of the cross-examination but we have not been able to confirm if that is or is not the case.  I think that perhaps it is not and that the assertion may be false but I do not want to swear to it today or until I can find out for certain.  There may well have been a telephone call from the Commissioner's office to the Department on the day but it is not unusual for the Commissioner's office to contact the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p> The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, had no hand, act or part in the legal strategy and had no prior knowledge of it.

The overriding message in the reports from <i>Daft.ie<\/i>and the ESRI is that accommodation has become unaffordable and supply is at an all-time low.  As things stand, renting or buying a home is now beyond the reach of an entire generation.  Rather than delivering opportunity, the Government's housing crisis has instead delivered extreme stress, depression and hopelessness for thousands of citizens, who work hard and who aspire to a better life but for whom there is very little reward.<\/p><p>Ten years ago, a couple would make sacrifices in their daily lives to save for a deposit for a home but today they make exactly the same sacrifices simply to meet the extortionate rent that is due at the end of each month, if they are lucky.  Life goals that were once considered modest and common have all been made impossible and people have told me their relationships are cracking under the strain of the housing emergency.<\/p><p>For many people in their late 20s to mid 30s even the idea of starting a family now falls into the bracket of unaffordability.  These are the very real human consequences for those struggling to get on the property ladder or struggling to pay their rent.  This is the reality and we hear it every day.  The damage that is being done to people, including to their mental and physical health, is devastating.  They spend 40 hours a week at work, and some spend more, but they have precious little to show for it.  They cannot build a future and they find themselves in an exhausting economic and psychological dead end.  So much for a republic of opportunity.  It is nothing but a dupe.<\/p> <p> I suggest the Taoiseach needs to change track.  Instead of trying to normalise homelessness in this State with crude statistical exercises he needs to implement policies that actually work.  The Government must increase the supply of affordable housing and introduce measures to reduce the cost of purchasing or renting a home.  Just so as the Taoiseach knows, affordable housing means properties at a sale price of between &euro;160,000 to &euro;260,000 in Dublin.  This would meet the needs of households earning above the threshold for social housing but below the &euro;75,000 a year mark.  It would mean affordable rental tenancies with fair rent.  We have repeatedly suggested some solutions that meet these problems.  Will the Taoiseach today commit to introducing a new affordable housing scheme that delivers homes on a level that matches the scale of the crisis we face?  Rather than throwing renters to the wolf of market forces, will the Taoiseach introduce legislation that delivers real rent certainty by linking increases to the cost of living?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400005#C00400","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510668900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very welcome back.  I understand she was on a fundraising trip to the United States last week.  I hope that went very well.<\/p><p>In terms of the two reports the Deputy mentioned, the <i>daft.ie<\/i>report and the ERSI report both add to our understanding of this issue and they are both worth a read and worthy of consideration.  I had the opportunity on the way in this morning to listen to some experts on housing speak about the two reports on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;.  They came from very different perspectives, from <i>daft.ie<\/i>, the ESRI and the Nevin Institute.  They all agreed the fundamental underlying problem is a lack of supply and the fact we do not have enough houses, apartments and homes for a country with a rising population, increasing employment and changing demographics with more people in smaller households.<\/p><p>In terms of supply, we are increasing the provision of social housing.  Between 2,000 and 3,000 social houses will be completed before the end of the year.  This is a significant increase on last year and the year before.  This will increase to approximately 4,000 to 5,000 next year.  In terms of affordability, we have provided hundreds of millions for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, to make sites accessible and make it possible for developers to build on them.  There is a requirement as part of this that a significant number of the units be affordable.  We also announced in the budget the establishment of house building finance Ireland.  This will make it much cheaper for builders to get finance.  This will take some time to get up and running but will be up and running sometime next year.  We have also increased the vacant site levy to punish people who hoard land.  At Cabinet today, we decided to make an amendment to the Finance Bill to require the Department of Finance to produce a report on a vacant house tax and how this might work.  This will be for the consideration of the D&aacute;il.  We have also fast tracked planning and we are changing the building regulations.  We are seeing results.  Planning permissions are up 49% year on year, commencement notices are up 45% year on year and next year we anticipate somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 new homes being built, which is not enough but is a significant improvement on previous years.<\/p><p>The report on rent refers to rents advertised, so it does not cover the rent pressure zones.<\/p><p>As a result of the introduction of the rent pressure zones, 60% of renters now have rent certainty and rent control and cannot have their rent increased by more than 4% in any one year.  That has given huge relief and security to people who are renting.

We would have found it more comforting if he had told us that the reports have illuminated his understanding.  Perhaps he just does not want to know.

By contrast, a mere &euro;25 million be allocated over the next two years to build houses that are really affordable, such as those on sale in the Poppintree area of Ballymun.  People like clerical staff and factory workers who are on average incomes can afford to buy such houses.  The Taoiseach has performed an about-face.  I have quite deliberately set out for him the human consequences of the catastrophe people are facing.  I hear these stories and I am sure he hears them too.

The real issue for the Taoiseach is not that the crisis will have a knock-on effect on the Department but rather why that information is being released now through the offices of his former Cabinet colleague, whose party supported N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan 100% - not just in government but in opposition -  when revelations in respect of her legal strategy regarding Maurice McCabe had been made.  Critically, what is the Taoiseach going to do about this?  He has fared pretty well out of Garda controversies but he is now the boss and this is solely a matter for him.  He can either choose to be a pawn in the games being played by the warring tribes that exist within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - with the Department of Justice and Equality mandarins in the background - or he can decide to take decisive action in the context of delivering a modern police service that the citizens and garda&iacute; deserve.<\/p> <p> Last week, senior Garda officers who attended a pre-retirement course were shocked to see none other than the acting Garda Commissioner amble in and sit down to listen to what was being said.

As a result, GSOC cannot publish its report because it was previously been prevented from attending the disciplinary action involving these garda&iacute; and has been frustrated in trying to access files.  How can there be change without accountability or effective oversight and how long is the Taoiseach going to allow this situation to prevail?  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is flopping around on the outskirts coming up with nice jargon about new uniforms and new words.  How in God's name will the chaos be stopped when there is nobody at the helm?  What other company with 15,000 members of staff would not have a CEO in place?  What job takes that long to fill?

Discussions are under way with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the Policing Authority to make that happen because it is important that we have a new Garda Commissioner in place sooner rather than later and that this individual will be able to bring in his or her own team.  I do not think one person alone can change An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This is a very practical example of reform that is under way.  For the first time, somebody from an outside police force - in this case, an officer from the PSNI - can be appointed to a senior position in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so that is an outside appointment to a senior position.

Under that Act, &euro;1.24 billion was placed with the SBCI to finance enterprises that provide credit to small and medium-sized enterprises.  The SBCI raised &euro;1.24 billion, of which &euro;525 million came from the State.  By December 2015, &euro;751 million in total had been approved to lenders by the SBCI, of which &euro;675 million was allocated to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  Only &euro;235 million was drawn down and of that, only &euro;172 million went into the market.  Amazingly, the banks managed to retain &euro;63 million, which improved the liquidity of their balance sheets.  By the end of 2016, the banks had increased their retention of this fund to &euro;112 million, which again improved the look of their balance sheets.  By the end of 2016, 84% of money given out by the SBCI for so-called investment purposes went towards car leasing, hire purchase and property restructuring.  This is asset-backed lending as opposed to what it was meant for, which is working capital lending.  The purpose of this type of lending was never envisaged by the Act.  According to the 2016 published accounts, which cover two years and four months of SBCI operations, 11% went to working capital and &euro;27 million, or 5%, went to clear off the debt in Ireland of three foreign banks, namely, ACC, Danske Bank and Lloyds Bank of Scotland.<\/p><p>Also included in that &euro;27 million was a figure for a further bailout of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The main criteria for access to the fund were inconsistent and prohibitive.  They set the bar so high that only the banks would be eligible.  On closer scrutiny it is now obvious from responses to freedom of information requests that neither the banks nor the five other successful lenders met the qualification criteria as set down by SBCI.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, the three main banks did not set up a special purpose vehicle, SPV, or produce projections as per the criteria.  This resulted in no transparency as to where the money was going and the purpose for which it was used internally in banks.  Apart from the three established banks funded by the SBCI, five other private non-banking companies were successful in securing SBCI funds.  Of these five, four are only involved in leasing and property finance, and not working capital.  Coincidentally two of the new non-banking lenders which received SBCI funding of &euro;91 million are headed up by former senior executives of failed banks.  One of these new companies was also handed an equity injection of a further &euro;30 million by the NTMA, which is the parent company of SBCI.<\/p> <p> From work by various accountants it is now apparent that the majority of companies in receipt of this fund are using the funds to improve the liquidity of their balance sheets as opposed to lending to SMEs.  We need to establish if SBCI is operating in contravention to the Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400009#G00400","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510671000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It provides that any person who engages in a sexual act with a child who is under the age of 17 shall be guilty of an offence.  The section also sets out the penalties for anybody found guilty of such an offence.  I will outline the penalties.  A term of seven years of imprisonment is provided for a person who is found guilty of the offence.  If, however, the person is in a position of authority, the term of imprisonment that shall be imposed shall be a term not exceeding 15 years.<\/p><p>The purpose of the legislation I seek to introduce is to increase those penalties, which we believe are too low.  Currently, the maximum sentence is a term of seven years if one is not in a position of authority.  Under the legislation I seek to introduce today, we would change that maximum sentence up to a term of 15 years.  Similarly, if a person in a position of authority is found guilty of defilement of a child under the age of 17, we believe the maximum term of imprisonment should be changed from 15 years to a potential penalty of life imprisonment.<\/p><p>Obviously we cannot dictate the sentence that a court will impose on any particular situation but we can set out what the maximum sentence should be.  It is important that the Oireachtas should set out its revulsion of these offences by increasing the sentences that may be available to the courts.<\/p><p>It is noteworthy that the legislation I have just referred to, and especially the sentences, are quite low when one considers the other sentences available for persons convicted of offences relating to children.  For instance, anybody who meets a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation can, at present, face a maximum sentence of up to 14 years.  Engaging in sexual activity in front of a child for sexual gratification can be subject to a sentence of up to ten years.  In those circumstances we believe the penalty that currently exists is simply not strong enough.<\/p><p>We seek to introduce this legislation to enable the Oireachtas to set out its abhorrence to these particular offences.  I believe it is important to note that on many occasions, the Oireachtas criticises judges for sentences they impose.  Members need to recognise that we have a responsibility when it comes to making law in respect of those sentences.  If we believe sentences are not strong enough then we should do what we can do in this House by increasing the maximum sentence for a particular offence.  By increasing the maximum sentence we are setting the tariff and are giving an indication to the courts that this is how society views these offences.<\/p><p>I shall conclude.  I believe that we in this House are too tolerant of certain types of criminal activity.  The public is genuinely revolted by certain crimes against children and I do not believe that we reflect that adequately in our laws.  Members need to become much more intolerant of crimes committed throughout the community such as repeat burglary and gratuitous violence against individuals and I hope that in the near future Fianna F&aacute;il will bring forward legislation to show that.  The time for being tolerant of criminal activity that is gratuitous, serious and which has a big impact on individuals should come to an end.  I seek leave to introduce this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400017#P01500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1510673700,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400017#P01600","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1510673700,"counter":115,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400017#P01700","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510673700,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510673700,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400017#P01900","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1510673700,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400017#P02000","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510673700,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1510673700,"counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400017#P02200"},{"type":"speech","time":1510673700,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a person's mental health status and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>The Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2017 seeks to amendment the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 to expand the definition of mental health.  In 1998 and 2000, respectively, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act.  Disability is one of the nine grounds of discrimination set out in the Acts.  While the definition of disability includes mental illness, the definition within the Acts provides a restrictive medical definition of mental health.  Attitudes, stereotypes and prejudices about mental health can lead to discrimination.<\/p><p>In my role as mental health spokesperson, I regularly meet people who tell me they have been discriminated against because of their mental health status.<\/p><p>These are people who find themselves treated less favourably than someone else solely because of their mental health status.  For that reason, my party and I bring forward this Bill with a broadened definition of mental health to prevent discrimination on mental health grounds, on a human rights basis.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks to add an expanded definition of mental health under the equality legislation.  This Bill aims to solve three problems.  First, it will help employees who may have a mental health issues.  It does so by tackling one of the obstacles facing people who suffer from a mental health issue in their employment situation, namely, discrimination.  If enacted, it will be crystal clear for employers and employees alike that discrimination based on mental health status is against the law.<\/p><p>The second problem it will address is the need to prohibit any attempt to limit services based on a person&rsquo;s mental health status.  This legislation will make it illegal to limit the provision of services based on a person&rsquo;s mental health status.  Discrimination on the grounds of mental health status violates the very principle of equality for which we all seek to strive.<\/p><p>Finally, this Bill promotes equality by seeking to protect those who have been subjected to discrimination.  It is crucial that every person is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of a person&rsquo;s mental health status.  This Bill will serve as a further step towards bringing Ireland in line with international standards on equality and understanding of mental health as a human rights issue and not just a medical illness issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400017#P02300","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":123,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510674300,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00500","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510674300,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Institutions Statutory Fund (Amendment) Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee [Private Members]","time":1510674300,"counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Education and Skills pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 141.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510674300,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2017: Referral to Joint Committee","time":1510674300,"counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00850"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the following Regulations in draft:Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2017,copies of which were laid in draft form before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 13th November, 2017, be referred to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(4)(<i>k<\/i>), which, not later than 28th November, 2017, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q00900","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510674300,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Amendment of Standing Orders: Motion","time":1510674300,"counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That, in accordance with the recommendations under Standing Order 107(1)(<i>a<\/i>) of the sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform, and with effect from Tuesday 21st November, 2017, the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann relative to Public Business be amended as follows:<br \/><br \/>(<i>a<\/i>) in Standing Order 23, in paragraph (1), by the substitution of &lsquo;10.30 a.m.&rsquo;

The key priorities facing the Taoiseach are numerous, as he acknowledges, but the key concerns for citizens are the housing crisis, the crisis in health and Brexit.  All of these issues require a robust response from Government.  One must ask, however, why a Government would act robustly when it fails to deal with basic facts and, indeed, peddles falsehoods.  At the weekend, the Taoiseach made light of a serious problem affecting our society when he stated that Ireland had one of the lowest homelessness rates by international standards when compared with our peers.  He was not, of course, comparing like with like in making this inaccurate claim.  Other states across the OECD have broader definitions of homelessness.  In addition, the OECD data for Ireland the Taoiseach's spin team used were out of date by two years.  It is clear at page 1 of the report that different countries count homelessness in different ways.  The figures published by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government do not include women and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence accommodation, those who are sofa surfing or those who are involuntarily sharing unsuitable accommodation in overcrowded circumstances.  I hope for the sake of those experiencing homelessness that this was just another embarrassing gaffe by the Taoiseach and not an honestly-held belief.<\/p><p>What is required is not the normalisation of the homelessness crisis but the building of homes and making them more affordable.  Today's ESRI report, which shows that a 20% increase is likely over the next three years, and the <i>daft.ie<\/i>report, which shows rents increasing by over 11%, indicate that the problem is being compounded.  I ask the Taoiseach to indicate what the Government is doing for people and to address the fact that he believes affordable housing is in the range of &euro;315,000 to &euro;395,000, which he says most people in his constituency could afford.  Does he realise that households would have to have incomes of between &euro;81,000 and &euro;101,000 per year to afford that?  There are many families and households who get up early in the morning but who could never aspire to that type of income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400018#Q01900","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674300,"counter":143,"content":"<p>It is difficult to credit the Taoiseach's claim that the Department is solving the homelessness and housing crisis as a priority given his comments at the weekend.

I will remind him that he said \"Ireland has one of the lowest homelessness [rates] by international standards compared with our peers - they're the stats, we can provide them for you\".  This comment coincides with a shocking and outrageous statement by Mr. Conor Skehan, the head of the Housing Agency, who says we need to stop using words like \"homeless\" and \"crisis\" and recognise that the crisis is \"completely normal\".  That is shocking.  One cannot take seriously the Taoiseach's claim that this is a priority for him or inject the sense of urgency necessary to deal with what is a catastrophic situation if that is the attitude.  Will the Taoiseach withdraw those comments?  Has he seen the statistics provided by Focus, which actually compare us with like comparators in Europe and which were compiled by Professor Eoin O'Sullivan in TCD?  They were put out in the last few days and they show that Ireland actually compares badly and its position is much worse and worsening compared to countries where the data collected are comparable.  I suggest the Taoiseach looks at them.  They show that in comparison with Norway, Finland and Denmark, we have the worst proportion of homelessness by population and that homelessness has increased dramatically under Fine Gael.  We have gone from a position of being better on homelessness in 2008 to being the worst of all of those countries.

The Taoiseach said 80% of news was negative and that it should really be approximately 50% at most.  There will be a new strategy, the third in two years, and I am interested in how that new commitment will be reflected in it.  The Secretary General is supposed to be chairing an interdepartmental group to ensure that the new strategic communications unit will not be politicised.  However, the unit has begun to spend money on advertising and branding before the oversight group has even started its work.  After a lengthy delay, we have received replies to a number of freedom of information requests we submitted concerning the unit.  It will surprise no one that the head of the unit is most frequently in contact with the Taoiseach's political staff.  In fact, emails between the Taoiseach's chief of staff and the head of the unit have been withheld on the basis of a claim that they are part of the deliberative process.  Can the Taoiseach explain why the head of a supposedly non-political unit seems to have more contact with political staff in the Department than with his Civil Service peers?  My overarching concern is what I see as the creeping politicisation of the State service in pursuit of a party political goal, which is something that must be guarded against at all costs.<\/p><p>I echo what other Deputies have said on the housing crisis, which is a scandal, and what they have said about attempts to normalise it.  I do not go for international comparisons or statistics because, every week, I meet people who are in appalling circumstances, from homelessness to the inability to get a house, having to stay with their parents and right along the continuum.  It is everywhere and is a huge blight on our society and on our values as a country.  We should not, in any shape or form, try to trivialise it or use language that understates the reality of the housing scandal for so many families and so many children in our community.  We judge ourselves by our own standards and by what we believe to be best - nothing else.

The Taoiseach is the first prime minister of the EU27 to voice such a view and, in light of the ongoing and accelerating chaos of the British Government, that is a surprising view.

International statistics always come with a health warning and different countries collect statistics in different ways and have different definitions, whether for unemployment, GDP and pretty much everything.  Some countries have a wider definition of homelessness and others have a lesser definition.  The reason we have a body like the OECD is that it compares like with like, to the extent that it is possible.

On &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning I heard that some people believe that children in their adult years and who are living at home with their parents while saving up for a deposit should be considered homeless but I would not agree that somebody living with his or her parents was in the same category as somebody sleeping rough, with both considered homeless.  I was asked a definite question about Ireland being among the highest for homelessness, which it is not.  Nobody is now making that assertion.  It was not an attempt to do anything or to normalise anything or play it down but a simple answer to a straightforward question, something I am often accused of not doing.  I am certainly not interested in debating statistics here with anyone.  I have heard other people doing it in the past few days but I have not got involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400019#R00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674900,"counter":148,"content":"<p>It was the Taoiseach who mentioned statistics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400019#R00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510674900,"counter":149,"content":"<p>The question was about statistics.

I underlined that there could be no return to direct rule as it existed prior to the Good Friday Agreement and that the various provisions of the Agreement would have to be honoured.

The Taoiseach and the Government are not spectators or commentators, nor is the British Prime Minister.  They are all co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, with all the responsibilities that entails.  Over the past ten months the focus of the negotiations has been on the issue of rights which are the norm on the rest of this island and in Britain.  Marriage equality, language rights, the bill of rights, rights to legacy inquests and such things are not only supported by Sinn F&eacute;in but by the majority of those in the Assembly and in wider society.  These rights benefit all sections of society and should threaten no one.  The only reason they are being denied is that the DUP has resisted a rights-based agenda and the British Government has acquiesced in this.<\/p><p>This is compounded by the fact the Tory-DUP pact is in place.  It is completely unacceptable and I hope the Taoiseach has reflected this in his conversations with Theresa May.  Sinn F&eacute;in did so in our conversation with her last week, and it is important that the Government does this on behalf of the Irish State.  The issue of rights is not going away and it needs to be dealt with satisfactorily.  For our part, we have done our best to be flexible and we did our best to stretch ourselves in the common good, and I believe the Taoiseach knows this.  He also knows that in the context of an agreement on the delivery of rights, and these are rights which have already been agreed in previous agreements, Sinn F&eacute;in will enter government.  In the absence of these rights the Executive is not sustainable.  What is now needed is the two Governments to act urgently to deliver equality.  This is their joint responsibility under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is to honour the outstanding commitments and deliver the rights enjoyed by everybody else on these islands to the people of the North who are being denied these rights.  In the absence of doing this, perhaps the Taoiseach will enlighten us on which rights he believes we should forego.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400019#R02000","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510675500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>We now have an imposed budget on Northern Ireland brought about by Secretary of State Brokenshire.

If direct rule is ruled out by the British Government and the Taoiseach, and if no agreement is possible, and we have spent many months seeking such an agreement, between the parties democratically elected in Northern Ireland, what is the path the Taoiseach envisages out of this particular impasse?  The British Labour Party Member of Parliament, Conor McGinn, has said there should not be direct rule from Westminster but that instead we should explore a new partnership arrangement between Dublin and London.

If we are to devise any credible approach in terms of a special economic zone, or reflect the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland in any Brexit solution, then it has to involve a devolved administration, legislature and Executive, through which a special economic zone or something similar could be achieved while respecting the constitutional status of the United Kingdom as contained in the Good Friday Agreement.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have not worked this out.  On the rights issue, it seems a majority in the assembly is now in favour of marriage equality, for example, so if the assembly came back it is quite plausible there would be a vote in favour of marriage equality.  Not having it back is a delay to getting marriage equality through.

Last week, the Taoiseach indicated he felt a breakthrough was on the way.  This was followed very quickly by indications that a breakdown might be on the way.  Within the space of days this is what we were treated to.  Fundamentally, there was an attitude from our Government that it was a matter for the British Government to sort out what special arrangements it may have.  We have a role in thinking through scenarios that could be the solution, particularly for Michel Barnier and his team and the European Commission, who are very consistent in saying they want the rule of EU law to continue to apply.

In terms of our conversations with the UK Government, to the extent we have spoken about special arrangements they are in the context of the paper agreed by the EU 27.  That paper attempts to make real the promises made to us.  We have all heard the language of the past 18 months, that there should be no hard border, no return to the borders of the past and no physical infrastructure along the Border, and we, not as Ireland but as the European Union, and as a negotiating party of 27 with the strength of all of Europe behind us, have set down in writing how we think that can be best achieved.  We are not demanding that the UK or any part of the UK should have to remain in the customs union or the Single Market.  We are, however, saying that if we are to honour this promise and commitment we have been given of avoiding a hard border or a return to the borders of the past there must be regulatory equivalence, if not between the United Kingdom as a whole and the EU then between Northern Ireland and the EU.  It is set out in the paper, which has been extensively leaked at this stage, that the same rulebooks must apply.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, describes this very well.  We cannot have a situation where a factory north of the Border making hair dryers could be given state aid by the UK Government while a factory south of the Border making hair dryers would be forbidden from receiving aid under state aid rules.  We could not have a situation where the CAP in the Republic of Ireland as part of the European Union would require eight inspections a year whereas British or UK deregulation might only require four.  This is what we mean by regulatory equivalence.  It means the rules of the customs union and the Single Market continue to apply, even if the UK and Northern Ireland are not in the customs union.<\/p>  <p>  There are many examples of bespoke arrangements throughout Europe.  The Isle of Man is one small one.  It has never been in the EU or part of the UK.  It does not pay into the EU budget or get anything out of it, but under a protocol to the Treaty of Rome, it, by its own legislation in its own parliament, adopts the rules and regulations of the Single Market and the customs union.  It is a sovereign decision for it to do so because it is its own parliament that does it.  Deputy Martin has touched very accurately on how the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly could be to do something exactly like this.<\/p>  <p>  Our preference, however, is that arrangements which would allow free trade to continue should not just be a special arrangement for Northern Ireland.  We would like these arrangements to apply to the entire United Kingdom because that is what is most important for Irish jobs, the Irish economy, Irish businesses and Irish farmers.  Let us not forget that most of the exports from business and farming in Ireland do not go to Northern Ireland but to England.  A beef farmer's produce is probably going to go to England.  The solution we want is one that protects free trade and free movement for the UK and Ireland and not a special arrangement just for Northern Ireland.  That is a secondary outcome.  It is not the preferred outcome.  It may be better than the worst outcome, but our preferred outcome is an arrangement that allows us to continue to trade and travel freely with all of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland but not just Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>By definition, a special arrangement for Northern Ireland means we are accepting new barriers between Britain and Ireland.  Of course, that is damaging for our farmers, agrifood industry and exporters and also for trade and jobs.  Those who are advocating a special arrangement as a great outcome need to understand they are proposing something very damaging for agrifood, farmers and Irish jobs and businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400020#S00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510676100,"counter":172,"content":"<p>There are no great outcomes from Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400021#T00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1510676100,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Deputy Howlin asked what will happen if the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in fail to form an Executive.

Our exchanges covered bilateral relations, the Brexit negotiations and the future of Europe.  We were each accompanied by a small team of officials and advisers.  The meeting provided a welcome opportunity to review the strong bilateral relations between Ireland and France, which is an important economic partner for us.  Bilateral trade in goods and services between Ireland and France is worth approximately &euro;2 billion every month.  This is a solid platform on which to build and strengthen into the future, especially as Ireland looks to grow and diversify its markets.  We discussed our co-operation in other areas, including Ireland's contribution to the EU training mission in Mali.  We expressed our joint commitment to the planned Celtic interconnector, which will link our electricity networks, improve our connectivity and support export-driven development of Ireland's renewable sector.  This represents the future-oriented agenda we both want to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  President Macron and I welcomed the progress achieved to date in the Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK and the more constructive tone of Prime Minister May in light of her recent speech in Florence.  We agreed that further work is required on the three withdrawal issues - the rights of EU citizens, the UK financial settlement and the Irish-specific issues - before the European Council can decide that sufficient progress has been made to move onto the second phase of the negotiations, which will deal with the future relationship and the transition arrangements.  I thanked President Macron for his understanding and strong support with regard to Irish-specific issues like the common travel area and all the rights associated with it, the Good Friday Agreement and the Border.  I took the opportunity to update him on relevant developments.  We agreed that the 27 member states must remain united.  We expressed our shared hope that it will be possible to make further progress in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  France and Ireland are long-standing partners at EU level, particularly in the area of agriculture.  We work together to protect rural communities and family farms.  On Mercosur, we agreed on the need to protect our vital interests, especially in beef and agriculture, while opening up new export opportunities for our companies.  President Macron and I agreed to stay in close contact on the situation in this regard as it evolves.  As partners and friends, we are ready to discuss issues on which we do not necessarily agree, such as how best to tax Internet firms so that they pay their fair share.  I outlined our view that this is a global issue which should be addressed at a global level and that the best way to achieve a successful outcome is to support the work that is under way at the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, President Macron and I agreed on the enormous potential of the digital economy and the need to ensure Europe provides the right economic environment for it to flourish.  We want to see a dynamic and innovative entrepreneurial climate, with vibrant European companies scaling successfully on international markets.  President Macron has brought a renewed energy to the debate about the future of Europe.  We agreed that Europe needs to demonstrate the capacity to adapt to meet the challenges of the future, such as the digital revolution, the banking union, climate change, migration and security and defence.  As I outlined to the House in my statement after the October European Council, there is a clear willingness among the 27 EU leaders to increase the pace of discussions on this issue while maintaining unity.  We will continue our discussions at the social summit in Gothenburg on Friday during a lunch organised by President Tusk.<\/p>  <p>  In looking to the future, I outlined to President Macron my view that we need to focus on areas in which Europe can have a concrete and positive impact on the lives of citizens, including jobs, growth and investment in the digital Single Market and the Single Market itself.  We discussed our respective plans to bring the debate on Europe to the public through the citizens' dialogue and other mechanisms.  This is extremely important because other more extreme and divisive voices will gain traction unless we can offer an honest, positive and compelling agenda.  My meeting with President Macron was followed by a business event organised by the Irish Embassy in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Bord Bia.  This provided a useful opportunity to meet a range of Irish and French companies across a number of sectors and to discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise for business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400021#T01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510676100,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Obviously, the UK is leaving the EU.  The way things are going, it seems it is about to crash out of the EU.  As a result of the UK's impending departure, the Franco-German axis is moving to centre stage in the context of the future of the European Union.  There are moves for further EU integration.  I am sure the Taoiseach discussed the future of the EU with President Macron.  Ireland should be at the heart of that debate and have a positive input in respect of it.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the Taoiseach and President Macron agreed on many things, but I would like to ask specifically about defence.  Yesterday, 23 member states signed up to the permanent structured co-operation project, which is known as PESCO.  I understand that this new EU defence framework will be launched at next month's EU Council meeting.  What is Ireland's position on this initiative?  What effect will it have on Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality?  Has the Cabinet approved PESCO?  Will the matter come before the D&aacute;il?  To what aspects of PESCO might Ireland subscribe?<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, it seems that he and President Macron also discussed digital taxation and corporate tax harmonisation.  This was probably another issue of difference at last month's meeting.  Did the Taoiseach impress on President Macron that if his vision for digital taxation and corporate tax harmonisation comes to pass, it will threaten Ireland's long-standing economic model and represent a real threat to jobs, growth and living standards in this country?  Can the Taoiseach provide assurances that he impressed on President Macron the importance this country attaches to those issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400021#T01700","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1510676100,"counter":188,"content":"<p>It is good that the Taoiseach met the President of France.<\/p><p>We have had strong relationship with France over the years, particularly in terms of the CAP, although France has always had an envious eye on our corporate tax rates and has made interventions that have periodically reached varying degrees of intensity.  It seems we are now back in a phase where President Macron is focusing on the issue of taxation.  The points raised by Deputy Haughey are important in terms of President Macron's ambitions for Europe and the set of proposals concerning EU reform and development.  President Macron's position is clear, as is the position of many other countries.  What is unclear is Ireland's position.  The Taoiseach has welcomed some of the proposals.  He has said warm things about the general idea of President Macron's moving forward agenda.  However, the Taoiseach has done so in a very vague way and nobody really has any idea as to what is his or Ireland's position.  It is time we had a debate in this House and a proper, detailed examination and, ultimately, articulation of Ireland's position on the agenda for the future of the EU, particularly in a post-Brexit scenario.  I know that a public consultation process is ongoing but that has had very limited impact in more recent times and more innovative ways must be considered.  Fundamentally, this Parliament has a role and we should be engaged with that agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400021#T01800","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510676700,"counter":190,"content":"<p>President Macron has made it clear that he supports, as do a number of other EU leaders, the move towards the creation of an EU army or military intervention force and a shared defence budget.  The PESCO agreement, which they want to sign off on in December, is a step towards that.  What President Macron and other European leaders think is clear.  How does the suggestion that we may sign up to aspects of this agreement square with our tradition and position of military neutrality?  The Taoiseach has made distinctions between a common foreign and security policy and involvement in a European military force or contributing to a defence budget.  However, signing up to an agreement of this nature, a common foreign and security policy and pledges to progressively increase military expenditure hardly seem to be in line with protecting our neutrality, particularly when the architects and supporters of what is proposed are saying explicitly that it is a step towards the creation of a European army and a European common defence.

It appears that there is a growing realisation across the EU that Brexit, particularly on the British Government's terms, is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  The Taoiseach knows that Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying this from the outset.  We see from last week's leaked papers a recognition that cross-Border co-operation is underpinned by EU legislation.  The papers also make it clear that it is essential for the British Government to commit to avoiding a hard border, protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts and ensuring that the rules of the Single Market and the customs union are met.  In our view, the only credible way to achieve this is special status for Northern Ireland within the EU.  In other words, for Northern Ireland to remain within the internal market, the customs union and the EU legal framework.  That would be possible if the Government presses for it in the Brexit negotiations.  Europe is coming around to that view.  The Taoiseach has a responsibility to ensure that this view is progressed and the Government has a responsibility not to waver or deviate from that position.<\/p>  <p>  The British Government needs to start coming up with the goods and putting meat on the bones in terms of what it is suggesting.  It needs to bring forward explicit proposals to ensure that Northern Ireland remains within the Single Market and the customs union.  Will the Taoiseach commit to using the Government's veto on progressing the talks to include the issue of trade if the British Government refuses to seriously deal with this issue?  In our view, the best of way of doing so is special status for Northern Ireland within the EU.  Were these issues raised with President Macron?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400022#U00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510676700,"counter":192,"content":"<p>On PESCO, we have not yet made a decision, either as a Government and as a country, regarding whether we want to participate.  We want to see the full details before we make that decision.  It will require a decision at Cabinet followed by a decision of the D&aacute;il, so there will certainly be consultation with the major Opposition parties before a decision is made.  We are favourably disposed towards it.  I strongly believe that countries need to work together to respond to the new security threats we face in the modern world.  I refer to; international terrorism; cyber attacks, which nearly brought down health IT systems just across the water; uncontrolled mass migration; and trafficking of drugs and people.  All of these things require co-operation across the Continent.  They are not something that any nation state, even a big one, can manage on its own.<\/p><p>We are not going to join a European army, however, or sign up to NATO and neither will we agree to a mutual defence pact, so we shall remain a neutral country.  The triple-lock mechanism will remain in place.  We think that is in our interests as a country.  Ireland is never going to be a military power.  The fact that we are not part of a military alliance gives us more influence in the world for a number of reasons.  However, I do not agree with the assertion that increasing military spending necessarily conflicts with neutrality <i>per se<\/i>.  Lots of other neutral countries spend far more on defence than we do.  In the years ahead, we will need to upgrade our equipment and modernise our Defence Forces.  This is something they very much want.  The impact of pay restoration for members of the Defence Forces will require an increase in spending.  As a result, I do not agree that increasing spending is a bad thing or that it undermines our neutrality.<\/p><p>We affirmed our very strong view that the setting of taxes is a sovereign matter.  While there are a number of European taxes that fund the European budget, national taxes should fund national budgets and it is up to parliaments such as this one to set taxes.  We also reaffirmed our commitment to tax transparency.  Tomorrow, with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, I will launch a public consultation on the future of Europe.  This will be led by the Minister of State.  I would particularly welcome a debate - either in the D&aacute;il or at the Joint Committee on European Affairs - on what should be Ireland's position on the future of Europe debate.  I will indicate my views on the matter in more detail tomorrow but I think I have already done so quite extensively in the House, if people wish to check the record.<\/p><p>It was asked whether I would commit to use or threaten to use the veto.  No, I will not.  I do not think that would be in our interests.  To use the veto would be to set ourselves apart from other countries and to stand alone.  At present, our strength is that we are one of 27 countries and have the support of 26 other countries.  Negotiating as one of those 27 puts us in a much stronger position in our dealings with the UK.  The Sinn F&eacute;in nationalist &quot;ourselves alone&quot; position whereby we should set ourselves apart from our European allies, stand alone and threaten to use the veto would be a really big mistake strategically.  The best way to get the best outcome for Ireland is to continue to part of the 27 ensuring the 27 incorporate into Europe's negotiating position our needs.  If we choose to isolate ourselves, which is very much the Sinn F&eacute;in political philosophy, it would do us serious harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400022#U00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1510677300,"counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400023#V00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1510677300,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Charlie McConalogue - the need for additional funding at Letterkenny University Hospital; (2) Deputies Sean Fleming and Brian Stanley - the future of the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise; (3) Deputy Danny Healy-Rae - the lack of nursing support for sufferers of Parkinson's disease in Kerry; (4) Deputy Bobby Aylward - the need to address overnight ambulance resources in Kilkenny; (5) Deputy Fergus O'Dowd - to discuss protocols and guidelines for employers and employees in the event of status red weather warnings; (6) Deputy John Lahart - to discuss access to services for homeless people in Dublin; (7) Deputies Niamh Smyth and Carol Nolan - the need to address rural crime; (8) Deputy Willie O'Dea - to discuss the defined benefit pension scheme in CI&Eacute;; (9) Deputy Brendan Smith - to discuss the ongoing human rights violations in Myanmar; (10) Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy - the need for investment in the N62 route in County Offaly; (11)Deputy Catherine Murphy - the recent decision on the Celbridge local area plan; (12) Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - to discuss distribution of Garda resources throughout the State; (13) Deputy Frank O'Rourke - the need to review the housing assistance payment limits in north Kildare; (14) Deputy Clare Daly - to discuss the need for legislative reform regarding existing pensioner benefits in cases of scheme wind-ups where at present the purchase of expensive annuities is presented as the only option; (15) Deputy Anne Rabbitte - the need for the Minister for Health to outline when patients who have had operations cancelled owing to building works in Merlin Park University Hospital will receive their treatment; (16) Deputy Pat Buckley - to discuss the need to construct a slip road-feeder lane from the R630 from Whitegate oil refinery to the N25 Cork to Waterford road at Lakeview roundabout; (17) Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin - the reinstatement of the Coughlanstown Road, Ballymore Eustace, County Kildare; (18) Deputy Martin Ferris - full-time residential care for adults with physical and intellectual disabilities; (19) Deputy Mattie McGrath - the costs associated with primary school teacher placements in the Gaeltacht; (20) Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Joan Collins, Mick Wallace - the recent report on spiralling rent and house prices; today's report by<i>Daft.ie<\/i>on soaring rents and rental properties; the ESRI report which states house prices will rise by 20% in the next three years; and the Government's response to same; (21) Deputy Stephen S.

The position is as follows.<\/p><p>Under pillar 1, my Department is finalising a draft of a Creative Children plan for the period 2018 to 2022 in conjunction with the Departments of Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council.  I expect that will be launched later this year.  With regard to pillar 2, culture teams have been established in each of the 31 local authorities and each local authority produced a culture and creativity plan for 2017.  Each local authority is now in the process of drawing up five-year strategic creativity plans which will be published in early 2018.  The first Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca was launched on Easter Monday with the theme inclusion and diversity and work is now under way to develop our approach to Cruinni&uacute; in 2018.

Work is progressing on the preparation of a plan for Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, television drama and animation in accordance with pillar 4.  A unified international identity and communications programme for Ireland was rolled out under pillar 5.  This includes a new portal website for Ireland, <i>www.ireland.ie<\/i>, which has been viewed more than 2 million times around the world.  <\/p><p>A forum entitled, Culture, Wellbeing and the Creative Society, Building the Policy Agenda, will take place on 13 December in Dublin Castle.

Currently, the short-stay ward is being used temporarily for rehabilitation service patients while refurbishments are carried out in the rehab unit in St. Conal's hospital campus.  Previously, the short-stay ward was operating as a full ward of the hospital pending the reopening of the haematology-oncology ward, in which there were 11 beds, as well as the coronary care unit, which had eight beds.  Those two wards opened in summer, following the flooding, and the beds and staff from the short-stay ward transferred to the two newly-opened wards.  That meant the short-stay ward was vacant.  Since then, it has been used for rehabilitation patients who are due to return to St. Conal's by the end of December when the ward will, once again, be vacant and available for use.<\/p>  <p>  To bring the short-stay ward into use to provide the 20 beds requires staffing.  In June 2017, hospital management in Letterkenny submitted a request to the HSE for approval for the staff required to open the short-stay ward and provide the additional 20 beds.  If open, the ward would enhance the hospital's capacity from 330 patients to 350.  To bring that about, funding of &euro;1.8 million was sought to hire 17 additional nurses, six health care assistants and four other staff.  As the Minister of State knows from his work in the Department of Health, it takes time to put staff in place.  Once approval is secured, it takes weeks or months to get to a situation where beds can be reopened.  It usually takes at least four months.  Nevertheless, Letterkenny has still not received approval from the HSE or, in particular, from the Government, which is responsible for providing the funding to the HSE to enable that to happen.  As a result, 23 patients are waiting on trolleys for admission to Letterkenny University Hospital today.  Yesterday, there were 25 such patients.<\/p>  <p>  Since January 2017, 4,000 patients have had to wait on trolleys for access to a hospital bed.  They were admitted by accident and emergency department consultants but no beds were available on 4,000 occasions so far this year.  That is an increase from 2016, when just over 1,200 patients were obliged to wait on trolleys.  As such, the numbers increased almost two and a half times between 2016 and 2017.  The hospital's assessment shows that, on average, approximately 20 additional beds are required at a given time.  The proposal put forward would deal with that and provide the additional beds.  However, that will only happen if the Government gets its act together and provides the required funding.  Why has the Minister of State sat on this for the last number of months?  Even if the funding is given now, we will have to wait a further period because of the inaction of the Government regarding the approval.  Can the Minister of State inform the House today whether the funding will be provided immediately and state that every effort will be made to ensure the additional 20 beds will be available at Letterkenny University Hospital after Christmas for Donegal patients?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400032#EE00700","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1510682700,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McConalogue for raising this important matter.  First, I am delighted that as part of the budget 2018 announcements, &euro;40 million in additional finding was provided for winter pressures in 2017 and a further &euro;90 million for measures to improve access to scheduled and unscheduled care in 2018.  As such, we are planning for these particular issues.  This is a signal of the commitment of the Government to invest in hospital services, provide additional supports during the winter period, increase hospital capacity and reduce waiting times for hospital procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding for winter preparedness will be allocated to a range of measures.  I confirm that &euro;5 million of the funding for 2017 will be focused on supporting patients to return home, or to an appropriate community setting where clinically appropriate, by providing 45 additional home-care packages and 20 additional transitional care beds per week over the winter period.  These measures have already been rolled out to targeted hospitals nationally, thus helping to alleviate some of the pressures hospitals are experiencing at present.  Funding will also be provided to increase bed capacity this winter and, moving forward, as part of service planning for 2018.  The Department of Health is also undertaking a health service capacity review in line with the programme for a partnership Government commitment.  The review's findings, which are due to be published before the end of the year, will provide an evidence base regarding future capacity.  In addition, I confirm to the Deputy that all hospital groups and community health organisations have developed and put in place integrated winter preparedness plans for their localities with a focus on planning for periods of escalation, maintaining patient-flow processes and ensuring public health preparedness.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn to the question raised regarding Letterkenny University Hospital.  I am aware that a proposal for additional beds in Letterkenny has been submitted to the HSE by the Saolta hospital group.  This proposal will be assessed by the HSE in line with current financial and procurement processes and a decision will be made thereafter.  In general, there is no doubt that too many patients continue to wait on trolleys for admission to hospital on a daily basis within our health service.  I acknowledge the distress that long wait-times in emergency departments cause for patients and their families, including in Letterkenny.  The public hospital system is seeing a growing demand for care and Letterkenny follows this trend.  This year, accident and emergency attendances at Letterkenny had increased by more than 1% by the end of September, including an almost 5% increase in emergency department attendances by people over 75 years.  Notwithstanding the pressure on Letterkenny emergency department, it is worth noting that patient experience times in Letterkenny are above the national average, meaning that patients complete their episode of care more quickly in Letterkenny emergency department.  I compliment and thank the staff for that.<\/p>  <p>  I conclude by noting the commitment of this Government to develop and improve services at Letterkenny University Hospital as evidenced by the significant level of investment in capital projects in recent years.  These developments include multiple remedial works following flooding in 2013, a new state-of-the-art blood science laboratory in 2015 and a new medical academy and a clinical skills laboratory, both of which were opened last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400032#EE00800","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1510682700,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

They were bewildered earlier in the weekend as to who advises the Taoiseach and who thought it would be a good idea for him to take a picture of himself putting a spoon into a dishwasher or shared pictures of his \"Mr. Taoiseach\" mug and another pair of the array of coloured socks he has been receiving from various companies.  These were all photo stunts to convince the population that the Taoiseach has a personality and is one of us but all obliterated by the remarks made by the housing Minister and repeated at the party conference by the Taoiseach.  It seems Fine Gael are homelessness deniers.  The party's members were not willing to debate the most pressing social issue at the party conference, meaning that the main Government party was sending out the message \"Crisis; what crisis?\"  This was followed, disgracefully, by a well-paid Government adviser, Mr. Skehan, whose services are paid for by the taxpayer, going on national radio to say that the poor will always be with us.  It is quite incredible and these stark examples bring it home to people that nobody in the Government seems to care or to recognise the scale of this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal with the figures.  The OECD is probably a good place to start when it comes to comparing figures.  It estimates six core forms of homelessness.  Most countries count some but not all of the core forms and Ireland uses the narrowest definition, only counting three out of six categories, while 18 out of 30 countries count more than that.  Ireland only counts three: sleeping rough, emergency accommodation and homeless accommodation.  The Irish system does not count people in institutions, such as the cancer sufferer in my constituency who is in a convalescent home and who cannot be released because he has nowhere to go.  It does not count non-conventional dwellings, such as caravans or mobile homes, which are very common, sheds in back gardens or tents.  It does not count people living temporarily in conventional housing with family and friends due to the lack of housing, which is probably most of the people we come across at our constituency offices.  Very few of these are counted but if they were, the figures for homelessness would be multiples of what they are.  The other sleight of hand was using two-year old figures - from 2015 - even though the rate of homelessness has almost doubled in two years.<\/p>  <p>  Even if all the figures the Government provided are accurate and we are in a great position by international standards, what comfort will that be to any person who is actually homeless tonight?  Should the woman from Blanchardstown, which is my area and in the Taoiseach's constituency, who is bringing several children to three different schools from a bed and breakfast in Gardiner Street take comfort in the statement that we are doing well by international standards?  This is an attempt to normalise homelessness and state that it is acceptable.  This is what Mr. Skehan's comments were about.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that homelessness is an international phenomenon and that the Government adheres to a neoliberal philosophy which dominates many administrations.  This philosophy states that public housing is to be minimised and spending on it is to be slashed.  The right to a home does not count for anything any more.  One trips over homeless people in America, the richest country in the world, but that is nothing to boast about.  It is incredible that the Minister thinks it was apt to state this at his party conference.  People now see the reality of the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400033#FF00900","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1510683300,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to elaborate upon the comments that were made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, at the weekend in respect of lreland's rate of homelessness and to clarify the technical issues associated with making international comparisons.  The Taoiseach is very well informed about the situation relating to housing and homelessness.  He has immersed himself fully in our Department's brief, along with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in the past number of months and has attended a housing summit.  He has worked with the Minister to ensure that we get extra money, with over &euro;500 million allocated in the budget.  We have secured over &euro;6 billion of taxpayers' money to spend on this matter in the years ahead.  The spend next year will be close to &euro;2 billion.  The Taoiseach is very well informed and very much aware that the position is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and the Minister are correct that Ireland's rate of homelessness is low by international standards, including among EU member states and by comparison to our nearest neighbours.  It is also important to acknowledge that bringing clarification to this issue is not to suggest that any excuses are being made for the number of households that are currently without permanent accommodation.  Let me be crystal clear: the levels of homelessness we are currently experiencing in this country, including recent increases, are absolutely unacceptable.  No one is disputing that and the Taoiseach, the Minister, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, and I have said it repeatedly.<\/p><p>The figures are there for everyone to see and no one is hiding from this.  We have consistently said we will spend money on fixing this over a period but we cannot fix it in a week.  We are certainly not hiding from the facts.<\/p> <p> It is not good enough that more than 3,000 children are without permanent homes, that families are residing in hotels or that individuals are sleeping on the streets of our cities.  However, neither is it acceptable to hear commentators talking down our country.  Over the past two years we have seen this narrative reflected in the national media.  It has been claimed that homelessness in Ireland is at its worst since the Famine and that we have a crisis that is the worst in Europe.  Assertions have been made to the effect that homelessness in Ireland is at such crisis levels that we should be excused from the requirements of EU law in responding.<\/p> <p> Some of this narrative has seeped into international coverage of our housing system, and it is damaging to Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation that our social response to this issue is being portrayed as dysfunctional.  As Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la we have a responsibility in this regard, and the good work being done in difficult circumstances needs to be recognised.  We compliment the good work that is being done through all our local authorities, housing agencies, approved housing bodies and NGOs working in the sector, which spend a great deal of money tackling this issue.  Some of it is taxpayers' money but some they raise themselves.  They work night after night to provide services to people who are homeless and to help us find solutions for them.  We cannot consistently undermine the great work they do.<\/p> <p> There are a number of readily available international comparative studies on homelessness, which illustrate Ireland's position in this regard.  One such report is that produced recently by the OECD, which sees Ireland in the top tier of 30 international nations.  One of the most comprehensive EU comparisons ever carried out by the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless found Ireland to have one of the lowest rates of homelessness among member states.  Of course, these comparisons need to be contextualised.  Direct international comparisons are difficult because of the availability, type, quality and consistency of data in different countries.  Some commentators say this lack of international uniformity means that we should not view Ireland&rsquo;s favourable position in a positive light.  However, Ireland is a world leader in the production of consistent and timely quality data.  The homelessness data that is available for Ireland is not contested by our homeless services sector, as it is for many other nations where governments are accused of ignoring homelessness or underplaying the figures, which we certainly do not.  When we accept the fact the data available for Ireland is timely, consistent and comprehensive then we can understand that, even despite the definitional variations that may arise in comparisons, it is clear that Ireland&rsquo;s homeless rate is not extraordinary, and is actually considerably lower than many other countries that are comparable in socioeconomic and cultural terms.<\/p> <p> I will now provide a direct comparison between our homeless rates and those in England and Scotland.  These two nations also put considerable effort into monitoring homelessness and producing data, and so a direct comparison is possible.  Based on the most recent reports, which were for September, there are 8,374 individuals, men, women and children, residing in emergency accommodation.  These individuals equate to approximately 4,600 households.  Based on census data from 2016, we had a national population of 4.76 million, broken down into 1.7 million households.  A household can be a single person living alone or two or more persons living together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400033#FF01000","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510683900,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I must interrupt the Minister of State because he does not have time now.

As I explained at the outset, Ireland uses fewer categories when it comes to evaluating homelessness.  The figures for the UK, our nearest neighbour, refer to the number of households applying for housing assistance to local authorities.  Such households are accepted as being in the statutory homelessness category during the year of reference.  We do not do this.  The figures of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government do not count rough sleeping either.  Perhaps they are added somewhere else but they are not counted officially on the Department's website.  It only deals with those in emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  We could argue until the cows come home, but everybody knows that 464 public houses were built last year.  In the 1970s, 8,000 or 9,000 were routinely built each year.  This morning, as people got up, they were told that house prices are to increase by 20% in the next couple of years because there is no affordable housing and there is not enough housing for the growing population.  The Minister of State can argue all he likes.  What was most pertinent about the comments the Taoiseach made at the weekend is that they revealed a real belief.  They were backed up later by Mr. Skehan, who is a Government adviser.  How can we have somebody heading up the Housing Agency who thinks the poor will always be with us and that we should not get emotional about homelessness?  I wish he would tell that to the people I meet every day in the Dublin West constituency, which is a black spot for homelessness because of our young migrant and very transient population.  People do not have anywhere to live.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State also mentioned the census.  Huge numbers of young people aged under 30 are stuck at home.  Almost 500,000 of them cannot get out from under their parents' feet and create independent lives for themselves.  They are not counted as being homeless either, but they are also in housing need.  We were told it would take 40 years to clear the housing waiting list if we wait for the Government, with its neoliberal philosophy, and capitalism to solve the problem.  A complete change is required.

The Deputy is right to say that the number of those rough sleeping in England, namely, 4,134 people, is also very high.  When the census was taken, the figure in Ireland was 123.  The count of rough sleepers taken twice a year estimates the number approximately 130 or 140.  It might be slightly higher.  We try to monitor this figure, deal with it and be very clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400034#GG00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1510683900,"counter":375,"content":"<p>So the Government is doing a good job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400034#GG00500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1510683900,"counter":376,"content":"<p>We provide emergency accommodation and we will provide an increased number of emergency beds in the months ahead to allow for potentially cold weather.<\/p>  <p>  We are not saying that it is acceptable.

We have put in the resources to fix it.  The Deputy, the committee and many others wanted the Government to commit to 10,000 social houses a year.  This is exactly what we are doing.

Per working day, approximately 85 people are given housing solutions.  Next year, the figure will be approximately 100.  In the year gone by, more than 3,000 people left an emergency homeless situation and went into a house.  We are making some progress.  We say every week that we know it is not enough and we have to do more.  We have put more money into it and we are trying many new measures, including direct build, leasing, acquiring vacant properties and bringing empty properties back into use.

The N62 is a critical artery through Offaly and the midlands.  It links the M6 at Athlone and continues to the M7 at Roscrea and the M8 at Horse and Jockey.  It is crucial that the road, which is a national secondary road, be maintained to the highest possible standard because we require it to ensure we can develop our social, economical and cultural offerings in the area.  We need access to our power station, forestry and for industrial purposes.  We need access to develop the rural economy.  We have a very good business park in Ferbane, which has a food campus, and we need good access there.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, some parts of the road are deteriorating, particularly in Ferbane as one heads out of the town towards the Gallen Priory nursing home.  A significant piece of the road really and truly is in a dreadful state and needs to be upgraded.  We then move onto the roundabout at Cloghan, which is in a particularly poor state.  I understand a design has been drafted for public consultation.  Good consultation will find an agreement on the design because a solution needs to be found.  It is an unusual junction with five roads leading into it.  Another measure is required at Boolinarig Cross, which is a very unsafe junction.  The speed of traffic along that route means it is frightening to try to exit from those two routes onto the junction.<\/p><p>A number of people are living along those two routes.  There is a lot of agricultural activity and ordinary domestic activity along them.  A total reconfiguration of that junction is required to help people to exit onto the N62.  I understand there has been a little bit of work on it in the past.  Agreements with landowners have been negotiated or are certainly in progress.  It seems to me that this junction should be prioritised.  Further south on the N62, there are concerns about access onto the N52 at Kennedy's Cross.  Perhaps that could be examined as well.<\/p> <p> I want to impress on the Minister the importance of the N62 to west and south County Offaly.  When I was on the midlands regional authority many years ago, we looked at a development plan for the midlands region.  There seemed to be a drive to downgrade the N62 at that time.  I am glad this did not happen.  Along with the other councillors who were members of the authority, I fought to make sure the N62 retained its status as a national secondary route.  If that status was allowed to deteriorate, it would be terribly damaging to those of us who live in the area.  I must acknowledge that some excellent work has been done on the N62 between Cloghan and Ferbane in recent years.  The hard shoulders on that stretch of the road are very narrow, however.  I know it is particularly challenging because of the peat foundation.  There have been occasions when large vehicles have been pulled off that road, in effect.  That has not happened of late, thankfully, but it has been an issue in the past.  I impress on the Minister the need to prioritise the N62 in the interests of the west Offaly area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400034#GG01100","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510684500,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I appreciate the importance she attaches to the development of the roads in her locality.  When I visited the area recently, the Deputy helpfully and kindly showed me the dangerous roads in respect of which measures are needed.  We will look seriously at such measures.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am responsible for overall policy for and funding of the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII within its capital budget and in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act 1993.  Ireland has a road network of just under 100,000 km.  The maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer.  The national financial position led to large reductions in the amounts of Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure in the years of financial crisis.  For this reason, there has been a focus on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvements in recent years.  I envisage that the emphasis on maintaining current assets will continue into the next capital plan period.  The 2016-21 capital plan, Building on Recovery, and the capital plan review allocations mark a significant step forward in restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady-state condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes.  The allocations and planned projects for the first years of the proposed ten-year capital investment plan will align with the existing capital plan as supplemented as part of the capital plan review.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from TII that it has invested approximately &euro;8.3 million in upgrade works on the N62 in County Offaly since 2012.  Additional funding of &euro;369,000 has been provided by TII for road safety improvement schemes on the route.  I accept the Deputy's argument that this is not enough.  I acknowledge that further great improvements are needed on this road.  After ten years of retrenchment, there are many potential national, regional and local road improvement projects across the country.  The scope for progressing new road improvement projects will depend on the capital funding allocated to the Department under the proposed ten-year capital investment plan.  As there are many competing demands, the appraisal and prioritisation of projects in line with the requirements of the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework will be central to assessing which suitable major and minor national road projects can be advanced.  We will bear in mind the high priority the Deputy has attached to this road and the excellent case she has made for it this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400035#HH00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1510684500,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister will not mind if I take advantage of his presence in the Chamber by mentioning the N52 in the hope that we might get a link from Kilbeggan to Tullamore.  The Minister will appreciate the importance of this project in light of his recent visit to the area.  I remind him, in the context of the specific improvement grants he mentioned in his response, that many roads in west and east Offaly are built on peat foundations.  According to the guidelines on the rehabilitation of roads over peat, such roads require works to be carried out on them four to five times more often than roads that are not founded on peat.  We can see as we traverse the county that the current funding allocation is not really sufficient to cover all the roads built on peat foundations.  I can clearly see the deterioration in roads built on cutaway bogs.  I would also like to take advantage of the Minister's presence by mentioning the inner relief road that is required in Edenderry.  He will be aware of the work that Offaly County Council has put into this 1 km stretch of road.  It is ready to proceed.  I would also like to mention the R400 from Rhode to Portarlington, which is part of the link between the M6 and M7 motorways.  Rhode business campus is accessed from this strategic route.

If there is a safety issue, that is certainly a matter of great priority.  That will always be an issue I will consider very seriously.  If the Deputy can point particularly to road fatalities, I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of TII, which is making road safety a priority above everything else on the instigation of many people in this House and my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400035#HH00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Crime","time":1510684500,"counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400035#HH00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1510684500,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Deputies Niamh Smyth and Carol Nolan are sharing time on the final Topical Issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400035#HH00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1510684500,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for being in attendance for this debate on the important issue of rural crime.  A public meeting was held last night in County Offaly to highlight an issue that has become an epidemic nationwide, unfortunately.  I will give two small examples from my constituency.  In recent months, there have been eight break-ins at people's homes across an area from Clones, County Monaghan to Mountain Lodge, County Cavan.  These crimes happened in broad daylight, generally between early morning and lunchtime.  The last of the break-ins in question affected the McGinn family.  Luckily, the children were at school when this happened.  This young couple had left their house earlier that day to go somewhere.  When they came back at lunchtime, they found three men - criminals - ransacking their home.  They arrived at the back door to find a man standing there with a hurley stick, ready to attack whoever got in his way.<\/p><p>Again in the Cootehill area, the home of a couple in their early 70s was one of 16 homes and businesses that were broken into in the past number of weeks.  Criminality is on the rise.  That particular couple had to barricade their farm machinery and equipment and almost barricade themselves into their home and farmyard.  On three occasions during the past couple of weeks, that one farmyard and house was broken into, with attempted robbery on one occasion while equipment was stolen on two occasions.  A total of 16 homes and businesses within an eight-mile radius of Cootehill were affected.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has just left the House.  He was lucky enough to get Stepaside Garda station reopened.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht represents this constituency and Cootehill is her home base.  Cootehill Garda station has restricted opening hours.  It is not a 24-hour station.  It borders Cavan and Monaghan.  Given the statistics I am providing, which are factual, we need that station to be open on a 24-hour basis.  Garda resources are starved in this area and we need them to be replenished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400035#HH00700","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510685100,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Rural crime is definitely increasing regardless of statistics.

This is spiralling out of control.  We need resources.  People are living in terror.  There are reports of farmers bringing firearms into their bedrooms at night in order to protect themselves.  There will be an escalation of this.  We need more garda&iacute; on the ground.  We do not need to hear about the reopening of Templemore.  We want to see the results of that.

I assure the Deputies that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carefully monitors the activities of criminal groups affecting all areas of the country and is implementing strong policing measures to disrupt and dismantle their networks.  The Deputies will appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner and his management team who are responsible for the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas.  However, l am advised that Garda management constantly monitors the distribution of resources in light of crime trends and overall policing needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of &euro;100 million announced in budget 2018 to support large-scale policing operations, including Operation Thor.  It is also worth noting that Operation Thor has now entered its winter phase, which will run from 29 October 2017 to 1 April 2018.  The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity resulting to date in over 92,040 targeted checkpoints and 71,700 crime prevention patrols nationwide.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,130 arrests and 6,920 charges covering a range of offences, which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen properly, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Operation Thor has targeted mobile criminal gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes and it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  The Deputies will be aware that the CSO official recorded crime statistics for 2016 show a decrease in burglary offences of 30% when compared to the previous 12-month period in 2015.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  Furthermore, crime prevention officers actively engage with community groups to promote the Safer Communities campaign and advise residents of ways to increase their personal safety and secure their property.<\/p>  <p>  I listened with care to what the Deputies said this evening, particularly to what Deputy Smyth said about her area of Cavan and Monaghan and to what Deputy Nolan had to say about County Offaly.  I acknowledge the horrific and totally unacceptable assault on Richie McKelvey in south Offaly and offer my condolences and the condolences and sympathies of Deputy Corcoran Kennedy on what was an unacceptable act.  We are in constant contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure those responsible for these unacceptable acts are brought to justice.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the concerted strategy to combat burglary, the Government has made it a priority to secure the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015.  The provisions are now available to garda&iacute; to support prosecutions arising from Operation Thor.  Furthermore, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, has commenced.  This Act introduced the DNA database, which provides garda&iacute; with investigative links, or hits, between people and unsolved crimes, including burglaries.  It is anticipated that this will assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years.  I assure the Deputies that I take these issues extremely seriously and that under my watch, I will ensure, as Minister for Justice and Equality in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that there will be no hiding place in any part of rural Ireland for people engaged in criminal activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400036#JJ00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1510685100,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I sense from what the Minister has said today that there will be zero tolerance for criminality in rural areas.  However, I must say that the McGinn family in Mountain Lodge and the McPhillips family in Kill do not feel the benefits of Operation Thor.  The McGinns were faced with a criminal standing at their back door with a hurley in his hand and had to wait 40 minutes for a Garda car to come from Carrickmacross, which is in a different county.  As I said earlier, Cootehill Garda station has restricted hours so there was nobody available at that time and the McGinns had to wait 40 minutes for a Garda car to arrive.  Three hours later, those criminals were seen crossing the Border into a different jurisdiction and had not been apprehended at any point in their spree of break-ins from Clones to Mountain Lodge in County Cavan.  Operation Thor certainly does not hold any weight for those people at the coalface.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the Minister on the CCTV scheme, which has huge potential.  However, from working with community groups on the ground, I am hearing that the application form is cumbersome.  There are restrictions around Garda stations and council buildings in the community.  The communities affected by this such as Ballyhaise and Bailieborough do not have council offices for monitoring and storing data.  The scheme needs to be rolled out in a more fluid way so that communities can access the funding.  They badly need it and are willing to work and supply the application form.

I am introducing to the House a short but very important Bill.  It is designed to address a specific failing in our current legislation on drink-driving.  We all know that alcohol and driving do not mix.  Drink driving is one of the most serious causes of collisions, injuries and fatalities on our roads.  No one disputes that.  There is also general agreement that the law must be firm on drink-driving.  It must take drink-driving seriously and it must be seen to take it seriously.  It is now seven years since the law on drink-driving was comprehensively revised and updated.  The legislation involved - the Road Traffic Act 2010 - has generally served us well.  It provides a framework of graded offences.  At the most serious are cases where people are, as the law states, under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of controlling the vehicle.  These are cases where a person has drink or drugs taken and can be proven to be impaired and unable to control the vehicle.  Also serious, but a lesser offence, is being over a specified limit of alcohol.  In this case, the offence is driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while over the alcohol limit.  There is no requirement to prove impairment.  One of the big controversies in 2010 was that the alcohol limit was being lowered.  We were told this was excessive and that it would destroy social life in the country.  It was not and it has not.  On the contrary, lower alcohol limits have contributed to saving lives and have helped to impress on people the dangers of drinking and driving.  Even a small amount of alcohol can impact on driver&rsquo;s reaction time and hazard perception.  While drivers in this situation may not have obvious impairment, the impact of alcohol on their reactions could be the difference between life and death.<\/p>  <p>  The law on drink-driving which we introduced in 2010 contains a significant flaw.  There was a general principle which was supposed to apply to drink-driving and to all serious road traffic offences.  Committing a serious offence was destined to lead to a period of disqualification from driving.  In spite of this principle, it was decided in 2010 - to appease publican lobby groups - to allow some drinkers found over the legal limit to escape disqualification.  This is a tragic mistake.  Such appeasement of a powerful lobby, such as the publicans, cannot be right.  Either any drink-driving over the legal limit is a serious matter or it is not.  If it is, how can we not have a disqualification?  We disqualify people who drive dangerously or carelessly.  We disqualify people for driving dangerously defective vehicles.  We disqualify people for dangerous parking during lighting up hours.  Ireland has had a mixed record in recent years.  We even disqualify people for driving without insurance.  What possible rationale can there be for saying to some people who drive while over the legal alcohol limit that we are not going to disqualify them?  Do we really mean to say that a person driving on a road while over the alcohol limit is less of an immediate danger to public safety than someone who is parking dangerously?  Are they posing less of a danger to public safety than someone who has no insurance?  The fact that it is only some people in this position who get the exemption from disqualification serves to underline the fact that driving when over the limit merits disqualification.  The law already recognises that this offence should normally attract disqualification.  There is no logic to the proposition that in some cases some people should get a waiver on the disqualification and be allowed to pay a &euro;200 fine, get three penalty points and drive on as if nothing had happened.<\/p>  <p>  I will put this issue in a broader context.  It is almost a clich&eacute; in the area of road safety that there are many factors involved and many different measures needed in order to promote road safety.  It is a clich&eacute; because it is true.  Ireland&rsquo;s current road safety strategy, as its predecessors, sets out actions across a whole range of areas which must be addressed if we are to achieve what we all want, which is to make our roads safer and to reduce deaths and injuries on our roads.  Deputies will know that Ireland has a mixed record in the last few years on road safety.  For a good many years road deaths were dropping from the peak of 472 in 1997 to the historic low of 162 in 2012.  Since then, we have seen fluctuations.  There was a significant increase in 2013, a smaller increase in 2014, a drop to 162 in 2015 and an increase again in 2016.  Current indicators are of a very welcome drop in the number of deaths for 2017 with today&rsquo;s figure standing at 133, which is 31 fewer fatalities than the same period in 2016.  That is still 133 too many.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the major issues to be addressed have been addressed.  The NCT has helped to ensure vehicle standards are higher and driver training has improved.  The introduction of penalty points in 2002 and the strengthening of the penalty points system have all had an impact on people's behaviour.  Many more measures are in train under the road safety strategy and will continue to be so in the future.  Road safety, as I have said many times, should not be a matter of politics or of ideology.  It should be an issue that crosses party lines.  We all agree on the goal of making our roads safer and most of the time we agree on the means.  There are debates and disagreements, but they are over practicalities, whether a particular measure will work, or how it can be made to work better.<\/p>  <p>  For the many factors involved in road safety and in road deaths, we must have many measures, which we do.  The road safety strategy continues to address vehicle standards, driver education and enforcement.  In all of these areas we need and do have continuing efforts, not least because as the number of road deaths has gone down, the causes behind those remaining deaths are more intractable.<\/p>  <p>  Drink-driving has always been one of the major factors in road traffic collisions.  The RSA has found that alcohol is a factor in 38% of road deaths, a figure which is based on coroners&rsquo; reports into road deaths.  We should think about that figure of 38%.  In spite of what we know about drink-driving and all of the public awareness campaigns, alcohol is still a factor in more than a third of road traffic deaths.<\/p><p>Last year when the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and the ICMSA commissioned an opinion survey on this issue, almost 23% of those polled admitted to driving after three or more pints.  I believe anyone would conclude that the real figure must be higher, if we include those who drink and drive but do not admit it.  Even a figure of nearly 23% is disturbingly high.  Particularly worrying is that research by the RSA and separate research by the AA have shown that drink-driving is increasing among younger drivers.  That is a surprise but it is the truth.<br\/><br\/>Drink-driving is not just dangerous; it continues to be a significant factor in road deaths in Ireland.  It is a problem which is growing.  Not many years ago it had become commonplace to say rather smugly that we were witnessing a culture change, that drink-driving was no longer socially acceptable.  If that was true, it is not any longer.  The trend is reversing and we need to get it back on course.  How can we do so if the very law we make treats some drink-driving cases as not being serious enough to merit the smallest disqualification?<br\/><br\/>The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 deals with one very specific and very important amendment.  It will remove the provision of the Road Traffic Act 2010 - a provision which should never have been introduced - which allows some people who drive while over the alcohol limit to get away without any disqualification.  This provision is bad in itself, because it treats a serious offence as if it is not serious.  It is worse if we remember that it sends a message that the law does not take &quot;a little drink-driving&quot; seriously.<br\/><br\/>Let me remind the House what the provision in section 29 of the 2010 Act states.  Section 29 deals with drivers other than learners, novices, and professional drivers.  Offences concerned with alcohol limits divide in seriousness according to the amount of alcohol a person has in his or her blood, breath or urine.  Section 29 applies to people who have up to 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood or are in the equivalent brackets for breath or urine.  Under section 29, these people are first served with a fixed-penalty notice, rather than with a summons to court.  This offers an administrative system as an alternative to court proceedings, with which I have no difficulty.<br\/><br\/>The problem arises with the consequences for drivers.  Under section 29, if a person is between 80 and 100 mg per 100 ml they get a six-month disqualification.  If they are between 50 and 80 mg per 100 ml, they can choose to accept three penalty points.  Let us consider what this means.  It takes 12 penalty points for someone to get a six-month disqualification.  I am quite happy to accept that the consequence of being in a lower bracket of alcohol should be lower but the law as it stands provides that a person in the lower bracket is not automatically disqualified and gets three points, or a quarter of what it takes to reach a disqualification under the penalty point system.  How can that be justified as a consequence of driving above the legal amount of alcohol taken?<br\/><br\/>The Bill will remove this anomaly.  In place of the relatively trivial three penalty points, there will be a three-month disqualification.  This is a short period but it is a disqualification.  It is short because it is in the lowest bracket of those over the alcohol limit.  Anything less would simply say - as the law so regrettably does at present - that a little alcohol over the legal limit before driving is not a serious matter.<br\/><br\/>The Bill has provoked a great deal of comment.  It has been strongly supported by road-safety advocacy groups including the Irish Road Victims Association and the PARC Road Safety Group.  The Road Safety Authority, the Automobile Association and Drinkaware have also been strongly supportive.  A survey of public opinion conducted just after this proposal was announced found that 91% of the public supported the view that there should be automatic disqualification for all drivers detected driving over the limit.  Deputies may be interested to note that these figures broke down into 93% in rural areas and 89% in urban areas.<br\/><br\/>While there has been support from victims groups, road safety advocates and the public at large, there has also been criticism.  Some of the initial criticisms were based on a misunderstanding, which has hopefully been cleared up.  Some people seemed to think that the Bill would lower the alcohol limits further.  That was never the intention and hopefully that message has been made clear.  The Bill will not lower the alcohol limits; it will ensure proper consequences for people who breach the existing limits.<br\/><br\/>There have been those who claimed that this Bill will not save a single life.  They could not be more wrong.  To give an idea of the scale of the issue, in the years from 2012 to 2016 inclusive, 3,003 fixed-penalty notices issued to drink-drivers in the 51 mg to 80 mg alcohol concentration bracket.  This is the number of people facing the prospect of penalty points instead of a disqualification.  Not only is it a significant number but there was a notable increase during 2016.  This fits with other evidence of a reversal in the previous trend towards people seeing drink-driving as unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>There is also the question of actual deaths.  The RSA has found that between 2008 and 2012 at least 35 people died in collisions where drivers had alcohol levels at between 21 mg and 80 mg.  Of these, 16 were in the 50 mg to 80 mg range.  If we had taken drink-driving, even at what we call low levels, more seriously, these 16 people might be alive.  How can people claim that ensuring proper consequences for drink-driving at these levels will not save lives?  They may say that drink-driving is not the only issue, or that this Bill does not address every aspect of drink-driving, but no one ever claimed that it did.  What it does is address a serious flaw in our current law.  It will make sure that what is already illegal will carry the consequences it should.<br\/><br\/>There is also the question of how we address the culture change we so badly need.  This Bill alone will not solve the problem of drink-driving as a growing phenomenon but it will help a great deal to underline that drink-driving is never acceptable, and if we leave the law as it is, that law will continue to puncture arguments against drink-driving because the law of the land will continue to say that a little alcohol before driving is no great harm.<br\/><br\/>Most of the opposition to this Bill has, as Deputies will by now be aware, come from people who argue that it will somehow undermine social life in rural areas.  The Bill has been presented as an urban versus rural issue.  None of this stands up to examination.  I have already mentioned the survey which found overwhelming support across the country.  This is not surprising; rural Ireland has suffered disproportionately from alcohol-related road deaths.  Some 81% of alcohol-related road deaths occur in rural Ireland.  Those who portray this Bill as an attack on rural Ireland are missing the point.  We want to save lives in rural Ireland.  When the alcohol limit was being lowered in 2010, many of the same arguments were put.<br\/><br\/>The fundamental mistake of those critics who say that this Bill will damage rural Ireland is that they are conflating two very different issues.  One is drink-driving, which is a public safety issue, and an issue on which I want to protect the public everywhere, in all areas, rural and urban.  The other and entirely separate issue is the problem of social isolation in rural Ireland.  These two issues are different and those who would treat them as one issue do a disservice to both.<br\/><br\/>We know that rural Ireland does not have the concentration of public transport that more densely populated areas do.  The Government fully appreciates that there is a particular problem as people get older in socialising in rural Ireland.  The Government has decided to explore ways of addressing social isolation in rural areas.  I invited a wide range of organisations, State, private and voluntary, to meet me in September to explore ways in which we can address the problem of social isolation in rural Ireland.  I am happy to say that there was a broad shared agreement on the problems and that a number of initiatives in this area are now being explored.  I have already invited the stakeholders to a second meeting this month.<br\/><br\/>I wish to bring to the attention of Deputies my intention to introduce on Committee Stage amendments to strengthen the law with regard to learner drivers who are driving unaccompanied by a qualified person.  There is strong support in the House for the strengthening of the law in this area and for the commencement of section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 2016, which for legal reasons I have been unable to commence.  I am confident that I will finally be in a position to commence this section with the amendments I am proposing and to introduce a law which is robust and enforceable.  I want to bring to an end the all-too-common practice of learner permit holders driving unaccompanied by a qualified person.<br\/><br\/>I shall also bring forward an amendment to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with unaccompanied learner drivers by amending section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, which allows the Garda to detain, store, release or dispose of vehicles in certain circumstances.  These include cases where the vehicle is untaxed or uninsured or where the driver has been disqualified.  I intend to propose adding to these cases circumstances where the driver is an unaccompanied learner.  This will be an effective tool in removing the immediate danger from the roads and will also be a strong deterrent to unaccompanied learner driving.<br\/><br\/>I urge the House to support the Bill and in so doing to make our law on drink-driving more robust and our roads safer.  It really is as straightforward as that.  I ask the House to listen to the voices of the road-safety experts and the road-safety advocates and victims groups who have all strongly supported this proposal.  Many of them are in the Gallery and I salute them.<br\/><br\/>Some may say that there are other matters which need addressing and, of course, there are.  Road safety is a goal we must and do pursue on a range of fronts and numerous initiatives are under way in line with the road safety strategy.  However, how can we address any issue properly if we make laws which do not apply serious consequences to seriously dangerous behaviour?<\/p><p>How can we expect drivers who would risk their own safety and that of others to be deterred if they know that the consequences would not be serious?  <\/p> <p> In the months leading up to the debate today members of road safety advocacy groups, people who have lost family members and friends in road collisions involving alcohol, have contacted many of the Members of this House to ask them to support this Bill.  They know, from sad experience, that every life matters, that there can be no acceptable level of collateral damage where drink-driving is concerned.  Their bravery in putting their own losses aside in order to work for the safety of others can only be hugely applauded.<\/p> <p> We talk of a need for culture change in regard to drink-driving, and rightly so.  We cannot expect a change if the law itself does not step up to the mark.  In an ideal world we would not have anyone acting so selfishly or so thoughtlessly as to drive after taking alcohol.  Unfortunately, we do not live in that kind of world.  There are people who would put themselves and others at risk.  We already make that behaviour illegal.  It is time the law made the consequences of that dangerous behaviour match the seriousness of the offence, and that is why I am asking all Deputies to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400037#KK01700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510686900,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening.  Before I begin my contribution, I, as my party's spokesperson for sport, would like to wish our national team the very best of luck in Lansdowne Road as it hopes to bring some goodwill and cheer to our country in its endeavours against Denmark.  I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of families who have been bereaved as a result of fatalities on our roads.  I salute their courageousness in the manner in which they have lobbied on this and on many other issues related to road safety, improving our legislation and reducing fatalities on our roads.  We are all are at one when we say we want to reduce the fatalities on our roads and reduce the number of people who have incurred serious injuries on our roads.  That is the reason I welcome the opportunity to debate this legislation.  It gives us an opportunity to improve our laws and to help reduce fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.  The increase in the number of road fatalities in recent years is worrying and it needs to be addressed.  In the period from 2015 to 2016 alone, we saw a 16% increase in the number of road fatalities.  We had become accustomed to a downward trajectory in the figures and an element of complacency may have set in.<\/p>  <p>  Some have sought to portray my party as somewhat soft on drink-driving and on road traffic offences but let me very clear, unambiguous and unequivocal, as a party, we totally condemn drink-driving.  We are the party that in 2001 introduced the penalty point system, in 2005 introduced mandatory alcohol testing on our roads, in 2006 set up the Road Safety Authority, in 2009 introduced safety cameras on our roads, in 2010 introduced a graduated driver licensing system for learner drivers and in 2011 lowered the blood alcohol limit to 50 mg, a point sometimes is lost in commentary.  It is currently illegal to drive a car with a blood alcohol limit in excess of 50 mg and in excess of 20 mg for specified drivers.  The reason it is illegal is that my party reduced that blood alcohol limit in 2010, which came into effect in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the Minister's bona fides and that he believes what he is proposing is the right measure and that it will reduce fatalities.  The figures from which we are working and with which we were presented at the committee at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage date back to 2008 and to 2012.  There is only one year in that period where the new measures introduced in 2010, namely, the imposition of a &euro;200 fine and three penalty points, came into effect.  In that same period over 50% of the fatalities on our roads were the result of drivers being found to be over four times the legal limit.  We have no way in this Bill to address that.  In that period a significant number of motorists were found to have had a blood alcohol level of over 80 mg.  We are not addressing that nor the issues concerning pedestrians or cyclists.<\/p>  <p>  When I sought up to date figures from the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, in March, July and most recently in a parliamentary question in September, they were unavailable.  The reason they are unavailable from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that unfortunately its members cannot stand over the figures they would produce today.  That is not right or proper.  It is certainly not right when we consider that more than 1 million fake breath tests are alleged to have been carried out.  What we are being asked to support is a Bill based on figures that predominantly predate the introduction of the reduced blood alcohol limit in 2011.  The up to date figures we have been given are preliminary and the other figures we have tried to get from the Minister when he appeared before the Oireachtas committee and by way of parliamentary questions are not available.<\/p>  <p>  What the Minister and my party differ on is not the fact it is illegal, because currently that is what is in law, but on the sanctions that apply to motorists found to have a blood alcohol level in excess of 50 mg.  The Minister tells us, and other people advocate, that an automatic disqualification from driving is one way to go, that this is the only way we can get impaired drivers off our roads.  The question I have asked the Minister repeatedly, which he has been unable to answer, is that if automatic disqualification is the only way to go, why in 2016, according to the figures he gave when he appeared before the Oireachtas committee, were 8,063 people arrested for driving while intoxicated.  Of that 8,063, 7% were found to be in the category of having a blood alcohol level of 50 mg to 80 mg, 93% were in the category of having a blood alcohol level where they would have been liable to automatic disqualification straight away.  If automatic disqualification was a deterrent, one would imagine those figures would be reversed.  The real deterrent to people not taking a chance in this regard is to ensure we have a significant Garda presence on our roads.  Unfortunately, this Government and the previous one have allowed a situation transpire where the number of garda&iacute; in the traffic corps have decreased by 40% since 2010.  Unfortunately, the only way we can get impaired drivers out from behind the wheel of the car is the chance of them being caught, that is, by a car with a blue flashing light coming up behind them or at a checkpoint.  That has not been happening.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the Garda initiated the Gillian Treacy campaign.<\/p><p>In the month leading up to Christmas, there was a 34% reduction in the number of deaths compared with the corresponding period in 2015 and a 27% reduction from the corresponding period in 2014.  If we had a greater Garda presence on our roads, I firmly believe we would get our impaired drivers off the road.  I must ask the Minister the question as to who is running An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at present.  It is a leaderless organisation.  The Commissioner has stepped down and the acting Commissioner has indicated he does not want to be the Commissioner.  In fact, he has already gone on a pre-retirement course.  Who is in charge and who will ensure a sufficient number of people are working in the traffic corps?<\/p> <p> I understand the Crowe Horwath report has been presented to the Cabinet and that it calls for a review of the road traffic legislation with a view to streamlining and simplifying it where possible.  The Garda Inspectorate also called for this in 2014, yet it has not been done.  I also understand the report states it should not be used in any future process in respect of performance or disciplinary matters.  Surely to God the Minister, as a member of Cabinet, will ensure that senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be held responsible for 1 million fake breath tests.  I hope he is.  This report also reveals that the five-shift system is going will be examined and that the hours of overtime will be cut by 33% in 2018.  If that happens, we will see a smaller Garda presence on our roads, not a greater one.  I believe that will lead to more fatalities.<\/p> <p> The Minister portrays this legislation cynically in suggesting it will make a huge difference.  He portrays Fianna F&aacute;il as being soft on the issue.  For this small category, we do not believe it is proportionate, in that somebody who has done the right thing and who took a taxi home the night before but who may be marginally over the limit the following morning, having done everything right, could potentially lose his or her driving licence for three months.  As a consequence of this, such people could lose their job, which would have a huge impact on their family.  I listened to the Minister last Thursday night on \"Prime Time\", when he was questioned about the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and the call for him to resign from his position.  The Minister said that what Deputy Halligan did was wrong and could not be condoned but that we must have proportionality in all aspects.  We believe we need proportionality in this regard.  I believe we need to send a strong message that this will not be tolerated and anybody caught in this category should be liable to a &euro;500 fine and five penalty points.  <\/p> <p> I will make a number of other comments on the Bill.  All Members will be afforded the opportunity to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage that will improve road safety.  The Road Safety Authority has conducted an in-depth study on the role of alcohol in fatal road deaths.  In eight out of ten cases, the blood alcohol level was over 100 mg.  Nowhere in this legislation are we tackling that.  In five out of ten cases, the blood alcohol content was over 200 mg.  Nowhere in this legislation are we tackling that issue.  I will table amendments on Committee Stage to ensure Irish law is brought into line with penalties that are in force across the Border in Northern Ireland and across the water in the UK.  At present, it can take six months to notify the District Court of an offence.  That is simply too long and should be reduced to a maximum of four weeks.  People who are found guilty of breaking the law should be taken off the road immediately.  That is an amendment that we will be proposing.<\/p> <p> I mentioned the need for greater enforcement.  In his contribution today, the Minister did not allude to the fact that a great number of people were involved in fatalities when they should have been off the road in the first instance.  Why is the situation allowed to pertain whereby disqualified drivers continue to drive a car?  We do not have sufficient penalties in place.  I am told that even though disqualified drivers are obliged to return their licences to the Road Safety Authority, 98% of them do not do so.  That is a disgrace and it is no wonder we have so many disqualified drivers on the road.  How can that be allowed happen in this day and age?  People in that category should also see their penalty increased.<\/p> <p> The Minister was right to mention the worrying number of young people who are involved in fatal collisions and who feel it is okay to take the chance.  We are not doing enough at an early stage to ensure that young people are educated on the dangers of drink-driving.  While it is an optional module in transition year, we should engage with the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure that it is not optional but is a mandatory module to prepare children for when they take up driving at 17 or 18.<\/p> <p> This is an opportunity to tackle the scourge that is cyclists and the significant number of cyclists involved in fatalities this year.  I intend to table an amendment that will ensure there is a minimum required passing distance for cars overtaking cyclists.  I hope the Minister will support it.  It should be mandatory for all cyclists to wear a helmet at all times.  I have already discussed with the Minister the need for pedestrians to wear high-visibility jackets on unlit roads.  That is another amendment which I will bring forward on Committee Stage.  The Minister shares my concern and supported me when I raised the matter previously.  This is an opportunity to address the issue.<\/p> <p> As we indicated last year, Fianna F&aacute;il will support the amendment in respect of unaccompanied learner drivers.  We indicated that we would do so 12 months ago.<\/p><p>It has taken 12 months for the Bill to come to where it is but we will support it.  Originally, the Minister anticipated the legislation would be brought before the Oireachtas in March or April 2017, it would be stand-alone and would be enacted without delay.  I do not know for what reason the Minister was not able to bring it before the D&aacute;il at that time.  However, the intervening period has enabled our party to look at sensible amendments which can only enhance and improve road safety, as well as helping reduce collisions, fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.<\/p> <p> As much as we can on this side of the House, we will support the Minister bringing this Bill to the next Stage.  The only area on which we disagree is the proportionality of the offence.  We will bring forward an amendment to ensure we signify it is wrong to commit an offence with a blood-alcohol concentration of over 50 mg per 100 ml.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400039#MM00200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510688100,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017.  My colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and I will support it.  The Bill is designed to change the penalty for those found to be driving with a blood alcohol level above 50 mg and below 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  This is already an offence and the penalty is a fine along with three penalty points.  The Bill does not propose to change the legal limits for drinking and driving.  Only the penalty will change.  We support the Bill because it sends a message that drinking and driving is wrong, dangerous and unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  The State has a poor record of deaths on our roads.  We have come a long way in the past decade in this regard.  However, there has been a worrying trend in the past few years with the numbers of annual deaths due to road traffic accidents creeping up.  One life lost on our roads is one too many.  Sadly, over the past several years, the number of people dying on our roads has increased.  There are many reasons for this, including poor roads, careless drivers, drink and drug driving and, perhaps most importantly, the slashing of the Garda Traffic Corps.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, drinking and driving has become less acceptable.  We need to work towards a society where drinking and driving is universally condemned.  We are not there yet.  This was clear in recent months from the attitude of public representatives, most notably from Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and rural Deputies in other parties, including the Minister's Government colleagues.  This Bill is another step towards that aim.  Drinking and driving is reckless and dangerous, and should be recognised as such under the law.  A punishment of three penalty points does not relay that message.  A short suspension of a driving licence does.<\/p>  <p>  Some Members have been jumping up and down over this Bill, claiming they are concerned about protecting rural Ireland.  A Bill which seeks to impose harsher punishments on those caught drinking and driving is not an attack on rural life.  Indeed, those most at risk of being killed in a collision where alcohol is a factor are those living in rural areas.  I am sympathetic to those who live in rural and isolated regions of the State who do not have adequate access to transport links.  It is an absolute disgrace and I have raised it on several occasions with the Minister.  At the very least, 93,000 households do not have access to any public transport.  There are parts of the State which do not have trains, public buses, local links or even a regular hackney or taxi service.<\/p>  <p>  These problems do not mean we should fill in the gaps with drink drivers.  It is worth repeating that the matter at hand, namely, being found with between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml of blood is already an offence.  Essentially, my colleagues are calling for the current situation where it would appear drink-driving in some areas is considered to be acceptable.  It is never acceptable.  If the current laws give the message that this is a reasonable situation, then we need to change them.  The current penalty of three penalty points and a fine is apparently not getting the message across.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny at the transport committee.  That process was hijacked by some committee members, as well as non-committee members who oppose the legislation, in their attempt to discredit the evidence presented by the Road Safety Authority.  Those on both sides of the argument appeared before the committee.  The only interest groups who gave evidence against the legislation were vintners' groups.  Their reason for having an interest in this is obvious.  To my colleagues who claim they oppose these matters because of rural decline, if the best method they can come up with to address that issue is to argue that rural people should receive a softer punishment for drink-driving, then to be quite frank, I despair.  We can do much better than that.  The only reason I can think for Fianna F&aacute;il's and others' opposition to this Bill is that it is politically popular to do so.  We know Fianna F&aacute;il will take whatever position is politically popular at the time and its position changes as soon as public opinion does.<\/p>  <p>  It is quite disturbing that elected representatives care more about the votes of their constituents than they do about their lives or safety.  We need to take a wider view of this.  Politicians need to show leadership and do the right thing.  There are many other measures which we can introduce to help people in rural areas.  For years my party has called for an increase in spending on road maintenance in rural areas and expansion of the rural transport programme.  The Bill is the only measure which the Minister has proposed, which is disappointing but not surprising.  He needs to take an interest in rural Ireland, improving transport links and infrastructure.  To date, he has shown no interest at all.  Rural people are entitled to be able to travel safely and efficiently.  These measures will not solve any of the problems faced by those who do not have access to adequate services.  It may help to reduce drinking and driving, however.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister might be smiling but the fact is that 93,000 of rural households do not have access to any form of public transport whatsoever.  Bills like these are not the most pressing issue facing the Minister.  A more cynical person might even consider this to be a diversionary tactic.  The Minister has busied himself with this matter, along with judicial appointments, since he took office.  We all can agree there are bigger issues facing the Minister.  If he is concerned about road safety, his first port of call should be to invest in infrastructure.  Our roads have been underfunded for the past decade.  This means that essential maintenance and repairs have not happened.  At the Committee of Public Accounts some weeks ago, Transport Infrastructure Ireland stated the deficit was approximately &euro;100 million.  If our roads are not safe, then the people using them are not.  Investing in our roads would be beneficial to those living in rural areas and would make our roads safer for everybody.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will take this matter seriously.  When he first took office, he was told &euro;3 billion was required to bring our roads to a steady-state condition.  I have yet to see any significant movement on that.  Over the past decade, personnel numbers in the Garda traffic corps have been halved.<\/p><p>The Minister announced that additional personnel would be added to the corps but the increase was pushed back to the end of this year.  Can the Minister indicate the number of new garda&iacute; have joined the corps in 2017?  Has the 10% target been reached?  Earlier in the year, he gave a commitment at a meeting of the transport committee that there would be a 10% increase in the number of garda&iacute; in the corps.  He pressed the issue in the latter part of the year.  It is now November and Christmas is almost here.  The usual road safety campaign will be rolled out for the Christmas period and things will go back to normal on 2 January.  We do not only want optics this year.  Can the Minister confirm whether he has yet allocated the 10% increase in the number of officers serving with the Garda Traffic Corps to which he committed?<\/p> <p> In June of, there were 663 members of the corps.  In 2007, there were 1,200.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, need to address that as a matter of urgency.  All Members know how effective Christmas road safety plans are.  They are successful because personnel and resources are deployed in respect of road safety for a period of weeks, with checkpoints, safety messages and advertisements to beat the band.  If people know there is a good chance of coming across a Garda checkpoint, it is an effective deterrent to drink-driving and, therefore, an injection of resources into the traffic corps would ensure roads are safer for everybody.  That makes common sense.  I raised with the Minister on several occasions that there are places in County Louth and across the State in which many people make a deliberate choice to drink and drive in the full knowledge and comfort that there is no chance of their meeting a checkpoint on the road.  They go from home to the pub and from the pub to home without ever coming across a Garda checkpoint and, therefore, there is no deterrent.  I appeal to the Minister, if he is serious about the issue, to roll out measures not just for three weeks over Christmas but to have them sustained throughout the year because the Bill alone is not sufficient.<\/p> <p> We still do not know the full truth of how the Garda breath test scandal came about or who was responsible.  There has been no accountability whatsoever.  Formulating legislation of this nature in a climate of what appears to be complete dysfunctionality is not ideal.  To properly formulate legislation, we need access to correct information and data.  At no stage have I heard the Minister put the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, under any pressure in a public arena to produce the data or, more importantly, to press for accountability and to hold those responsible for the scandal to account.  It also appears that those who drafted the Bill did not have the data to hand.<\/p> <p> Introducing harsher penalties at a time when there are very serious questions to be answered by the Garda in respect of breath tests is not ideal.  However, despite the Minister's many failures, I accept that this does not fall under his remit but, rather, that of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I support the Bill and hope the Minister will take my comments on board when he considers future steps regarding road safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400041#OO00200","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510688700,"counter":422,"content":"<p>The Labour Party will support the legislation as it passes through the Houses.  This is a short Bill that has been the subject of long debate in recent months.  That is understandable because drink-driving elicits strong and passionate responses from people across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party supports the Bill.  I say that plainly because it is important that there be no ambiguity about the matter.  There can be no condoning or making excuses for drink-driving or impaired driving due to alcohol intake.  However, our support should not be taken as a signal that we believe the legislation is the silver bullet it has been presented as by the Minister.  There is considerable scepticism as to whether legislation such as this is likely to have a significant impact, in particular if it is regarded as a stand-alone solution that will end drink-driving on our roads.  The Minister should listen to such scepticism rather than painting as a defender of drink-driving anyone who dares to question his logic.<\/p>  <p>  Drink-driving is not the only cause of dangerous driving.  Speeding is a major problem, as is using a mobile phone or tablet device while driving.  Driving a car that is not roadworthy is an almost overlooked cause of accidents and poorly maintained roads contribute significantly to the problem.  Those are all major issues that need to be further tackled in order to make our roads safer and to minimise the carnage thereon.<\/p>  <p>  The scepticism to which I referred exists because many Members do not believe there is sufficiently robust existing enforcement of road traffic legislation.  Members know statistics produced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the matter cannot be trusted, which further feeds such scepticism.  The Labour Party believes there should be more enforcement of existing legislation but we need to be able to trust the enforcement, the statistics and the Garda.  The breath test scandal has ruptured the trust in Garda traffic enforcement.  It reinforced the view that the Garda is after figures and targets rather than apprehending those who are breaking the law and driving over the blood alcohol limit.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest bugbears for many is the placing of speed vans in areas with low speed limits, such as 50 km\/h zones, to try to catch people driving at perhaps 52 km\/h, 53 km\/h or 54 km\/h.  I know of places in Balbriggan and Balrothery in north county Dublin, to name only two areas, where such speed vans are regularly located.  Those locations are not speeding or accident black spots and local people know that.  It seems the locations are strategically chosen to catch people driving at slightly over a very low speed limit.  Local people believe the speed vans are placed there to raise revenues and meet penalty point targets.  When we hear about scandals such as the breath tests, such negative views are reaffirmed in the public mind.  Trust is broken and the ability to enforce existing legislation, let alone new traffic measures, becomes even more difficult.<\/p>  <p>  Many people have an increasing lack of trust in the Minister and the Government.  There is great scepticism that the vague commitments the Minister gave to Fine Gael regarding the enhancement of rural transport will be acted upon.  Improving rural transport is vital in order to sustain all elements of rural life, including the ability for rural people to socialise in their local town and perhaps enjoy a couple of drinks in their local pub.  There are real problems of social isolation in rural communities.  These are real problems, not imagined or exaggerated ones.  Large parts of my constituency of Dublin North are rural and in them I see the effects of rural isolation.  Many who live in rural isolation have few social outlets and no transport available to them other than their cars.  As a nation, we do not do enough to connect people with their communities.  There are pockets of Roscommon and Leitrim where communities have organised themselves to provide transport options for those living in isolation.  Rural transport initiatives to bring people to a pub or community centre for an occasional night out or older people to do their shopping could meaningfully strengthen our communities.  The Minister should reflect on the role his Department might play in achieving that goal.  The State could do much more, we should do more and it is vital that the Minister does much more.  We want the Minister to articulate more details of those plans before the Bill passes Final Stage and provide greater clarity.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken to the families of people who have lost their lives as a result of drink-driving and many of them are in the Gallery this evening.  Their pain is evident and their desire to reduce the number of such deaths on our roads is entirely understandable.  That desire is genuinely felt by all Members.  My party and I have been convinced by speaking to the families and hearing from the Road Safety Authority that this legislation may help to save some lives.<\/p><p>It will change the existing link between being over the limit and receiving penalty points to a link between being over the limit and disqualification from driving.  This has the potential to further alter people's behaviour, which, it is to be hoped, will save lives.  As I said previously, the legislation is not a silver bullet.  Those reckless individuals who drink to excess and get behind the wheel of a car, leading to tragic consequences and carnage, will probably not be dissuaded from their criminal actions by the Bill.  They are not dissuaded by the existing sanctions of disqualification attached to blood alcohol levels greater than 80 mg.  However, any measure which might prevent even one death on our roads is a measure we support and, accordingly, we will vote in favour of the legislation.  However, we do not accept that this legislation alone will fix the problem the Minister is determined to fix.  I appeal to him to resist the urge to continue belittling anyone who questions his approach and instead to try to work in a more meaningful, cross-party manner to try to tackle some of the most challenging social issues we face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400042#PP00200","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510689300,"counter":424,"content":"<p>Iam delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 and to support it strongly.  However, on reading the Bill, it is a little like a jigsaw, amending different sections and subsections of the many Road Traffic Acts, with deletions and substitutions also provided for.  The Bill therefore reinforces the urgent need for a consolidation project for all Road Traffic Acts back to 1961.  The number of Acts and the complexity of legislating in this area have led to so many loopholes and lacunae over the years, which weaken what should, in practice, be very strong road safety legislation.  It is unfortunately typical of this piecemeal Government that whereas Deputy Paschal Donohoe committed to consolidation of road traffic law when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport a few years ago, the current Minister told me at the beginning of October:<\/p><blockquote>The consolidation of existing road traffic legislation is a significant project, requiring the allocation of resources specifically to deal with such a project over an estimated two to three year period.  In light of the fact that my officials are currently working on a number of Bills, most of which are primarily focused on road safety, it is not possible to commence such a consolidation project at this time.<\/blockquote><p>However, just last week I asked the same question of the Taoiseach, who was the predecessor of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the very same Department, and he said:<\/p><blockquote>[Consolidation] is, it is fair to say, a longstanding project in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I am not sure how much progress has been made on the legislation as yet ... A consolidated Bill would be a very good step forward.<\/blockquote><p>The Taoiseach went on to refer to the fact we have consolidated company law and taxation law over the years to very good effect.  The question for the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is, where exactly does he stand on consolidation?  Is he committed to it, or has it again been put on the long finger?  During debate on the Road Traffic Bill 2016 last December, the Minister, Deputy Ross, told me:<\/p><blockquote>My Department is working on consolidation, as has always been the case.  I understand it is being worked on quite aggressively at the moment.<\/blockquote><p>I would like the Minister, Deputy Ross, perhaps in his reply, to indicate whether or not there is a consolidation project.  Since 1961 there have been something like 16 or 18 Road Traffic Bills and a whole plethora of other Bills which also affect the courts system and transport generally.<\/p><p>However, after that initial caveat, I commend the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, for bringing forward this important legislation and for his determination in the past 18 months on different matters to improve road safety for road users.  I am delighted to support the Bill.  The Minister has certainly faced much opposition to the Bill from lobby groups such as the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and some rural Deputies, and I note the weasel words from Fianna F&aacute;il again tonight.  Rural Deputies wrongly state that the Bill is anti-rural.  In fact, as the Minister already said, 81% of alcohol-related road deaths occur in rural Ireland and, therefore, the Bill will undoubtedly save rural lives.<\/p><p>The legal blood alcohol content, BAC, limit is 50 mg for most drivers and 20 mg for certain drivers, namely, learners, novices and professional drivers.  However, due to an anomaly inserted into legislation by Fianna F&aacute;il, drivers over the 50 mg limit but under 80 mg receive just three penalty points and a &euro;200 fine, whereas drivers with blood alcohol levels between 80 mg and 100 mg are disqualified from driving for six months and fined &euro;400.  The Bill addresses this anomaly.  The disqualification penalty has been shown in the past to be a very powerful deterrent.  This is the reason the Bill is fundamentally worth supporting.  The Bill amends the relevant subsections of section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, removing reference to penalty points and substituting references to disqualification.<\/p><p>As I mentioned, the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in April and May showed the strength of the alcohol lobby, with many Deputies disregarding the huge numbers of lives lost and the families tragically affected by drink-driving.  As the Minister knows, I have worked very closely over the years with Ms Susan Gray and her colleagues in the excellent civil society group Promoting Awareness, Responsibility and Care on our Roads, PARC.  I warmly welcome some of our guests to the Gallery, including Susan and other members of PARC and the Clancy family and others whose lives have been tragically affected by loss of lives on our roads.  I pay tribute to the heroic work of Susan Gray, Ann Fogarty, Noel, Fiona and Declan Clancy, James Regan Snr. and James Regan Jnr., Louise Doyle, Marie McElhinney, Jo Petford and the many other campaigners for saving lives on Irish roads over the years.  Susan lost her husband, Stephen, very tragically a number of years ago on St. Stephen's Day.  The unaccompanied learner driver in that crash had been drinking that evening.<\/p><p>The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has compiled data on alcohol's involvement in fatal crashes which show that between 2008 and 2012 alcohol was a contributing factor, as the Minister said, in 38% of fatal crashes.  In her appearance before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on 17 May to refute disingenuous claims by the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, RSA chief executive Ms Moyagh Murdock stated, &quot;A total of 25 drivers and motorcyclists with a confirmed BAC between 21 mg and 80 mg were responsible [...] for killing themselves [tragically] and-or others because they consumed alcohol.&quot;  Based on statistics available from the RSA, the Minister has estimated that at least 35 people could possibly be saved on our roads over a period of five years.  Those 35 precious lives are well worth saving, and this is one reason we should bring this legislation forward.  However, we know for a fact that the figure quoted by the Minister is an under-representation of the extent of the problem because for three and a half of these five years there was no compulsory testing of surviving drivers in fatal crashes.  We also do not have the figures for those with serious injuries due to road traffic collisions where alcohol is a factor because of the dearth of accurate information in this area.<\/p><p>Since the Road Traffic Bill 2011 there is supposed to be mandatory alcohol testing at the scene of all road traffic collisions, RTCs, where someone has died or been injured.  Early questioning by me on the matter in 2012 showed that more than half of the drivers involved in RTCs were not being tested despite this legislation having been passed.  In January 2015 the T&aacute;naiste replied to a follow-up question on this, saying that up to 19 November 2014 there had been 161 fatal RTCs and that just 97 drivers, or 60%, were tested at the scene, six of whom tested positive for being above the legal limit.  I then asked why the other 64 drivers were not tested and at the end of May 2015 I received an answer.  At that point the information available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was that of the 181 fatal collisions in 2014, 82 drivers involved could not be tested &quot;due to fatal injury&quot; and a table indicated reasons for a further 51 drivers.  However, 51 plus 82 equals only 133, and an explanation was never given for the remaining 48 drivers.  Many other reasons were given for not testing drivers at the scene, but these figures do not seem acceptable.  I submitted questions on this matter again recently and again received &quot;holding&quot; replies.<\/p><p>Section 3 of the Bill relates to the transitional provision for the period prior to commencement of section 1 of the Bill.  Disqualification from driving for the offence of driving with a BAC of between 50 mg and 80 mg will only apply after the commencement of section 1, so I hope the Minister will this time indicate that we will have an early commencement of this section.<\/p><p>We have experience of the Road Traffic Act 2016 where a number of sections were not commenced despite the fact this House took on board amendments from Opposition parties and Independents.  The Minister has effectively ignored them and refused to commence sections.  The Minister said in a reply to a parliamentary question earlier in October that he would add an amendment to address the need for section 41 of the 1994 Act to give powers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seize the vehicles of unaccompanied learner drivers.  Last week saw much discussion in the media about vehicles owners being responsible for unaccompanied learner drivers.  Will the Minister indicate whether there are one or two Government amendments being brought forward relating to unaccompanied learner drivers on Committee Stage?  They relate to the power for the garda&iacute; to seize cars and making vehicle owners responsible.  Both provisions are to improve road safety which the Minister promised this time last year to Mr. Noel Clancy and his family.  The D&aacute;il passed a section of the Road Traffic Act 2016 to this effect.  Unfortunately, the action by the Minister then turned out to be an empty promise.  We want to know for definite this time when the commencement orders will be signed for the various sections.<\/p> <p> I welcome the provisions in section 2 which amend the Road Traffic Act 2002 to provide for the pausing of penalty point timing during a period of disqualification.  Therefore, penalty points and reaching the threshold for penalty points will run consecutively rather than concurrently with any period of disqualification, as in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p> As always, the library and research service produced a very useful and informative Bill digest.  It discusses the Bill and includes an interesting section on what works to combat drink driving.  I note the RSA talks about the three Es, education, engineering and enforcement.  We know that greater enforcement of road safety legislation is key.  More mandatory intoxicant tests, MITs, and visibility of garda&iacute; on the roads are the most important aspects of increasing road safety and reducing deaths and serious injuries.  There are also some technical and practical things that the relevant industries, the motor insurance industry, for example, could be involved in championing.  The ignition interlock is an area that is of interest.  It is a device linked to the vehicle which would prevent the vehicle from starting if any alcohol was detected in the driver&rsquo;s breath.  Queensland state in Australia, for example, uses these locks for drivers who have already been convicted of drink-driving and interlocks are also used in some European countries.  Drink-driving is an international issue and organisations, including the World Health Organization, WHO, have published reports and strategies on how to reduce drink-driving.  Disqualification for driving over the limit is one of the WHO&rsquo;s recommendations, as is lowering the blood alcohol content, BAC, limits.  It is in line with the legislation before us.  The 2010 North review in the UK stated that \"the threat of a substantial period of mandatory disqualification has proved to be a potent weapon in combatting drink driving.&rdquo;  I believe that vehicle manufacturers and EU vehicle standards, in other words, the whole car industry, need to focus on driver safety most of all.  For example, why do many saloons not have a rear window wiper and why is speed limit warning technology which one finds in many new vehicles, such as the Toyota Avensis, not mandatory for all vehicles?<\/p> <p> In Ireland, 615 drivers were arrested in January for driving while intoxicated, 672 in February, 711 in March, 903 in April, 801 in May, 750 in June, 723 in July and 776 in August.  This represents an increase of 14% on the same period last year.  It would be interesting to see how many of these, depending on the BAC levels, have taken their penalty points and paid their fixed charge notices to avoid a court appearance and how many have decided to challenge the matter in court.  We know that because of a mistake by the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, while he was the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, large numbers of drink-driving cases have been thrown out of court due to the loophole around the breathalyser reports being printed in only Irish or English.  That was SI 541.  The Minister at the time and the Department seemed to misinterpret the rule about two copies being given after a breath test, one for the driver and one for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We await the opinion of the Supreme Court on this.  The previous Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, closed the loophole arising from Deputy Varadkar's mistake in 2015.<\/p> <p> In January this year, the RSA conducted a national survey on attitudes to drink-driving and, as the Minister of State said, found that 91% of people surveyed supported automatic disqualification for those driving over the limit.  As the Minister of State said, this equates to 93% in favour from rural Ireland and 89% from urban areas.  I do not buy the argument that the Bill is anti-rural.  The figures I have mentioned here today show that, statistically, more rural lives will be saved given that alcohol is a factor in such a high percentage of road traffic crashes, RTCs, around the country.  Saying that rural pubs will suffer is a totally unacceptable argument against this Bill.  Using social isolation as a reason for rejecting the Bill disrespects the thousands of friends and families who have lost loved ones or suffered serious injuries in road traffic crashes due to alcohol over the years on Irish roads.<\/p> <p> As a transport spokesperson in the past for the Labour Party, I was always a strong supporter of local and community public transport companies.  I remember an impressive local transport company, OK Transport, a brilliant public service for Offaly and west Kildare, and other similar bodies from Kerry, Cork and various parts of Ireland, presenting to the committee which covered transport.  Local taxi and hackney services should also be encouraged and measures should be brought forward to support them.  I note the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, responded sympathetically to Deputy Heydon's proposal that we should support local rural transport providers.  Like my Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, I would like to see evidence of that as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> Besides the number of tragic deaths and the horrendous suffering of families following deaths of family members, there is a simple and powerful argument against drink-driving.  A motor vehicle is a complex machine where the driver's absolute and full attention is always necessary when the vehicle is in use.  No employer would permit an employee to operate machinery if he or she was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  Why should the operation of a vehicle be any different?<\/p> <p> Already this year, as of yesterday lunchtime, we have lost 130 people on our roads and while this is 33 fewer than last year, it is still far too many.  We are not giving enough attention to serious injuries caused on our roads.  I was invited recently to a very informative briefing by Dr. Jack Short from Trinity College, Dublin on a paper he published in October 2017, Traffic injuries in Ireland: a neglected problem, for the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society and he has found a very serious problem with the reporting and recording of serious injuries caused by road traffic crashes.  His initial conclusions seem to be that serious crash injuries may be underestimated by a factor of three.  He gives interesting statistical evidence from what he has been able to gather from the health system and justice system that this is indeed the case.  I believe the Department is currently examining Dr. Short's paper and I would certainly encourage it to do so.<\/p> <p> We know that conviction rates for drink-driving remain low and even if the court figures are believed, the number of those who have lost their licence on conviction is shockingly low and worse still are the recorded figures of those who have been disqualified from driving returning their licences to the RSA post office box address in Cork.<\/p> <p> On 29 May 2017, I visited the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, on the invitation of Professor Denis Cusack, its director.  It was a very informative and useful visit.  It would be very useful for all Deputies to visit it.  Professor Cusack, his colleagues and the chief analyst showed us breath-testing and drug-testing devices.  We were informed that the tender for the new breath-test Draeger devices had gone out two weeks previously and was due back before the end of June.  Professor Cusack said that these would then be selected and tested for months before being sent out for use.  Professor Cusack also stated that he would expect the new devices to be available to garda&iacute; in early 2018.  The new breath-test devices will have a chip to record the location, time and number of each test.  That visit and the information we received is positive and will hopefully return the breath-test mechanism, process and legal measures that flow from it to being a process that will become accountable, given revelations that breath-test figures may have been inflated by more than 2 million.<\/p><p>The road safety group, Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care, PARC, has done extensive research and analysis of figures supplied by the Minister for Justice and Equality following parliamentary questions I raised on drink driving.  As the Minister of State is aware, PARC has attended court cases around the State to monitor the outcomes of road traffic offences and in particular those relating to drink driving and disqualified drivers.  PARC also regularly completes analyses of parliamentary questions data from the Department of Justice and Equality.  From PARC&rsquo;s analysis of drink-driving court cases during 2015 and 2016, an average of 20% of those convicted in court had their licence numbers recorded.  This figure reduced to 7% in Kerry and 8% in Limerick.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, is in charge of driver licences since 2013 yet, on its own admission to RT&Eacute; this year, 98% of persons who are disqualified are not surrendering their licences to the RSA.  It appears there are huge gaps in the information and the administration of road traffic law that we need to address urgently.<\/p> <p> I warmly welcome the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 and urge all my D&aacute;il colleagues to support it.  Hopefully, it will be a major step to end drink driving and to save many lives annually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400043#QQ00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510690500,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Bogfaimid ar aghaidh anois go dt&iacute; na Rural Independents.

I commiserate with anyone who has lost a loved one in any road tragedy.  I have seen quite a lot of it down through the years through my work.  I see the devastating effects it has on the family and the community.<\/p>  <p>  I must be honest and say that I have a conflict of interest when talking about this Bill because I have two brothers who work in the pub business in rural Ireland.  My brother John has Chaplin's Bar in Bandon and my brother Danny has the Boston Bar in Bantry.  My daughter works in two pubs, the Long Boat Bar in Durrus and Arundel's in Ahakista.  There are some 25 jobs in those establishments.  It is important to think of that.  These are rural jobs, part-time and full-time.  Every publican I know acts very responsibly and tries to care for his or her customers.  If publicans do not care for the customer there is a long-term implication.<\/p>  <p>  Where is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, going with this Bill?  It is a very anti-rural Bill as far as I can see.  I remember a number of years ago when the Minister for Finance at the time came to the House with his budget and said he was giving an increase in children's allowance for the first two children but not the third child.  There was an outcry.  People asked what the Minister had against the third child.  I want to ask the Minister, Deputy Ross, what has he against the people of rural Ireland.  He certainly has a set on the people of rural Ireland with this Bill, and with a number of other issues I could mention.  This matter, however, is the one we are speaking on today.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is responsible for roads.  There are many other factors resulting in people being killed on our roadsides.  I do not agree with excessive drinking.  I do not really drink much myself and if publicans had to depend on me, they would be pitied.  There is, however, no talk about the Minister bringing in a Bill to shut the bar in Leinster House.  In my view, it should be shut because we should not have a place of drink in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I will not drink alcohol in here.  It should not be here.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, should start leading by example.  He should start by not bringing this Bill that will, obviously, damage rural Ireland.  A Deputy across the floor of the House said earlier that rural Deputies were jumping up and down.  Shame on any Deputy who would say that we would not stand up for our people.  Shame on someone telling Deputies and the nation that it is the vintners who are against this measure.  Of course, the vintners have peoples' livelihood's to protect; their own and their staff.  They have young people who are depending on the job and the community depends on their service.<\/p>  <p>  There are many other issues the Minister, Deputy Ross, is forgetting, which are the cause of loss of life in the State.  I can name one of them.  Why has the Minister not issued a report, or instructed the local authority to carry out a survey, on every roadside tree in the State that has caused a roadside death and which will continue to kill people?  Two years ago, when I was a local authority member, I pushed as hard as I could to make sure that our local authority would do a report on trees that were falling over the roadside.  We are lucky to have a great company in the ESB because the cables and the poles are holding up most of the roadside trees in west Cork.  The Minister, however, will not worry about this issue.  Do not worry about the loss of life if a tree falls on a person.  These are the matters he should be looking at instead of picking on this issue, but this issue is popular.  It is a highly emotional topic for many people.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the lack of funding for roads in my constituency.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is in charge of roads.  That lack of funding is a cause of deaths on our roads.  There is no funding whatsoever for roads such as the N71, the R581 or the R582.  I get details of little bits of funding, such as &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000.  This is nothing as such.  The Minister of State should try to travel the road from my parish of Goleen to Cork city some time.  I can tell him it would be the rockiest spin he would ever have.  There is no funding for our roads and the roads are in severe danger of causing loss of life.<\/p>  <p>  The Government talks of rural-proofing Government policy, but that is the biggest cod that was ever mentioned in this D&aacute;il.  It is a mockery to the people of rural Ireland.  I raised the issue last week in regard to the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, about rural-proofing.  He said that he was speaking to people about it.  However, people are being told what the Government is going to do.  That is not rural-proofing.  This is the same.  If the Minister, Deputy Ross, wants to go ahead with a measure such as this what has he put in place to help the people of rural Ireland come and go within their community?  He has put in place nothing.  He will talk to them again.  The Minister speaks of social isolation but I am afraid he does not have a clue what it means.  Before this Bill ever reached the D&aacute;il the Minister should have resolved that issue but he did not.  He is failing in his duty to the people of Ireland.  Our Constitution does not say it looks after the people of urban Ireland, its states that it looks after the people of Ireland.  With this Bill the Minister, Deputy Ross, is failing in his duty to do that.<\/p>  <p>  There are many issues causing upset, annoyance and frustration in this regard.  The Minister was in west Cork during the summer and he will not deny the number of people he met to discuss roads and tourism issues.  I accept he has a big brief.  Every group he met, however, told him not to go ahead with this Bill.  They were not all publicans and brewery people, they were people from rural Ireland who understood what rural Ireland means.  The Minister listened to them but still he went ahead with this.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that applies in this respect is driver licences.  There is frustration among young people on this matter.  There is a complete lack of public transport where I live.  The bus leaves at 7 a.m. and comes back at 8 p.m.  Is that the way to treat people?  Is this the way to bring forward Bills that cause further isolation, further mental health issues and further difficulties?  The way the Minister, Deputy Ross, has gone about it is certainly wrong.  One needs to look at the rural-proofing and resolve the issues before bringing forward another measure that might have catastrophic consequences for quite a lot of people.  There are many people pleading for driver tests but there is a backlog for months.  This leads to more frustration.  There are many people who are returning to Ireland from all over the world.  I met a gentleman over the weekend who has brought considerable employment to Ireland and yet he cannot get an Irish driver licence.  Last week he could drive in Manhattan but he cannot drive in west Cork this week because he does not have an Irish driver licence.  This is another way of making life more difficult for a person in a rural community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400045#SS00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1510690500,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I must adjourn the debate as it is 8 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111400045#SS00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510690500,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"}]
