This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  The Garda Inspectorate, in its 2015 report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot;  has estimated that there may be up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.  With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment by the end of the year and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.<\/p><p>The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in Budget 2017 will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.  These appointments will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.<\/p><p>In addition, and again flowing from the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate, the Commissioner has commenced the roll-out on a pilot basis of a Divisional model of policing to replace the current District model.  The benefit of the Divisional model is that responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis which will facilitate greater flexibility in the deployment of resources in response to policing needs.

It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy.  In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society.  This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition.  The key point is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced.  Such a symbolic gesture - as the Traveller NGO paper argues - could have the potential to create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue. <\/p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014).  When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue.  The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way.  My officials and I are currently working to advance this issue with national Traveller organisations in this regard.

Government bond yields in general including for Ireland have risen in recent weeks and particularly so in recent days.  It remains to be seen whether this is a temporary re-pricing or the beginning of a more sustained rise in yields generally. <\/p>  <p>  While the recent increase in government bond yields has no immediate impact on our debt servicing costs, a sustained rise could negatively impact the cost of servicing the National Debt over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the sensitivity of the economy to changes in interest rates.  Indeed, the Risk and Sensitivity Analysis chapter in Ireland's Stability Programme April 2016 Update (SPU) included an illustrative assessment of the impact of a 1 percentage point (pp) increase in interest rates (SPU page 27).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that interest rates are influenced by a number of factors including inter alia inflationary expectations, exchange rate developments, saving patterns of firms and households and risk premia.  The precise impact of rising interest rates on economic growth will depend on which factors are driving the increase and whether the increase is likely to persist.<\/p>  <p>  The NTMA completed its final bond auction of 2016 on 3 November.  That auction received bids of 2.6 times the &euro;750m being auctioned, demonstrating that investor interest was very strong.  This represented Ireland's continuing growth and demonstrates confidence in Ireland among the global markets.  With the completion of that auction the NTMA has issued &euro;8.25 billion nominal from its stated target range of &euro;6   10 billion in the bond markets this year, at a weighted average yield of 0.82 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  The NTMA's debt issuances earlier in the year, a time when Irish Sovereign borrowing yields\u00a0were at close to record lows, have allowed it to lock in longer maturities at low interest rates, which is positive for debt servicing costs and will be important when interest rates return to normal.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that\u00a0Ireland's fundamental debt dynamics are improving and debt servicing costs are declining.

This relies on estimates of fundamental house prices to determine the extent of over\/undervaluation, something which is unobservable and problematic.\u00a0 The authors suggest that partly as a result of undervaluation over the years to 2010 to 2014, declines in tax revenue fell below estimated fundamental levels.

Marine litter is a key feature of national and international maritime environmental policy. It has been identified as an issue to be addressed under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. It is also specified as a harmful human activity under the OSPAR Treaty which addresses pollution and other human impacts on the North Eastern Atlantic Environment.<\/p>  <p>  The marine litter problem is largely caused by poor waste management on land and at sea. Marine litter can be found in every aspect of the marine environment, and ranges in size from large objects such as fishing nets or shipping containers to micro-litter particles (defined as particles being smaller than 1 millimetre in size) such as fibres from artificial fabrics or microbeads. The fact that litter can move across marine borders with wind and currents means that no one country can solve the problem on its own. It needs an international approach.   <\/p>  <p>  However, the extent of the marine litter problem and the level of harm it causes to the environment are not fully understood at this time. Nonetheless, we are taking measures in co-operation with the EU and with our OSPAR partners to address this issue on the basis of the precautionary principle (i.e. that we should treat it as potentially harmful and respond accordingly while we develop our understanding of the actual harm it causes).<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with this, we are undertaking research to quantify the problem, identify the main sources or marine litter, establish the harm caused, and develop techniques to prevent, reduce and monitor marine litter levels. We are also working to raise awareness of this issue. For example I am supporting An Taisce with funding to develop a world leading module on marine litter as part of their excellent Green Schools&rsquo; programme. If this pilot programme is successful, it will be rolled out, not only throughout Ireland, but will be used as a model internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Plastic is a particular problem for the marine environment. Due to its buoyancy, it can easily be washed down rivers, blown offshore or collected by the tide from the shore as well as being dumped or lost directly into the seas from ships and fishing boats. It does not biodegrade and remains in the environment for a very long time. It can breakdown into secondary micro-plastic particles through erosion and there is evidence that both large plastic items and microplastics are being ingested by marine organisms with undetermined consequences.  Microplastics are also entering the marine environment in other forms such as microbeads in products.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to microbeads specifically, it is estimated that they represent a small but significant portion of marine micro plastic pollution. It is hard to remove them from waste water which can flow via rivers and estuaries into the sea and once there, they are impossible to remove. There are many well established natural biodegradable and mineral alternatives and there is a widely held view that their societal value as a product is considerably less than their potential for environmental harm.  In general it is considered that plastic microbeads used in cosmetics and body care products, such as exfoliating creams and body washes, as well as in detergents and surface cleaning agents, should, ultimately, be banned from use. However, for maximum impact, this would be best achieved at an EU-wide level.

A county breakdown of these payments is provided in the tabular statement. <\/p><p>The number of rent supplement tenancies transferred directly to the new housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is almost 5,300; approximately 35% of the 14,960 tenancies currently in receipt of HAP.

However, my Department has received a response to your question from his Department which I hope will be helpful to the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by my colleague Mr Varadkar that the Department of Social Protection is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The average waiting time for new carer's allowance (CA) applications at the end of September was 14 weeks and 9 weeks for carer's benefit (CARB).  At the end of September, there were 4,146 CA and 484 CARB applications awaiting decision.  The volume of claims on hands are a consequence of continued strong claim intake and the delays in processing are frequently caused by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for CA by the end of September 2016 are 20% higher than in the same period in 2015 while applications for CARB are 24% higher.  This has impacted on the timely processing of applications.<\/p>  <p>  Reducing these waiting times is a priority for the Department and it is working hard to make this happen.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by the Department in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  Where additional staffing is deployed to a scheme, such as has happened for carer&rsquo;s allowance, there is a time-lag involved while those staff are trained and build up expertise.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has seen a significant reduction in CA processing from 22 weeks at the end of May to 14 weeks at the end of September and expects the processing times for both schemes to reduce further, as recently assigned staff get up to speed with the work involved in claim processing.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600083#WRR01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600083#WRR01300"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[35317\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600083#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current waiting time for a medical card application to be processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>As at week ending 11 November 2016, 99.67% of medical card applications received by the Primary Care Reimbursement Services were processed within a 15 day timeframe.<\/p><p>All applications or reviews concerning medical and GP visit cards must be supported with a range of documentation, as outlined on the application forms.

Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2016 and the Regulations made thereunder, the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis and certain cannabis-related compounds is currently unlawful except under licence. However, the scope for such licences to be issued is restricted to a limited number of specific circumstances. This is in line with the international controls on cannabis as prescribed under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961. It is open for an Irish registered doctor to apply for a licence for such preparations for an individual, named-patient under their care. Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis. The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor. It would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister for Health, to involve myself in this process. My understanding is that many doctors would be quite cautious about recommending a cannabis-based treatment for a patient, in the absence of the robust clinical evidence which underpins authorised medicines.<\/p>  <p>  Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In July 2014, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988, were amended to allow for a specific cannabis-based medicinal product to be used in Ireland. This derogation was facilitated based on evidence from scientific data submitted by a company to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of this specific medicine and its ability to provide a clear medical benefit for patients with multiple sclerosis. Subsequently the HPRA granted a marketing authorisation for Sativex Oromucosal Spray to be marketed in the State for the relief of symptoms of spasticity for people with multiple sclerosis where other conservative treatments have failed to provide adequate benefits.  To date, the HPRA has not received any applications for authorisation for any further cannabis-based products, but remains open to doing so.  <\/p>  <p>  I have committed to urgently reviewing policy on medicinal cannabis. I have asked the HPRA for advice on emerging research and international developments in the use of medicinal cannabis. I hope to receive a report from the HPRA early in the new year. I will then be in a position to consider and progress any legislative changes that may be recommended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600084#WRS00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultant Recruitment","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600084#WRS00925"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[35379\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600084#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the position for the sarcoma specialist at St. Vincent's Hospital has been advertised; if so, if the advertisement specifically mentioned a sarcoma specialist; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[35395\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600084#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 529 of 12 July 2016 the status of his commitment that the recruitment of a consultant medical oncologist with a special interest in sarcoma, based in St. Vincent's University Hospital, will be prioritised; the criteria stipulated in the job description to ensure that a specialist with extensive experience in treating this rare disease is being sought by his Department; if he is satisfied that the recruitment process commenced by the director general of the HSE will ensure that a specialist of world class standard will fill this position and that the highest possible standards will be met unequivocally in respect of treating patients with sarcoma; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

They recently held a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector, which I understand was very well received.  A Marketing Intensification Programme which aims to provide targeted marketing supports to companies with high dependency on UK markets has been rolled out.  Grant supports will be prioritised to assist companies in strengthening their position in that market, and in their efforts to identify new markets.<\/p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2017, I have\u00a0secured an additional &euro;700,000 in funding for capital investments in the commercial Horticulture sector which includes the Mushroom sector.

I have no role in the setting of prices of course. <\/p><p>After a prolonged period of price volatility in dairy markets , there are some tentative signs of recovery.  At present the Irish raw milk price is 6.2% above the EU average and there has been strong increase in butter prices across the EU bloc in recent weeks.<\/p><p>However, volatility will continue to be a feature of global  dairy markets.  Fixed price and margin contracts, futures markets and access to increasingly flexible forms of credits are all part of the toolkit that will be required.  There has been significant progress in each of these areas, with initiatives by processors and a new flexible loan fund for dairy and other farmers announced in Budget 2017. <\/p><p>On the market front, since taking office I have led trade missions to Asia and to North Africa, with a view to increasing the profile of Ireland as a producer of quality food products, including dairy products.  These markets are characterised by existing business relationships, but also high potential for further growth.  The development of trade in international dairy markets for Irish producers is key to ensuring sustainable growth for the sector and  is also a critically important  element in mitigating market volatility.  This work on market diversification is particularly important in the context of Brexit.<\/p><p>The Dairy Quality Assurance Scheme is also critically important in developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy products on EU and international markets.  Dairy processors make a substantial contribution to cover some of the costs of audits under the scheme, but of course the question of price incentives for participation is a matter for the industry. <\/p><p>On-going efforts within industry, supported by Government, to move dairy production up the value chain wherever possible are also critically important.  These efforts are supported by investment by my Department and its agencies in research and innovation.  By providing financial support for Teagasc, ICBF and Animal Health Ireland, and for knowledge transfer groups, we are investing in the provision of  advice and education to farmers, to facilitate technology adoption and improve profitability at farm level.  My Department is also providing support for investment at farm level through the TAMS scheme. <\/p><p>Where appropriate, we must continue to focus on appropriate national and EU measures that can play a role in supporting the sector.  It is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.  The Commission, in many instances based on suggestions from Ireland and other like minded Member States, has already deployed a range of market supports including intervention and Aids to Private Storage, and a financial package of &euro;500 million for liquidity assistance was agreed at the Agriculture council in September 2016, with Ireland topping up its allocation to provide a total assistance package of approaching &euro;27M to Irish farmers in late 2015 and early 2016. <\/p><p>The Commission also announced a further &euro;500m support package for EU farmers in July 2016.  The first &euro;150m was reserved for an EU-wide scheme compensating farmers who reduce their milk output over certain reference periods towards the end of 2016.  This was very well subscribed to in Ireland and, should the commitments for reduction be adhered to, will be worth over &euro;10M to Irish dairy farmers in 2017.<\/p><p>For the other element of the Commission package, &euro;350m is set aside for Member State initiatives with fixed allocations per MS.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation under this scheme is &euro;11m.  I have decided to provide an additional &euro;13 million national aid in that in order to optimise the effectiveness of this measure and to use it to support  the development of a &euro;150 million fund for low interest loans for farmers. <\/p><p>A further measure that has assisted in reducing the burden on farmers was the negotiation and agreement of advanced payments for the Basic Payment and the RDP schemes, allowing us to pay out 70% and 85% respectively from 16th October. <\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with the dairy sector, with EU colleagues and International counterparts to ensure the development and maintenance of a sustainable dairy sector in Cavan, Monaghan and elsewhere. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600086#WRU01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600086#WRU01500"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[35322\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600086#WRU01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the impact the election of President Elect, Donald Trump will have on the farming sector here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>It is unclear at this early stage following the US election what impact the\u00a0election result will have on the farming sector in Ireland.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial\u00a0investment by the telecommunications sector\u00a0and through\u00a0a State intervention in those\u00a0areas where commercial investment has\u00a0not\u00a0 been fully demonstrated.  The\u00a0\u00a0formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Cork.<\/p>  <p>  Based on information provided by commercial operators up to 68% of the townland of Fountainstown will be covered by commercial operators while the remaining 32% \u00a0of the townland will be part of the State Intervention.  Members of the public can view whether their premises in\u00a0 Cork are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p>  <p>  While I cannot compel any operator to provide services to a particular premises,\u00a0the NBP aims to ensure that all premises can access high speed broadband.  In this regard, my Department continues\u00a0to actively monitor the deployment plans in the BLUE area and direct feedback from consumers is important.  I would encourage customers in the townland of Fountainstown area who cannot access high speed broadband services to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.  My Department needs this information to keep track of progress in those areas so that high speed broadband solutions can be found in parallel with the State Intervention high speed broadband network roll-out.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises including 85,000 premises in Co Cork, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.<\/p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600087#WRV02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600087#WRV02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600087#WRV02300"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[35240\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600087#WRV02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when the sports capital grant application system will be open; the supports that will be put in place to assist clubs with their applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.

Therefore it is not yet possible to provide the specific breakdown of the 2017 funding across the Department, Offices and its Agencies.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that the &euro;555 million in capital funding next year is to cover the following Agencies, organisations and programmes.<\/p><p>-  Enterprise Ireland <\/p><p>-  IDA Ireland <\/p><p>-  Science Foundation Ireland <\/p><p>-  31 Local Enterprise Offices <\/p><p>-  The Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions <\/p><p>-  InterTrade Ireland <\/p><p>-  InterReg Programme <\/p><p>-  National Standards Authority of Ireland <\/p><p>-  The Credit Guarantee Scheme <\/p><p>-  Tyndall National Institute <\/p><p>-  Ireland's membership of various international research organisations which include: <\/p><p>-  the European Space Agency <\/p><p>-  ELIXIR <\/p><p>-  European Molecular Biology Conference <\/p><p>-  European Molecular Biology Laboratory <\/p><p>-  Eureka <\/p><p>-  COST &ndash; Co-operation in Science &amp;amp; Technology <\/p><p>-  CECAM &ndash; Centre Europ&eacute;en de Calcul Atomique et Mol&eacute;culaire.<\/p><p>The &euro;555 million in capital funding is directly supporting over 400,000 jobs across the clients supported by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices. It is also assisting Ireland&rsquo;s standing as a globally recognised research performing nation, ranked 14<sup>th<\/sup>in the world.<\/p><p>Much of this funding is multi-annual in nature and is demand driven.  To protect the Exchequer&rsquo;s investment the funding is also contingent on various terms and conditions being met by the grant recipient, be it a company, organisation or higher education institution.  In the context of the research and development funding, this is often subject to rigorous scientific peer review.  Across certain agency grant programmes there are competitive funding calls.<\/p><p>It is also important to appreciate the scale of the enterprise agency client base being supported through the Department's capital funding.  Combined the Department&rsquo;s capital supports will cover in excess of 10,000 individual companies, higher education institutions and scientists.  Accordingly it is not possible at this stage to provide a breakdown of the 2017 regional or sectoral funding that is being sought by the Deputy.  Such a level of detail can only be done once expenditure has actually been incurred, verified by the Agency concerned and paid out to the grant recipients.<\/p><p>It is important to also recognise that Brexit is an evolving situation.  As Chair of the Department&rsquo;s Brexit Co-Ordinating Committee, and since the UK Referendum result in late June, I have been working very closely with my officials and the Enterprise Agencies to ensure an effective and co-ordinated Brexit response on the wide range of enterprise, trade, innovation and regulatory matters of direct relevance to the Department&rsquo;s remit.<\/p><p>The additional &euro;3 million in Pay that I secured in Budget 2017 is specifically to assist in our response to the evolving Brexit situation.  It will enable the Department and its Agencies to recruit an additional forty to fifty staff.  The additional staff will be specifically tasked with assisting companies adjusting to the challenges faced from Brexit, help enterprise clients to diversify into new markets, secure new business and explore innovation opportunities.  I have established a specific Brexit Unit in the Department who, as well as assisting in the overall co-ordinated enterprise response, will also be directly involved in the extensive negotiations that will arise on foot of the UK's departure from the EU.  Such extensive negotiations over the coming years will involve bilateral interactions with our UK counterparts as well as participation in EU specific negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600089#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[35307\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016111600089#WRX01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to meet businesses along the Border region, particularly in counties Cavan and Monaghan, ahead of Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am continuing to focus on developments in the fallout from Brexit and am deeply engaged with Enterprise Ireland (EI) and IDA Ireland regarding the impacts being felt by client companies.
