The impact there will be on compensators and we will moving to the same arrangements that apply across Europe generally, which are that if the Department pays income support in respect of, for instance, an illness which is the subject of a compensation claim, those payments made by the public body will be subsequently reclaimed as part of the insurance compensation award.<\/p><p>  I do not fully understand the Deputy's references.

The legislation makes no such provision.  Will the Minister indicate on what basis changes are made to the household benefits package?  Is it an administrative issue because it is clearly not done on a statutory basis?  Can such changes be made at any time or only at budget time?<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 was ruled out on the basis that it was not relevant to the provisions of the Bill.  I have a solution to this problem.  The amendment would be relevant and germane to the provisions of the Bill if it was introduced by the Minister as a section in the Bill.  I invite her to make such provision, either on Committee Stage or Report Stage in the Seanad.  People are entitled to core and ancillary benefits and they can sometimes be as badly affected by reductions in ancillary benefits as cuts in core benefits.  For this reason, the House should have a facility to discuss both types of reductions on an equal basis. <\/p><p>  On amendments Nos. 4 and 5, the Bill extends PRSI to certain types of income for the first time.  If I understood the previous legislation correctly, PRSI will be applied to all incomes in excess of &euro;3,175, a very low level.  People can rent out a room of their dwelling under the rent a room scheme.  If one were to rent out a caravan or mobile home for only part of the year, the chances are one's income would exceed the new PRSI threshold of &euro;3,175.  The figure of &euro;6,000 I propose in amendment No. 4 is, therefore, more realistic. <\/p><p>  PRSI is being extended to income which did not attract it in the past.  However, those who will pay PRSI under this provision will not receive any benefits from the social insurance system.  This is wrong because the basis of the system is that one pays insurance and receives something in return.  Interest is already subject to income tax under the DIRT system.  This legislation, for the first time, extends PRSI to interest, which will become the only type of income on which PRSI will be applied without a corresponding benefit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500004#B00600","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382691900,"counter":30,"content":"<p>In the same vein, I tabled an amendment to ensure that any PRSI levied in the manner proposed would be reckonable for benefits.

I have suggested that D&aacute;il reform should allow Deputies to table amendments which may involve a charge on the Exchequer or people.  The current rules limit Deputies who identify a requirement to change legislation.  In this case, we are seeking to ensure equality by providing that those who pay PRSI on the types of income set out in the section will become reckonable for the same benefits as others who pay PRSI.  It is a pity that my amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that it would impose a charge on the people.

As I indicated yesterday, illness and injury benefits are being cut by means of the provision doubling the number of days that must elapse before the benefits are paid.  This is a major change in the PRSI system and is, as I noted yesterday, the equivalent of a cut of &euro;112.80.  The consequences of this change will be suffered by employees in some cases and employers in others.  The measure is a retrograde step as people cannot afford to cover the additional costs they will incur.<\/p><p>  Illness and injury benefits were introduced to ensure those who suffered illness or injury received some type of support to enable them to continue to pay their mortgages and household utility bills, which can increase significantly.  By extending the period that must elapse before these benefits kick in, the Minister appears to expect that most people will set aside one week's wages to cover their additional costs should they fall ill or become injured.

The elimination of the telephone allowance is an example of such a reduction.  Many of those who claim the household benefits package paid contributions throughout their working lives and had an expectation that they would receive a package of important benefits in addition to their income.  <\/p><p>  One needs to closely study social welfare and pensions legislation to find out what is buried in its provisions.  We are repeatedly informed that the core rates of social welfare are being protected.  While I accept that statement is true, it leads people to believe that savings in the social welfare budget will be achieved exclusively through anti-fraud measures.  Savings made in the area of fraud are not as significant as is frequently made out.  It is important, therefore, that changes in the household benefits package are not introduced in secondary legislation, namely, regulations or statutory instruments, but are implemented in an up-front manner, which gives Deputies an opportunity to debate the merits of keeping these benefits.  There is, for example, significant merit in keeping people connected by telephone given the inadequacy of mobile technology in some locations.<\/p><p> I refer to illness benefit.  It is very big issue for people who are on a low wage to lose not only a week's wages but six days' wages.  Six days of non-payment, when one is legitimately out sick, is a big knock for a household, in particular a low income one.  Very often it takes a long time to recover from that.  It may not seem like a big deal but it will have a very big impact on people in the low to middle income group who would have many commitments.

As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh highlighted, people are paying more but are getting less.  It was a particularly cruel, mean and devious act to remove the bereavement grant from people who paid for it.  People do not mind paying tax and paying their contribution to society if they believe that when they are sick or in trouble or their families are in trouble, they are entitled to things.

People must have a landline to use the pendent alarm.  I would say there is anything up to 1 million of them in use.  Has any examination been carried out on the cutbacks last year and on the removal of the telephone allowance?<\/p><p>  People will disconnect their landlines.  In many cases, they will have family with mobile telephones but many of them will not have the use of mobile telephones.  However, this equipment will not work with mobile telephones.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Justice and Equality are giving money towards these schemes but the Department of Social Protection is literally rending them useless.  People are isolated, in particular in rural areas but also in towns and villages, and this was a lifeline for them.  There was two-way communication for them with the monitoring station and friendships were formed.  Since last year many people have been disconnected because they could not pay the telephone rental.

Approximately 135,000 contributory pensioners and in the region of 53,000 non-contributory pensioners are in receipt of the household benefits package.

In the context of Deputy O'Dea's amendment relates to the broadening of the PRSI base, which is what is set out in section 3.  The measure in section 3 is a result of the demographic changes to which I have just referred and which, happily, mean that there are pensioners and that retired people are living longer.  Outside anything else which might affect the finances of the Department, the annual pressure resulting from these changes - in monetary terms - is approximately &euro;190 million.  I am obliged to provide the latter from tight existing resources.  In the context of Deputy O'Dea's proposal, the base-broadening measures are being brought forward because the Social Insurance Fund - which is the cornerstone of our social insurance system - has a deficit. That deficit was well over &euro;1 billion in each of the past two years and it will be of the same order again this year.  Next year, however, as a result of the numbers of people returning to work - CSO figures show that some 33,000 more people were at work at the end of June - the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund will be in the region of &euro;700 million to &euro;800 million.<\/p><p>  Some Members, including Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, have proposed that the level of employer's PRSI should be increased.  Others, including Deputy Grealish - who is a small business owner and employer - advocate that it should not be increased.  There is a debate in this regard.  Above and beyond that and as a consequence of the economic crash, however, people in this country are obliged to pay the universal social charge, USC.  The latter is a charge, not a contribution.  One of the debates in which we should perhaps engage in the future is whether some of the money collected via the USC should actually take the form of a contribution.  The USC was introduced by the previous Government at a time of absolute crisis and it is simply being levied as a charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500006#D04300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382693100,"counter":90,"content":"<p>As the 30 minutes for this part of the debate have concluded, I am obliged to put the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500006#D04400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1382693100,"counter":91,"content":"<p>What we are doing now is engaging in a modest expansion whereby people with other incomes of less than &euro;3,174 will not be charged the additional amount of PRSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500006#D04500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382693100,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Unless there is co-operation and in view of how the business for today has been ordered, I am of the view that these proceedings are going to be a complete disaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500006#D04600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1382693100,"counter":93,"content":"<p>They are already a disaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500006#D04700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382693100,"counter":94,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382693100,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I am obliged to adhere to the order of the House which has been set down.

As the Minister will be aware, some 975,000 women are active in Ireland's labour market.  Of these, more than 500,000 have children, which means they have caring responsibilities.  My concern about this section is that the reduction in maternity benefit from the State at a time when, inevitably, the private sector is also reducing its benefits for working mothers, or in some cases abolishing payments on top of the benefit, is likely to have three effects.  First, it is likely to act as a disincentive to come off the live register and seek employment for young women on it who may wish to have children.  There is a clear disincentive there.  Second, it might lead to an increase in illegal discriminatory practices by employers.  Third, it may affect child welfare, as women may be forced to return to the workforce faster than they would have planned in order to obtain a full salary to meet all their bills and financial requirements.<\/p><p>  I believe the consequences of this section are unintended, particularly the effect of the introduction of the benefit cut in January 2014.  That operational date means that existing pregnant mothers are now essentially being unfairly targeted.  I fear that a large swathe of women who planned their pregnancies on an economic basis will lose approximately &euro;800 because of the operational date of this legislation.  They have had no forewarning.  Our very simple amendments suggest a date of September for those women or, alternatively, a more immediate date of April, which obviously would have less effect in terms of the overall savings expected.  I have estimated that the gross cost would be less than 25% of the expected savings, or &euro;7 million, if the April date were implemented.  If the Minister was to willing to accept that amendment to this section, it would be a very generous and constructive move and ensure that pregnant women who were planning on the basis of the existing maternity arrangements would not be discriminated against.  Essentially, we are appealing to the Minister to postpone the introduction of this cut until April at the earliest so that expectant mothers are not unfairly targeted or discriminated against.  I hope the Minister will consider accepting the amendment and looking at the other amendments we have tabled relating to the impact of measures on the number of women entering the labour force, which, as we know, has been declining since 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500008#F00700","speaker":"1186"},{"type":"speech","time":1382694000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Mathews wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500008#F00800","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1382694000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500008#F00900","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1382694000,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I support the amendment, even though I oppose this section as a whole, because the amendment at least will capture those who are pregnant and planning their maternity leave and possibly their unpaid leave thereafter.  People make those assumptions, and justifiably so, because when one pays tax or PSRI one has some expectation that there will not be a substantial change in one's lifetime.  As we have seen recently, that does not stand up, particularly under this Government, because this is not the first change to maternity benefit.  The first change was to tax it.  Again, that had a negative effect on all those who were pregnant or planning at the time.  The consequences of that affect women as we speak.<\/p><p>  This amendment proposes that the cut to maternity benefit rates, which is what it is, will come into effect in January, so there is some logic behind Deputy Creighton's proposal.  This cut will mean that the majority of maternity benefit recipients will see their weekly payment cut by &euro;32.  That is a substantial cut for anybody.  I am surprised at the Minister, given the party to which she belongs and its history - perhaps not in respect of its history, because it has introduced some retrograde measures when it has been in Government before.  However, it has never introduced a measure that goes as far as to target those who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant in the future.  <\/p><p>  As Deputy Creighton said, the Government will end up forcing some women back to work early.<\/p><p>That is contrary to everything that has been in the programme of work of this Government and its predecessors which aimed at encouraging women to breastfeed.  If the Government is forcing women back to work, not every employer facilitates breastfeeding or child care arrangements which will allow the child to be nearby or the mother to leave the workplace on a frequent basis.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this measure because it is a retrograde step.  I am not the only person saying this.  A number of organisations, as well as many Deputies in this Chamber, have come out against the cut.  Women who are currently pregnant or will in the future become pregnant will be affected by it.  One constituent wrote the following to me:<blockquote>The recent cut to maternity benefit, following as it does closely behind the taxation of this benefit that came into play in July, can be interpreted in only one way.  You don't want working women to have families.  I have been in full time tax paying employment since I was 19 years old and I have now been working almost half my life.  I am the only source of income in my family as my husband has been unable to find employment and we are not in receipt of any social welfare benefit...<br \/><br \/> Although the HSE publicly state that babies should be breast fed exclusively for six months, most women have to return to work somewhere around the baby's five month birthday.  Maternity leave must be taken at 38 weeks at the latest and 37 to 42 weeks in a normal term.  The HSE also encourages continued breast feeding to two years in line with WHO guidelines but there is no support in the legislation beyond six months.  If you want healthy future taxpayers you must rethink your fiscal policies.  Before the benefit was taxed some of us were maybe able to save a bit so we could avail of unpaid leave to extend the time at home with our babies.<\/blockquote>These cuts will restrict that possibility and will force many women back to work when they should be spending time with their newborn children.  This is a retrograde step for women in Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500008#F01000","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382694600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>As we are discussing sections 5 and 6 together, whatever we say about section 5 is equally applicable to section 6, which deals with adoptive leave.  I am opposed to these sections.  Let us consider what has happened to maternity benefit in less than 12 months.  In last year's budget, the Minister for Finance decided, for the first time in history, that maternity benefit was to be taxed at the marginal rate.  In most cases people who pay tax on their maternity benefits are taxed at 41% because people enter the marginal rate very early under the Irish tax system.  This Bill proposes that the rates of maternity benefit be standardised.  The measure is not being presented as a cut.  Standardisation means that some people who earn less than &euro;230 per week will be brought up to that rate and those above it will be brought down.  The difficulty is that approximately 96% of recipients are over the new standardised rates.  In effect, it is a cut.  The cumulated amount taken from the pocket of an expectant mother paying tax at the 41% rate averages approximately &euro;3,500 between this cut and the taxation provisions.<\/p><p>  For all the reasons set out by other speakers, this is a very retrograde step.  Ironically, it comes less than one week after a body which the Government consulted, the advisory group on the early years strategy, proposed that the length of maternity benefit be doubled from six months to 12 months.  We are now going in the opposite direction by reducing the benefits paid over six months.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs said she would fight to have the advisory group's proposal implemented.  Judging by what she has already allowed to happen to maternity benefit, excuse me if I am not bursting with confidence about her ability and prospects for success in that regard.<\/p><p>  There is no chance the Minister, Deputy Burton, will withdraw this section but I think Deputy Creighton's amendment is very reasonable.  It is particularly unfair that women who are already pregnant will bear the brunt of this.  If the amendment was to be accepted - I think at little or no cost to the Exchequer - these women could at least be exempted from the impact of this change.  I have been approached by pregnant women who will be suffering from the impact of this cut.  It is like applying a tax increase or a social welfare reduction retrospectively.  It is very unfair and, while I am totally opposed to the section, the least the Minister can do is accept Deputy Creighton's amendment.  I speak more in hope than expectation but it is a very reasonable proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500009#G00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382694600,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The amount of time allocated for this debate is ridiculous given that the D&aacute;il will not even be sitting next week.

If one wants a demonstration of the patriarchal nature of Irish politics, one need only look at this section and its deliberate targeting of expectant mothers with a reduction in maternity benefit for the vast majority of them.  As with many other sections in this Bill, it is indicative of what has been happening since the outset of the crisis, namely, the gradual erosion of people's protections and security under the social welfare system.  I cannot understand how the Minister can bring forward a measure of this nature.  Most people will find it quite bizarre that she proposes to cut maternity benefit.  We cannot consider this Bill in isolation from the Government's capacity to generate revenue, which it has failed to do, in the overall budgetary process.

There was an opportunity to raise revenue through the budget.  The wealth taxes that were introduced last year, and much lauded by the Minister, Deputy Burton, as countermeasures to some of the odious decisions in budget 2013 are failing to yield revenue from wealthy people in this country.  This budget is instead imposing levies on people who cannot afford them.  It takes away from expectant women and families who want to adopt children.  The amount being taken, &euro;32, is not insignificant.  It is appalling to think that the figures produced this week are not yielding the revenue expected from the wealth taxes introduced last year.

On top of the child benefit cuts imposed last year and the taxing of maternity benefit, many will not be able to have children.<\/p><p>  As with all of these cuts, the least well-off will be hit hardest.

Add together automatic pay rises in the public sector since the collapse and the approximate &euro;700 million for increments in the budget next year.  Compare that with &euro;20 million.<\/p><p>  As the Minister knows, consistent research across the world shows that social transfers that go directly to the mothers of young children are passed on almost entirely to the welfare of the children.  This is accepted policy worldwide.  Instead, we are taking &euro;832 away from the welfare of newborn babies.  If Deputy O'Dea's figures are correct and the Minister, Deputy Noonan's tax cuts from last year are included, the overall figure is &euro;3,500 that used to go directly to the welfare of newborn babies.

We are told that the payment is being standardised, but 23,000 of the 23,500 people who benefit from the payment are on the high rate, so they will take a hit of &euro;32 every week.

The consequence of that reduction is that more men are going back to work because construction has begun to pick up slightly again.  What the Deputy was saying was basically a fallacy.  He is well up enough on statistics to know that.  Pressure on the social insurance fund has resulted in an enormous deficit.  The fund is the core way in which we make a whole variety of payments, particularly to contributory pensioners, as well as widows and widowers who have a contributory entitlement.  That fund has been in serious deficit since the crash because of the reduction in the number of people in employment.  The fund is beginning to recover slightly because more people are going back to work, as Deputy Donnelly acknowledged.

It concerns giving the Department of Social Protection more powers to investigate whether social welfare benefits provided from the State - either child benefit or jobseeker's allowance - have been used abroad and therefore are not being used for their intended purpose.  It is fair to say that the Minister has made it a mark of her savings strategy to tackle welfare fraud and I believe the proposed amendment would help in this objective.<\/p><p>  Persons who are regularly absent from the State may not be genuinely seeking employment.  That is clear.  Persons who routinely withdraw money from their bank account at locations that are not in any way adjacent to or convenient to their place of residence on a regular basis may not be available for employment, or genuinely seeking employment, as is required to fulfil the criteria for jobseeker's allowance, or may be working elsewhere while claiming.  The purpose of these proposed amendments is to permit investigators to review patterns in a person's financial transactions that could indicate systematic withdrawals abroad or at locations that are not consistent with the normal patterns for persons residing and working in their locality.<\/p><p>  Depending on the experience gained from reviewing bank accounts in jobseeker's cases, there may be a case for extending this type of activity to other benefits and universal payments to detect cases of potential abuse.  Examples would include where a claimant is deceased or otherwise does not meet the conditions for receipt by virtue of residence or employment abroad, or the receipts of earnings that do not fall within the normal income tax system, or perhaps that are consistent with the benefit being claimed.  In the case of child benefit where the children reside in the EU but not in the State, analysis of bank statements of the accounts used for receipt of the benefit may provide very valuable insights on how unwarranted recourse to that scheme might be better managed by the Department officials.<\/p><p>  Through the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, the Minister has already been provided with additional powers to take funds directly from bank accounts, so if she could equally monitor transactions or lodgments which are based on geography, that may well give the Minister additional firepower to tackle welfare fraud and thus reduce the amount of more difficult and savage benefit cuts that she has been forced to make.  Essentially, what I am advocating is that the savings which have to be found to fulfil our objectives for 2014 and beyond should be savings made from people who are genuinely defrauding the State, rather than those who are genuinely the most vulnerable in our society.  I believe that this proposal would help the Minister in achieving that goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500013#L00300","speaker":"1186"},{"type":"speech","time":1382696700,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I have four other speakers and the Minister would like to reply, so I will keep one minute at the end for her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500013#L00400","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382696700,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I do not know whether it was an order of the House which decided how much time each of us will get, but even though it is seven minutes, I will try to be brief.  This section deals with the injury benefit and Deputy Creighton's interesting proposal does not relate to the specifics of this section, but is an insertion of a different issue altogether.  We have already had a very brief discussion - due to the guillotine - about the illness benefit in section 4.  Both of these benefits are being cut to the same extent.  The number of days without payment is being doubled from three to six, and that represents a cut of &euro;112.80.  Those who are ill and those who are injured are going to suffer the consequences of that cut because there is no entitlement to statutory sick pay.  In some cases, the sick person would cover the cost and in other cases it is the employers who would do so.  We have heard quite a lot about employers struggling to retain jobs and the cost of that.<\/p><p>  This is a blunt revenue raising issue and it gives the lie to what was contained in the programme for Government that this Government would protect the vulnerable.  Who is more vulnerable than those who are sick or ill in our society?  I am reminded of the old slogan that the cuts would hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped, but in this Bill it is the young, the old, the pregnant, the disabled and those who are injured and ill in our society.

However, in this budget the Minister literally is providing cradle-to-grave austerity and to hit people at the saddest times in their lives really is obnoxious.  No other word describes it and as other Deputies have noted, this will hit at the least well-off.  Death is a terrible time for people, as well as being extremely stressful, and it is simply appalling to add to that stress by imposing a further financial burden on less well-off families while they are trying to bury their loved ones.  As it stood, the bereavement grant of &euro;800 would not even pay a fraction of the cost of a funeral these days.  Even in death, the inequality in society manifests itself, as those who are less well off are under pressure, are stressed and are pinned to their collars to bury their loved ones.  This small support that was available to them now is being pulled away from them by a Labour Party Minister.  She should be ashamed of herself about this measure.  She should withdraw it, like so many of these other nasty, ruthless and cruel cuts she is imposing in this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O01600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I heard Deputy Boyd Barrett echo a point made by other Members about the cradle to the grave.  In fact, the cuts extend from the womb to the tomb, because they also encompass those cuts to maternity benefit with which Members dealt earlier.  This particular measure is one of the saddest cuts with which any government could come up.  It targets those who are bereaved, for whom some relief had been available and which would contribute to an extent to the cost of a funeral.  During yesterday's debate, I mentioned the average cost of a funeral in general across the country is approximately &euro;4,000 or upwards.  However, in the city of Dublin, one would not get change out of &euro;10,000.  Were one frugal, one might manage to have a funeral for &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000 but in so doing, one would be lucky to have the cost of a hearse included.<\/p><p>  The bereavement grant was promised as part of the range of benefits arising from PRSI payments and people now are beginning to question the benefit of the PRSI system if the benefits they are meant to derive therefrom are being cut.  Members have already dealt with the cut to maternity benefit.  In addition, the duration of jobseeker's benefit was cut earlier this year from 12 to nine months.  Members have only just dealt with injury benefit and the changes to illness benefit.  In addition, they will deal later with measures in respect of invalidity pension.  While the Minister will claim the reason for all this is the obligation to manage the Social Insurance Fund, I note Opposition Members put forward proposals on how to address the shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund.  In any event, it was set up in such a way that there would be times when it was short and times of plenty.  These amendments were positive proposals to increase PRSI payments from companies that could afford it.  They would not affect companies that were struggling or barely hanging on to employees but those which are making an absolute fortune in this country because of our tax regimes.  Some of those in our society who can afford it could be asked to make a higher contribution.  In addition, this Bill does not deal, as promised, with PRSI for employers to allow them to avail of some of these benefits.  I do not know whether the Minister heard my contribution yesterday when I referred to the costs of funerals in Dublin but she definitely needs to think again about this measure.  It is taking &euro;17 million out of the pockets of those who are bereaved and shame on her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O01700","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>As there will be other speakers, I will not labour the issue but this is a particularly contemptible and pitiless cut.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh stated, people have paid for this benefit, as it is part of that for which one pays one's social insurance.  One does not get a bereavement grant unless one satisfies the appropriate contribution conditions but from henceforth, while one will continue to contribute at the same rate - some people have had PRSI extended to income that did not bear it previously - one will experience the gradual erosion of one's benefits.  In other words, on the one hand there is the continued burden of increased PRSI and additional PRSI while on the other, there is a gradual erosion of the benefits to which it is meant to give rise.<\/p><p>  I deeply resent the Government's explanation for the withdrawal of this bereavement grant or rather its justification for it, when it claims that those who are badly stuck can apply to their community welfare officers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O01800","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>They are not there any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O01900","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I would not like to give that advice to my constituents in Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O02000","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Half the offices are closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O02100","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The budget has been cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O02200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Not only are the offices closed and the budget cut but the average of what one currently receives in Limerick and the mid-west region is hardly worth speaking about, because the budget for such exceptional needs payments has been cut repeatedly.  At a recent meeting of the social affairs committee, I confirmed it had been cut to such an extent that community welfare officers have referred people to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other similar organisations on the basis that their own budget had expired.  Consequently, it will not do much good for new widows and widowers to approach such officers, only to find themselves referred to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.<\/p><p>  I do not know what sort of world the Government is living in but from experience in my own constituency, I can tell the Minister about many people who qualify for the bereavement grants.  I know families in receipt of social welfare or with low incomes who are entitled to the bereavement grants.  However, having received the grant, the rising cost of funerals - the average cost in Limerick is approximately &euro;5,000 - has meant I have then been obliged to apply on their behalf to the community welfare officer for a top-up grant.  Moreover, even on getting a small top-up grant, the funeral bill is still not paid completely.  As an example of how far the Government appears to be divorced from reality, the Minister for Education and Skills was asked about this issue on radio recently.  In his response, he stated the problem was that funerals had become too expensive and this expense was being driven by the bereavement grant, by what process I do not know.  He also went on to suggest there was insufficient competition in the sector.  Obviously, the Minister for Education and Skills envisages that on becoming a widow or a widower, a person will hold a tendering process and invite undertakers to make competitive bids.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O02300","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>It would have to be a European Union tender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O02400","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382698200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>One could go to Bulgaria for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O02500","nonspeaker":"A Deputy"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>It would take six months to process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500016#O02600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>That really is contemptible.

By bringing in this measure the Government is attacking the most vulnerable, the elderly in our society.  This week alone we helped three elderly people who called to my office in Galway to fill out an application for the bereavement grant, and it was stressful and difficult for them to do that.<\/p><p>  The average bill for a basic funeral in Galway is between &euro;3,000 and  &euro;4,000.  The cost of one funeral was &euro;3,854 and this grant meant a great deal to the family.  In one case I dealt with recently I had to contact the undertaker to ask if they would arrange a staged payment scheme for the family and the undertaker agreed to that.  Such payment arrangements are now being made.  This grant means a great deal to families who could not even afford to pay for a cup of tea for people after the funeral.  <\/p><p>  As  my colleague, Deputy O'Dea said, I am sure there are areas in the Minister's Department or in other Departments where the savings that will be achieved from the abolition of this grant could be found.  I presume the decision to make these harsh cuts was forced on the Minster by her Cabinet colleagues.  The savings that will be achieved from this measure should be found somewhere else.  I ask the Minister not to hit the most vulnerable, the people who built this State, who put us where we are now and worked hard all their lives but who now unfortunately find themselves in a situation where they do not have any money saved.  They are living basically on what money they get and find that when their husband or wife dies, or even a son or a daughter in some cases, they do not have the money to pay for their funeral.

The first is that people have paid into this.  If a person passes away before reaching their 66th birthday this may be the only entitlement claimed in respect of them in terms of PRSI after their years of contributions.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled my amendment out of order, but I ask the Minister to consider it.  I believe she is creating a serious anomaly here that will lead to significant overpayments.  The bereavement grant is &euro;850 and it is paid out in respect of 20,000 people a year.  If account is taken of those who receive the widowed grant of &euro;6,000, that leaves approximately 19,000 claimants who only receive the bereavement grant.  More than 200,000 people are in receipt of electronic payments of their contributory old age pension.  Up to now those people, or their next of kin, would have been entitled to the bereavement grant.  I cite the example of an elderly person, who has been receiving their pension payments electronically and has no assets and no savings, who passes away and has no surviving souse.  The funeral takes place and the undertaker sends out the bill for &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 six or eight weeks after the funeral.  The family members then decide they had better sort out everything.  They do not have access to the deceased's bank account because the proceeds are frozen on the person's death.  In the intervening period &euro;230.30 is being paid into the deceased's account every week.  There is no trigger mechanism for the Department to indicate that this person has died.  Money continues to be paid into the bank account until the solicitor eventually contacts the Department two or three months down the road notifying it that this person has died.  When the accounts are settled priority is given to the funeral expenses before the Department gets its money refunded.  Instead of paying the &euro;850 towards the funeral costs, the Department will end up paying the full cost of that funeral before it gets the balance back in a repayment.  I believe the Minister is causing a serious anomaly because this grant causes a trigger within the Department to suspend the contributory pension that is being paid electronically.  There is no other mechanism in place currently to make that happen, or is it the case that the Minister will have Department officials listening to the local radio stations, contacting undertakers on a regular basis to find out has die?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P00700","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Minister might want to respond briefly to those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P00800","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>In the case of a person who dies, there is a range of supports-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P00900","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>What are they?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01000","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>-----available from the Department of Social Protection which are very valuable and more valuable than the bereavement grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01100","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1382698800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>They are probably more expensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01200","nonspeaker":"A Deputy"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Many speakers spoke about pensioners.  If one partner of a pensioner couple dies, their spouse continues to get the social welfare payment of the deceased spouse for six weeks.  That is worth roughly &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,400 depending on the rate the person receives.  The second and the biggest payment the Department makes is in respect of a person who becomes widowed who is entitled to the widow's contributory pension either on their or their spouse's contributions or on the basis of a non-contribution pension if their means are not sufficient.  In terms of the social welfare budget, approximately &euro;1.3 billion a year is currently spent in that respect.  It is a very significant amount of money and again we have kept all those core payments intact.<\/p><p>  Second, a widow, widower or surviving partner who has a dependent child or children, up to the age of 18 or in full-time education up to the age of 22, receives a cash grant that is not means tested of &euro;6,000.   Those are significant supports to the immediate next of kin of the person who has died.  I hope that Deputies agree that the immediate next of kin of the person who has died, particularly the widow, widower or the dependent children, are the people who should receive the most significant level of help.  That is the way the Department has done it and will continue to do it.  Where a person dies in an accident, an accident funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid and that grant will continue to be paid.<\/p><p>  A number of Deputies raised another issue at different points in time, namely, that for the past number of years, including this year, the Department will spend just over &euro;5 million on funeral expenses in respect of approximately 2,500 funerals.  I advise Deputy O'Dea that the average support given by the community welfare office in Limerick to people who are in the distressful situation that he correctly described of having very limited means is around &euro;1,500.  Unfortunately as the Deputy is aware there have been many deaths of younger people in Limerick, leaving widows behind and people who have been in receipt of social welfare, as has the spouse or the partner who has died.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Are you going to go into the graveyard and take it off them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>These payments are far more significant than the &euro;850 payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382698800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Deputy, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01700","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>For instance, in Tipperary the average payment - Deputy Healy is possibly not aware of this but I suspect he is very aware of it - by the community welfare service-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01800","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I am very aware of the fact that the Minister is taking &euro;850 off people whose spouses have died.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P01900","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>-----in supporting funerals so far this year has been about &euro;1,300.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P02000","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The Government is also reducing the exceptional needs payment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P02100","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The suggestion that this State, through its spend of &euro;20 billion-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P02200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>You will be going around the graveyard looking for-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P02300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Deputy McGrath, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500017#P02400","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1382698800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The Minister has no shame.

If somebody genuinely cannot get a training or an education place and is under 26 years of age and in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, cutting that allowance will not create any extra employment.  How will it create extra employment if the training or education place is not there?<\/p><p>  In regard to employment, there are 32 applicants for every job vacancy.  If one cuts somebody's dole, or jobseeker's allowance, and he or she gets on his or her bike, as advised by Norman Tebbit many years ago, and eventually manages to get a job, what about the other 31?  If there are genuinely no jobs for people, how will cutting their social welfare create those jobs?<\/p><p>  It also seems to have escaped the Government's attention that many, among the army of young unemployed, are highly qualified people - graduates, people with honours degrees, masters degrees, doctorates and professional qualifications.  They do not need any further training or education; they need a job.  If, with the best will in the world, they cannot get a job, which should not surprise anybody, how will cutting their social welfare create more jobs and tackle the unemployment crisis?<\/p><p>  The only way I see it working is that if social welfare for those for whom training places are not available and for whom a job is not available - educated people, in particular, who do not need further training and education - is cut sufficiently, they will be encouraged to emigrate.  That will make the unemployment figures look better, which seems to be the thinking behind this proposal.  If it is otherwise, I would like to hear the Government's justification for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500019#R00800","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382699700,"counter":371,"content":"<p>On a point of order, we were told earlier that the order in which speakers were called was according to the list.

The Government is adding to what the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration did in the 2010 budget.  I recall members of the Minister's party, which was in opposition at the time, leaping up and down and stating that they were completely opposed to the measure being introduced by the then Government.  To a large extent, they were able to put the argument against changes to jobseeker's allowance which would establish a different standard for young people in a much better way than I ever could do.  What is being done now is much worse than what was done in 2010.  The Minister is cutting the allowance for young people by 30%, which is an utter disgrace.<\/p><p> Outside of those who are caught in the poverty traps that have been created, people in this country have a clear incentive to work.  Successive reports have shown that this incentive takes the form of the increase in income which comes from being in employment.  However, the Minister is penalising young people supposedly because they are sitting at home waiting for the work to come to them.  The work is not there and the various reports have shown that there are 32 unemployed people for every job vacancy.  It is not possible to squeeze people into jobs that do not exist.  In addition, it is not possible to squeeze all of the young people to whom I refer into training opportunities or education courses that do not exist.  While we welcome the announcement of additional places, these do not in any way match up with the number of people who are unemployed.  For example, more than 20,000 young people are unemployed but the Minister only announced an extra 3,500 places.  The number of places and the number of people seeking them simply do not fit with each other.<\/p><p> The savings that will be obtained as a result of the proposed cut will not be used to create additional opportunities.  Rather, the moneys involved will disappear into the black hole of the Exchequer.  I referred to this matter at length on Second Stage and what I said stands.  I will not repeat what I stated at that point, particularly in view of the fact that quite a number of Deputies wish to highlight how disgraceful this change is.  I ask the Minister to listen to the points of view of a variety of organisations prior to the Bill's final passage.  I refer, for example, to the National Youth Council of Ireland and Focus Ireland.  The latter has shown that the number of young people who are homeless has increased as a result of the austerity measures that have been introduced.  The measure before the House is going to force even more young people into homelessness.  On the basis of that fact alone, I urge the Minister to row back on it.  She must also recognise that what is being done is forcing many young people to emigrate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500019#R02500","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382700300,"counter":389,"content":"<p>One of the things that was very evident during the Celtic tiger era was that there was virtually full employment.  There is no real evidence, therefore, that people are lazy or that they will not take up employment.  What has always been evident is the fact that a certain percentage of those on the live register were people who were in transition between jobs.  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, people who were unemployed were almost accused of being spongers.  The latter word resonated for a long time afterwards.  We are at risk of placing an entire group of people into a particular category.  It is as if they are almost being blamed for the fact that they are unemployed.  I completely accept the point that the best thing for those who are unemployed is training and education.  However, many of the individuals were are discussing have primary and master's degrees and some even have PhDs.  I met a person last week who wanted to obtain access to the MOMENTUM programme.  He is eight weeks short of being a full year out of work, which is the requirement to qualify for the programme.  A place is available on the particular scheme in which he is interested.  This is because there were not enough people to fill the places on offer when the scheme was originally established and, as a result, it had to be postponed.  It must be recognised that people's circumstances sometimes do not match up to the requirements for the type of course that would lead to their receiving the necessary training to enable them to obtain employment when the course comes to an end.<\/p><p>  I recently spoke to some people involved in the hospitality sector and I was alarmed to discover that individuals are offering to work within that sector for well under the minimum wage.  If this happens and if it becomes a feature, people's prospects for earning a living wage will be driven right down.  There is a need to examine the sector to which I refer to discover whether what I have outlined is happening on a small scale or whether it is wholesale in nature.  It would be a matter of some concern if the latter were the case.<\/p><p>  The primary point I wish to make relates to whether the proposed measure is even legal, particularly as it discriminates on age grounds.  It is important that this aspect be dealt with.  I have a fundamental objection to targeting a group of people, may of whom are very well trained and educated, and almost blaming them for the fact that they are unemployed.

We have already dealt with women who are having children, people who are burying their dead and those who are injured or become sick at work.  Now we are moving on to young people.  The Minister laughably tries to justify this measure with references to labour activation.  I am sure she is aware that the real activation for young people is to leave the country.  The fact that they are leaving certainly shows they are not sitting at home in front of plasma-screen TVs, lazing about the place waiting for someone to offer them employment, or living in luxury - as the Minister might see it - on social welfare payments.  These individuals are leaving because they are energetic, educated and dynamic and there is nothing here for them.  How much more dynamic and energetic does the Minister want them to be?  They want jobs, but what she is doing is attacking their incomes and providing them with lots of fake jobs.<\/p><p>  It is important to place on record the fact that officials from the Department of Finance came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and highlighted an anomaly in the Government's figures.  This anomaly relates to an apparent drop in unemployment and a slight rise in employment in circumstances in which no corresponding economic growth had occurred.  The officials could not explain the reason for this, but there is an explanation, namely, that everybody is leaving the country and that the so-called jobs that are being created are not real jobs.  People are paid virtually nothing when they take up these jobs but they are still classed as no longer being unemployed.  The officials stated that the surveys carried out by the CSO ask people whether they are employed or unemployed.  If someone is on a T&uacute;s, JobBridge or JobsPlus scheme or if he or she is involved with the Government's new brainchild, the Gateway project - which is a disgrace - under which people on social welfare payments will be given an additional &euro;20 per week to do council workers' jobs, thereby essentially doing away with real jobs, he or she will be classed as being employed but there will be no corresponding growth in GDP because the person is not actually contributing to the economy but is in a fake job.  Such jobs do not give rise to growth.<\/p><p>This explains the anomaly pointed out by the Department of Finance.  We need real jobs.  They can happen only with investment, not by taking money from people, which is an attack on them and on their spending power and in turn damages the economy.  We need real investment to create jobs.  That could be done by taxing wealth instead of attacking young people, as many on this side of the House have said time and again.  It is a disgrace that the Minister is making this attack on young people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500020#S01300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382700900,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Focus Ireland noted that the policy objectives of the Government in making these changes were to create incentives for young people in training and employment.  There is, however, concern about the unintended consequences of these actions.  One major concern is housing, which I mentioned when I spoke last night.  Some young people can afford to stay in private rented accommodation now but will no longer be able to do so.  They are probably there because of overcrowding where they originally lived.  If they lived in local authority housing this move will increase stress on local authorities.  We know that Dublin City Council does not have enough housing to meet demand.  That is one consequence of this.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that this will drive more young people into homeless services whose resources are already strained.  If young people go into emergency hostel accommodation it will be virtually impossible for them to access the jobs or training opportunities that the Minister says they will get.  The hostels will charge them between &euro;50 and &euro;75 per week.  That will not leave them with much money to live any type of life with dignity.  They will then go out begging.  It will be necessary to put more resources into homeless services which will negate the saving from this move. <\/p><p>  I was a teacher so I know about the bright, articulate, great young people who have come through our education system, on whom a great deal of money has been spent.

The Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform examined this matter during the year and saw that some of what the banks did was an excuse for contact in that all they had done was to send out letters.<\/p><p>It has failed from the point of view of getting the banks to deal with people in a way that results in sustainable ways forward for people who cannot repay their mortgages.  The presumption is that people will be out of work for a full year.  What will happen if people are out of work for short periods during the year?  The mortgage interest supplement allowed people in such situations to at least meet the interest portion of their repayments, thereby not reaching the point of having to defer payments into the future.  No provision is made for this type of flexibility in respect of people who find themselves temporarily unemployed and who on return to work can again take up paying their mortgages.<\/p><p> This issue cannot be looked at in isolation.

At that time the leader of the Labour Party was promising to burn the bondholders.<\/p><p>  Many speakers have referred to the 100,000 people that will be affected by this cut.  I believe it will affect many more people, some of whom are proud and continue to struggle without telling anyone, hoping their situation will improve and that they will be able to keep paying to keep the roof over their heads.  This Bill also introduces cut to benefits for under 25s living at home and many other cuts.

People want to trade out, but the banks will not talk to them.  They fooled us all into voting for the bank guarantee.  I said I voted for it and I made a profound mistake.  We were completely fooled and blindfolded.  I know the Minister voted against it, but I voted against the bailout because it was a clean out.  They have codded us all and they are still codding us and are not dealing with people.  The Minister knows that, as does the Minister of State and everyone else from dealing with these issues in their constituency.  Deputy Donnelly pointed out that this measure was futile for some people, but it kept other people in the game.   However far behind they were in the game, they were on the pitch.  This is really putting them off the pitch and it is a severe blow.  I would hate to refer to the Minister as a wonder woman, because I think she will be remembered in history as a blunder woman.

The first point they made was about the lack of proper time to consider all of these cuts and changes which will have a massive impact on those people who get absolutely no say on what the budget will be about.  They saw this abolition of the mortgage interest supplement as being contrary to the stated policy of the Government.  They want the mortgage interest supplement to be retained at least until the Central Bank can produce satisfactory evidence that lenders have sustainable strategies to maintain people in their homes without the need for the supplement.  That is a very valid request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500027#Z00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1382703300,"counter":454,"content":"<p>That submission by FLAC had a very interesting quote from the programme for Government 2011-2016, which noted that \"making greater use of mortgage interest supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage payments ... [is a] better and cheaper option than paying rent supplement after a family loses their home\".  The Minister has just taken away one of the supports available to some of the 180,000 people who have ended up in mortgage crisis, not all of whom would qualify for the mortgage interest supplement.  Yesterday saw the publication of a report of the two thirds of local authority home loans which are in arrears, and the newspapers listed them in each county.  That is the scale of it.  The work is not there for people.  The Minister might be correct in the logic that this was supposed to be a short-term scheme, but so is rent allowance yet she is not tackling that, but perhaps that is her plan next year.  We have not seen sight of the HAP, which is the Minister's hapless scheme that she is supposedly bringing forward to address the rent allowance.<\/p><p>  The abolition of mortgage interest supplement is contrary to the Minister's stated policy to try to work on solutions.  The solutions on offer at the moment come down to the Government putting faith in the banks addressing the situation and offering solutions.  Part of the solution offered by the banks is in repossession.  The Central Bank set a target of 20% of offers to be made by the banks to mortgage holders in arrears of over 90 days.  The banks have claimed that they have met that target, but it is only because those banks have issued 14,721 repossession letters in the last number of months, along with 2,439 requests for voluntary surrender in the same period.  Clearly the banks are abusing a system which was flawed in the first place, and are not co-operating with the mortgage holders in the spirit of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  I believe that the Minister is ahead of time, because we have not seen the banks engage properly in that mortgage resolution system.  In the absence of proof of that, the only support that some people were able to rely on, or were hoping to rely on, was the mortgage interest supplement.  The Minister last year changed the criteria to ensure that people were engaged with their banks for over a year before they would qualify, but I believe that people who engaged in the past year are now faced with the fact that the mortgage interest supplement will no longer exist by the time the 12 months are up.  She held out a carrot to them and she withdrew it through this measure.<\/p><p>  This is a retrograde step.  Until there is a proper mortgage resolution process and until there is sufficient social housing in this country that people can fall back on in the event of them not being able to address their mortgage arrears, the Minister should withdraw this measure.

The idea behind mortgage interest supplement is that it is supposed to be a short-term supplement.  The important thing about mortgage supplement is that it is a safety net for people who lose employment.  It allows them to keep their heads above water and ensure that they do not lose their home, pending the opportunity of getting another job.  The difficulty at the moment is that people cannot get alternative employment, but that should not mean that this safety net does not remain in place.<\/p><p>  The Aire St&aacute;it in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was reported in today's newspapers talking about the need for the banks to release capital to allow young people to get mortgages.  What is the point in allowing them to get mortgages when, if they get into difficulty and lose their job, they will end up losing their home in a couple of years and have this additional financial burden placed on top of them?  Have we not learned enough from what has gone on in this country over the last five years to ensure that we have a sensible regime in place?<\/p><p>  The ethos behind government is to give people a hand up and hopefully get them into employment and onto the first steps of the property ladder in this country.  What is the point of encouraging them to go down that road when a basic safety net is not being put in place for them?  If someone has never worked or never owned a home, then they have nothing to lose from this Bill.  However, people who try their damnedest to get into employment and get a roof over the own heads are the people being penalised by this Bill.  I urge the Minister to reconsider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500027#Z00400","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1382703300,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this section.  Deputy Collins just quoted me from a few years ago about the lack of a resolution process and the disaster that was the guarantee.  I stand over every word I said and I am glad the Deputy reminded me of that and of my earlier comments from Danny Blanchflower about the corrosive effect of young people not having a job.  I stand over all those comments.<\/p><p>  Since 2008, the mortgage interest supplement has paid out &euro;319 million.  That money has gone directly to the banks and it has done absolutely nothing for the person's long-term resolution of their mortgage difficulty.  I appreciate the sentiments of the Deputies and their desire to help people to get to a resolution process.<\/p><p>However, this is not a resolution process; this is a cash handout to the banks of the interest on a mortgage for an indefinite number of years without the bank having to engage in any way with the couple, both of whom have lost their jobs, or where the mortgage is clearly unsustainable.  On this the banks are laughing all the way to the bank.  Why would they not?<\/p><p> I have many examples of cases which might help Deputies to understand this.  A couple took out a mortgage of &euro;195,000 and have been on the MIS for approximately seven years.  We have paid their bank - not to the couple involved because it is nothing to do with them - &euro;66,000.  After all those payments, the couple still owe &euro;183,000 and are not a step closer to resolution.  In another case we have paid out &euro;46,000.

The critical thing there is to actually put the resources into the resolution process and to see that people get assistance in the resolution process, as MABS is doing.  We are spending &euro;47 million on MABS and citizens' information.  I agree with the Deputy that they are doing considerable work along with other organisations to help people get to a resolution.  What is the point in having a resolution process and still continuing to pay very large sums of money?  The average sum of money is &euro;26,000 over a four or five-year period and the person has no further resolution.

I have tabled this amendment because I am greatly concerned by this legislation, in that while all Members desire welfare reform and would welcome radical welfare reform that would assist people in the transition from welfare to work, this Bill does the precise opposite.  It is removing the limited safety net the State provides to people who have worked or who are currently in employment.  The subliminal message being sent out by this legislation is while one should take up work, one does so at one's own risk.  This particular message has significant economic consequences as it tells entrepreneurs they are better off playing it safe.  It tells people not to start their own businesses, try to better themselves, take up employment or increase their hours of employment.  Instead, people should be encouraged to do the precise opposite, that is, to take risks, to take the punt and the gamble and, hopefully, to create jobs.<\/p><p>  If one considers the various sections of the Bill, section 4 deals with illness benefit, which is a contributory payment.  Section 5 concerns maternity benefit, which is also a contributory payment.  Sections 6 and 7 deal respectively with adoptive benefit and injury benefit, which are also contributory payments.  The allowances for jobseekers also affect those who make contributions because of the dramatic restriction in jobseeker's benefit.  If one takes the example of a young person who had been successful in gaining employment, who probably had a decent job and who secured a mortgage only to suddenly lose that job, the minute that person's benefit lapses he or she is down to &euro;144 per week.  The supplementary welfare allowance limits are also cut for such people and the mortgage interest supplement will now be abolished.  As a result, there is a need to review immediately and urgently the implications of these decisions on people in employment.<\/p><p>  In fairness to it, the Department is coming up with some novel initiatives.  For example, the new computer package it has developed to show people how they are better off in employment is a welcome development.  However, it is pointless unless it is made available via the Internet to enable people to access it independently.  However, the single most detrimental blow to getting people off the live register and into employment is one of those hidden, dirty decisions made in the budget, namely, the withdrawal of the medical card for people who leave welfare and return to work.  That is a monumental mistake that will force more people to remain on the live register.  I have encountered numerous instances of people who are in employment but who, because the three-year threshold has now finished, are in the process of losing their medical cards.  Consequently, such people are considering either a reduction in their hours or giving up their jobs in order to secure their medical cards because there happen to be medical illnesses in their households.  It is an extremely retrograde step to take this decision.<\/p><p>  My final point also pertains to the under-25s.  The argument is being made by the Government that such people can access the back-to-education allowance and that will be at a higher rate.  What about a 24 or 25 year old who is a graduate?  Many people of that age are graduates, some have masters degrees and a few may even have a PhD.  However, if their degrees are not in a field in which employment is available at present, they must go back to reskill but as matters stand, they are not eligible for the back-to-education allowance because of the progression rule that is in place.  It makes far more sense for progression to be about progressing from the live register and into employment rather than progression in respect of a person's educational qualifications.  Something must be done urgently in this regard because every single day, 200 people are flying out of the country.  It has cost &euro;180,000 of taxpayers' money to educate each such person before he or she leaves, which is a very significant loss to the potential economic development of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500030#CC00300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1382704800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>When speaking on this legislation last night, I made two points.  The first was that the welfare budget should protect the vulnerable but should also encourage people to return to employment.  Many of the measures outlined by Deputy Naughten assisted people who employed people.  Consequently, these measures helped to maintain and create jobs.  One difficulty being experienced in Ireland at present is the reluctance of employers to take on new workers or any workers, due to the amount of regulation and the charges being imposed upon them.<\/p><p>During the past few years many provisions have been eroded.  For example, redundancy payments have been cut in the past few budgets.  Reference was also made to sick pay.  I do not necessarily disagree with the sick pay concept.  Each company should manage its own sick pay but the same principle should apply to the State.  We want there to be measures whereby those in the public sector are subject to the same criteria.<\/p><p> I note that the Minister's party prior to the last election gave a commitment that 12 months after each item of legislation was passed it would be reviewed, whether by the D&aacute;il, a committee or otherwise.  The amendment we put forward proposes a measure along those lines; it is a safety value mechanism.  It is a progressive idea.  The Government should be open to it and should accept not only the letter of it, but the spirit of it.  If errors are made in legislation, we should be prepared to correct them.  Section 10 could have grave social unintended consequences due to the measures outlined in it.  <\/p><p> I have listened to Ministers down the years come in here and outline the thrust and intention of an amendment and what it will achieve, but very often it does not achieve that.  It is visible early on that it will not achieve that, but no change is made to it because there is a reluctance to admit that it was wrong or to amend it.  This is a mechanism that is in everybody's interest.  I strongly urge the Minister of State, now that he is holding the reins for the next few minutes, to show innovation and independent thinking and accept this amendment.  It will not pose any charge on the Exchequer and has no downside.

This is a simple amendment.  It puts an onus on the Minster to effectively job-proof the measures contained in the legislation and their implementation in so far as is possible.

It is important to note it is not only Members of the Oireachtas who are pointing out these realities.  The US Chamber of Commerce in Ireland, which represents businesses that employ approximately 115,000 people, along with the Irish Exporters Association, have expressed their concerns as to what the impact measures, for example, the PRSI measure we have learned about in recent weeks since the budget was announced and other measures contained in this legislation, will have on our competitiveness.  At a time when we have worked extremely hard to improve our competitiveness, we have to be conscious of the fact that exports are declining.  They declined by 3% last year.  We have to take the calls of these organisations seriously.  These are the people who are doing their utmost to create employment in our economy, to grow businesses and to encourage entrepreneurship.

The social welfare system is bedevilled by traps and we seem to be creating more traps as we go along.  Take the position of lone parents and the fact that part-time employment is now a significant phenomenon in this country.  Lone parents, because of their family responsibilities and so on, generally take up part-time employment.  A large percentage of lone parents who are employed are in part-time employment.  Measures were introduced to allow a lone parent to earn a certain amount per week before the lone parent allowance would start to reduce.  That level is being gradually reduced.  I think it is down to &euro;90 per week now and it will be down to &euro;60 per week next year.  With every measure the Government is taking in this regard, it makes it less and less attractive for lone parents to go out to work.  A poverty trap means that a person is better off on social welfare or, alternatively, the difference between what one gets on social welfare and what one gets by going out to work is so marginal and small that it is not worth one's while to go out to work.  With these changes in the lone parent allowance, the Government is creating a poverty trap.  It is narrowing the difference between what the person can get by staying at home and by going out to work.<\/p><p>  There are several other examples in the social welfare area that I could quote.   For example, I know of several cases of people who are working three days per week.  If one works more than three days per week, one does not qualify for jobseeker's allowance; one is automatically disqualified regardless of how small one's earning are for the four days or whatever.  I know several people in that category who would love to work an extra day or more but they are debarred from doing so by the three-day week rule.  <\/p><p>  There are elements of the family income supplement which constitute a poverty trap.  The Government's philosophy is to encourage people to go out to work.  It is saying that if one reduces people's social welfare and allows them get &euro;60 a week more on training and education, that gives them the incentive.  Why not spread that philosophy throughout the system instead of creating disincentives?  I would be broadly supportive of the amendment because it keeps the focus on that aspect.<\/p><p>  On the section, what is proposed is inexplicable to me.  Currently, if a person is in receipt of invalidity pension and they reach age of 65 years, their payment automatically increases to the old pension rate of &euro;230 per week.  This section provides that for the person's 65th year until they reach the age of 66 they will stay on the &euro;193 rate.  In other words, they will get almost &euro;37 per week less.  A person aged 65 in obviously not young and a person in receipt of an invalidity pension is very ill because the medical test to qualify for it is very stringent.  I do not understand this provision to provide a person in that category with &euro;37 per week less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500031#DD00600","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382705400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>It amuses me the frequency with which certain elements in government keep going on about our welfare system and about the need to remove disincentives to work when we know that the vast majority of people on welfare would be better off if they could get a job, even on minimum wages, and all of the evidence supports that.  Those elements in government who keep going on about this issue either do not understand how the system works, refuse to accept the evidence or else are pursuing a particular agenda which is about targeting people on very low incomes.  Certainly, what is being proposed in regard to those under the age of 26 would bear that out, namely, that there is a deliberate policy of making life so difficult and impoverishing people on welfare so much that they will just give up and leave the country.  Those in government should examine the evidence that is there.  There is not an issue about welfare being too high except in the case of rent supplement.  That has been a glaring problem for a number of years and, thankfully, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is in the process of addressing that, and not before time.<\/p><p>  I would like to pick up on the indications from this budget that the left hand has not a clue what the right hand is doing.  Ministers, especially those like the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, are very fond of saying that we need to incentivise people to go back to work.  One of the incentives that was in the system was that the people who were on low incomes, especially families who had a medical card, were allowed to retain that medical card for three years after returning to work.  This applied if they were long-term unemployed.  I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, realises that this measure has been removed from this budget.<\/p><p>Does the Minister of State realise that is the case?

Not only is the Government in the process of removing one of the few incentives for people in long-term unemployment to return to work, but the reply stated that the Department will not seek a refund of the costs of the medical card provided to those who returned and retained access to essential medical services.  This is an outrageous statement.  People who returned to work on the understanding that they would retain their medical card will no longer qualify for the medical card and will be means tested from now on.  I cannot imagine anything more mean-spirited that this measure.  As I indicated, the left hand does not have a clue what the right hand is doing in terms of providing for a sustainable strategy that will ensure people can move out of long-term unemployment and into work.  <\/p><p>  On the substantive issue, the decision to cut the invalidity pension does not make any sense.  It is another example of the Government hammering people on very low incomes.  This time, those affected are at a late stage in their lives, namely, in their mid-60s.  In certain circumstances, couples in which one spouse is in receipt of an invalidity pension and the other is a dependant, will lose in excess of &euro;100 per week.

While this view is not stated explicitly, I believe it is held by certain members of the Fine Gael Party.  However, a cursory examination of the past 25 years will show that it is utter nonsense.<\/p><p>  In the 1980s, the head of the Central Bank made a disgraceful statement about spongers on the dole.  I recall that his remarks caused outrage and led to protests and so forth.  At that time, he could try to make that argument because, as Deputies will recall, the 1980s were characterised by mass, long-term unemployment.  This lie should have been completely nailed, however, when the economy took off and employment became available because people took jobs and unemployment declined to negligible levels.  There is always some unemployment as people need to move between jobs and graduates emerge from college seeking employment.  There is also a tiny number of people, usually consisting of families with deep problems who have been damaged by one or other circumstance, who may be long-term dependants on the social welfare system.  The idea that a majority of people would want to live on the miserable amount of money paid under the social welfare system, with the lack of dignity and so on that this entails, is nonsense.  Nevertheless, a significant section of the Fine Gael Party believes this nonsense.  They should ask why, if that is the case, everybody took jobs when they were available. <\/p><p>   A friend of mine, a skilled tradesman who lost his business in the recession, has been applying for five or six jobs virtually every week.  He informed me that when we went for a job in a warehouse in Sandyford recently, he found that 2,500 others had also applied for it.  It is not the case that people are not seeking work.  The Government is failing to provide employment and is punishing people for losing their jobs and being unable to find another one. <\/p><p>  Having picked on everyone else, why should the Government not pick on 65 year olds?  It attacked the transition pension and will no doubt tell us the purpose of the measure is to rectify an anomaly.

I opposed the change to the State transition pension at the time because it was not logical and forced pensioners of 65 years to apply for the jobseeker's allowance and all that entails.  While the Minister announced that some of the requirements attaching to the jobseeker's allowance will no longer apply to those aged over 62 years, which is a welcome step, she is also proposing to penalise people on the invalidity pension to the tune of &euro;36.80 per week.  Over the year that this supposed anomaly applies, &euro;1,914 will be taken from the pockets of pensioners.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Naughten stated, people paid PRSI on the basis that they would receive a return in the event that they became unemployed or ill.  The invalidity pension is one of a list of benefits.  The State, in changing the invalidity pension and creating a new level of payment, will cut payments to 65 year old disabled pensioners by nearly &euro;2,000 per annum.<\/p><p>  Invalidity pension is paid to people with the requisite contribution record who cannot work due to long-term illness.  The contribution criteria have also changed in recent years.  The current rate of invalidity pension is &euro;193.50 for those aged under 65 years and &euro;230 for those who are 65 years.  This is where the difference lies.  Those who are now aged 64 years will have calculated that they would receive an invalidity pension of &euro;230 per week on reaching 65 years.  The higher rate, which is not, in any case, something to shout about as it will not make anybody rich, is to be discontinued.  As a result, people aged 65 years will no longer enjoy a pension of &euro;230 and will be penalised by receiving a reduced payment.  This measure will apply next year.  <\/p><p>  The Government also plans to increase the pension age to 67 years in, I believe, 2021.  <\/p><p>At that stage, people will have been in limbo for two years.

If one looks at the current expenditure in this area, we are talking about roughly &euro;20 billion, as budgeted for next year.  The total package of adjustments in this area is &euro;290 million, which is approximately 1.5% of the total reduction.  Given the scale of the adjustment made by the previous Government and by this one since 2008, I accept this is a very difficult issue, especially at a time when this country has been hit by an economic tsunami.  Many people depend on these benefits but there is now such a liability on the Social Insurance Fund.  The only way we will see that fund return to surplus in the time ahead is to ensure we get people back to work, which is exactly what we are doing in the measures set out in this Bill and in the other one, and also to ensure the contributions are such to allow us to fulfil those obligations.<\/p><p>  In regard to the proposal colleagues have put forward in terms of a report on this, there is nothing new about that amendment.  Such a proposal has been made before.  To help colleagues who may not have dealt with social welfare legislation in the past, this Bill is basically consolidation legislation.  Effectively, it is an administrative scheme year in, year out built on the changes made and what we can afford in the budget.  It is important to understand that an allocation must be made in terms of how much we can afford, given the circumstances and the economic crisis we face, and how much has to come out of this.  It is consolidation legislation.  The measures we have introduced are broadly based and fair.

I do not have a problem with the proposal to recover benefit from those who have gained compensation.  I have also suggested recovering benefits from the Employment Appeals Tribunal from the companies which lose there.  I hope that in future the Minister will consider that suggestion.  We estimate that a substantial sum of money is lost to the Exchequer in those instances.  I want to ensure that the injured person receives the benefit of the value of any credited contributions assigned to an injured person and that it is not ignored.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 21 covers circumstances where the compensator has already made a reduced award.  There are times when the Department makes mistakes such as a miscalculation of the size of the benefits claimed or received in that period.  The section allows for this but suggests that the State would then return the value of that to the compensator, in this case, the business, rather than to the person who is at a loss, in the hope that the business would transfer it back to that person.  That is the intention of amendment No. 21.  There is not enough time to deal with the technicalities.  If we were sitting in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection I would probably be able to explain this in greater detail, with examples.  Other people want to speak on these matters.<\/p><p>  The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, raised concerns about this in their submission.  I thank it for submitting it despite the short time between the publication of the Bill and this discussion.  When a statement of recoverable benefits is issued, a copy but not the original is sent to the person receiving the benefit and the original goes to the compensator.  Does the compensator have the first right of appeal?  Somebody in possession of the original document has first right of appeal.  That is a practical question.  Does the first right of appeal belong to the social welfare recipient?  The denial of a right of appeal until the Minister has been fully paid is also in breach of fair procedure and needs to be considered.  Cases may arise where there has been a mistake made in the statement, for example, if the Department states that a person was on benefit for four years and was in fact only on benefit for two years.  A certificate arising from such a mistake cannot be appealed, which is also a mistake.  All such decisions should be appealable and those rights are not granted in this instance.

I do not believe that, where the HSE has acted in a grossly ineffective manner which has led to a compensation payment being made to an individual child who has now come of age, the child should be penalised.

Some of those cases have appeared before the courts and have been covered fairly extensively in local and national newspapers.<\/p><p>  On the amendments, the Department will claim from compensators who would normally be insurance companies that portion of the claim which relates to the Department's paying somebody various kinds of benefit such as illness or injury benefit.  This is a standard practice among social security agencies in the rest of Europe.  It should probably have been introduced in Ireland a long time ago.  The principle is that nobody should be compensated twice.  In other cases the compensator, the insurance company, might not reimburse the Department but might in some way or other be the beneficiary of an additional benefit.<\/p><p>  The HSE cases to which the Deputy alluded are very specific and I will not comment on them except to say that at local social welfare offices the staff are very sensitive because there is often a great deal of local knowledge which particularly in the case of child abuse have been the subject of widespread local and national publicity.  These are sensitive family issues and I will not go into them in detail but the Deputy may continue to liaise with me about those cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500035#HH00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382707200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>As the time for this part of the debate has expired, I am required to put the following question in accordance with an order of the D&aacute;il of this day: &quot;That in respect of sections 13 and 14 each section undisposed of is hereby agreed to in Committee.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500035#HH00600","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382707200,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382707800,"counter":503,"content":"<p>SECTION 15<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382707800,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 15 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382707800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I have a number of concerns in respect of section 15.

Do the changes today permit the trustees of an occupational pension scheme to reduce the benefit payable to any person who reaches the age of 65 on or after 1 January 2014?  Will this have a negative impact on these occupational pensions?  I am not clear about this.  This was the point I was trying to raise at the very beginning of the debate today.  Regrettably, the pension age will increase over the next number of years.  It was reduced from 70 between 1973 and 1977 but we are obviously in reverse gear.  It is very important that there is no double disadvantage through a lowering of the occupational pension because there is a presumption of a State pension in the years between 65 and the year in which the person is entitled to the State pension.

Given the shortness of time, I have not managed to get my head around its implications in the two days since it was published.  By the looks of it, other people have not managed to either.  I received an e-mail from the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament which has concerns.  It was advised that it was a technical measure.  The e-mail stated that it would like a strong assurance that no adverse consequences for scheme members would arise as a result of this measure.<\/p><p>  On my reading of it, it seems to suggest that trustees will be able to alter the benefit paid because we are talking about integrated pensions here and most people are not aware of how they work when there is the contributory pension and the private part of it.  If people are not in receipt of the State pension transition, which is the one for the single year, the trustees will be able to reduce the award as if that person was receiving that.  Quite a number of people retire early such as garda&iacute;, teachers and soldiers.  Is there an implication for them with regard to a pension if the trustees decide with the extra powers they now have to reduce the benefit by up to &euro;230 if the person is not in receipt of the State pension transition?  It seems to permit the reduction of the benefit payable to the person who reaches the age of 65 on or after 1 January 2014 as if the State pension transition commenced to be payable to the person from the age of 65.  This is not the ideal way to address that confusion.  Changes to pension provision in this country should be dealt with in a pensions Bill where we have the time to tease it out and the full understanding of what is being proposed rather than it being an afterthought stuck at the back of a social welfare Bill.  I will let the Minister answer and, hopefully, she will be able to set my mind at rest and allay the concerns of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament, which also seems to be concerned about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500036#JJ01000","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1382707800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I agree that it looks a fairly complex measure.  My interpretation of it is that the trustees of a pension scheme are required to take into account the fact that when somebody reaches the age of 65, they are getting a transition pension.  What that means is that they continue paying the person the same pension but reduce it by the amount of the transition pension so in net terms, the person will finish up equal anyway.  With the removal of the transition pension, this allows trustees to act as if the transition pension was still being paid and reduce the amount of the private pension accordingly even though the person is not getting the transition pension anymore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500036#JJ01100","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382707800,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea may recall that his own Government produced key documents in 2007 and 2010.  In the context of changing population age structures in Ireland, the recommendation of those documents and the framework relating to pensions was that the population age be raised to 66.  The Government at the time agreed to that and it became policy.  It also set out the trajectory of the subsequent increases to the higher ages in 2021 and 2028.  That was agreed by that Government.  I think Deputy O'Dea was still a member of that Government so I am sure he will remember it.  This was the context.  When the troika came to Ireland, that was understandably given to it as part of the Fianna F&aacute;il plan and accepted.  The changes in the pension age in Ireland are based on the population age changes and people living longer and having a sustainable contributory retirement pension.  The reforms have improved Ireland's credit rating significantly.  To be clear, what we are talking about is ensuring that trustees can properly administer their schemes.<\/p><p>Being a trustee is a complex and onerous job.  This is a technical amendment designed to address a particular situation where scheme rules state a specific age of 65 years rather the normal pensionable age, which will be 66 years from 1 January 2014.  One can argue that it was always that age under the State pension transition but, following those recommendations, we moved to that policy.  These provisions do not affect the rate of occupational pension promised, which was Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's concern.  Previously schemes operated off the State pension being payable from the age of 65 years.  The amendment is simply intended to ensure this continues to be the case and that members continue to receive the benefits they have been promised.  It ensures that the scheme continues to operate in the manner intended and as understood by and communicated to scheme members.  Both provisions relate to the date of cessation of the bridging pension where the reference to a specific age would provide a bridging pension from ceasing.  In the case of an integrated pension, it will ensure that occupational pensions can continue to reference the State pension in their calculations.<\/p><p> Pension scheme trustees have a fiduciary responsibility under the Pension Act 1990 to administer these schemes properly.  That is a big issue for many trustees.  In the past, trustees tended to be lay volunteers who built up expertise in pensions because they undertook to take on their role on behalf of their co-workers.  Section 59 of the 1990 Act is an overarching provision that sets out the broad duties of trustees and it cannot impede the rules of the scheme from being correctly administered.  The provisions are discretionary and they state clearly that trustees can amend their schemes' rules as appropriate, provided they do so in accordance with the law.  Many schemes set out differing retirement ages, as is their entitlement.  Prior to the crash, a number of banks offered early retirement ages through their schemes.  In the context of an examination of the population numbers and ages in Ireland, the Government of which Deputy O'Dea was a member moved decisively to adjust the State retirement age to 66 years in 2014, 67 years in 2021 and 68 years in 2028.  This change reflects the potential implications for certain trustees.  Rather than stating the State retirement age, they may indicate the age of 65.  The trustees have to be assured they are properly administering their duties on behalf of pensioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102500036#JJ01200","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382708400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

Due to the fall in stock market values which lasted until recently - this year and last year stock market values have begun to increase significantly - pension funds across the western world experienced significant deficits.  This was because of the fall in the stock market but also the turbulence in markets arising from the financial crisis.  Many schemes were built up decades ago based on assumptions about longevity and the profile of members at retirement age.  People in Ireland are living much longer and there is a general move to review pensionable ages.  There was a view of people retiring earlier.  Ten or 15 years ago it was not unusual for people in places like banks to retire at the age of 50 or 55.  That is becoming rare as people move towards longer working lifetimes.  It is up to each scheme to review its position.  In some cases the employer may agree to fund the additional portion.  If it does, it will incur additional liabilities under the scheme.  It is hard to be specific in this regard because each scheme is particular to itself and there are a large number of relatively small schemes in Ireland, as well as a small number of large schemes.<\/p><p>  It is not a question of anybody being reduced.
