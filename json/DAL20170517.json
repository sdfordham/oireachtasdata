Ireland is the 14th most susceptible country to melanoma in the world.  We are very far behind in terms of treatments for advanced or progressive melanoma and a proper national screening programme, which we do not have.  If we had one, it would avoid many of the expensive immunotherapy treatments available.  The problem is that, notwithstanding the very considerable advances that have been made in treatments which can extend life for people with melanoma, particularly advanced melanoma, we are far behind as a country.  The drug, nivolumab, or nivo for short, is one treatment.  In the European Union, only Ireland and Portugal have not approved this drug for reimbursement.<\/p><p>It is an extraordinary situation.<\/p> <p> All EU countries, with the exception of Ireland, France, Italy and Portugal have decided to fund the combination therapy of ipilimumab, known as ipi, and nivolumab, known as nivo.  This combination therapy has proven to be truly radical and transformative in medical research.  Immunotherapy is the new revolution in cancer treatment but we have not approved these particular drugs, notwithstanding the fact they are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and by our own licensing authority, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  Historically, survival rates were very low prior to the arrival of these particular treatments but since these treatments have come on stream, the impact has been quite transformative, particularly for patients with advanced melanoma.  In Ireland, there may be up to 150 patients per year with advanced melanoma, 50% of whom could be suitable for the ipi-nivo combination.<\/p> <p> The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, in the UK is normally one of the slower agencies in this area but it has been one of the quickest out of the traps in approving this particular drug combination because of the data that has emerged.  The most recent and dramatic data has come from the American Association for Cancer Research at its annual meeting in Washington showing positive responses among 60% to 70% of patients.  This is very exciting but we are way behind.  We have not approved nivo or the combination of ipi and nivo.  Professor Carole Longson, the director of health technology at NICE, has said that after one of the fastest drug appraisals carried out by NICE, these promising new immunotherapy treatments for advanced melanoma look set to significantly extend the life of people with the condition.  Dr. James Larkin, a melanoma specialist at the Royal Marsden hospital was one of the leaders in a ground-breaking clinical trial of the combination therapy and 60% of his patients responded well to it.<\/p> <p> I do not know why we are so slow in this area.  I have been pointing out for more than two years that our system is not working.  Since the enactment of the 2013 Act, it most certainly is not working and many patients are being left behind in respect of ground breaking treatments that can prolong their lives and lead to significant remission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495019100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Martin that the system we have had here for many years is not up to speed in the context of major new drugs that are approved by the FDA and similar authorities.  Furthermore, being a small country, we do not have the financial reach to be able to provide for all new drugs that come on stream very quickly.  The case made by the Deputy about melanoma is one of many such cases.  I received a letter from a major pharmaceutical company recently about a number of drugs that are produced by the company that are not used in Ireland but which are exported around the world.<\/p>  <p>  The recent situation in respect of Orkambi is instructive here.  Orkambi is exceptionally expensive, for very good reasons.  In that context, we had international collaboration looking at the whole question of the priorities attached to drugs, how they should be funded and the relevant costs that should apply.  Rather than proceeding alone, as one country, this is the way to go in the future.  In collaboration with a number of other countries, significant reductions were brought about in the cost of that particular drug, together with an analysis of the improvement in the quality of life that the drug would actually provide for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  <\/p>  <p>  The process in respect of melanoma is under way in the HSE and the relevant agencies.  The point Deputy Martin makes is that we are not in a position to provide ultra modern drugs that come on the scene which clearly bring about serious improvements in the lives of patients suffering from various ailments.  I was struck by the fact that no sooner was the decision made, money provided and an agreement reached for Orkambi, another 35 to 40 new drugs were being named as coming on stream for different ailments, many of which were also very expensive. <\/p><p>We need to look nationally at the scale of what we provide for drug purchase in respect of a range of ailments, and internationally at whether we can collaborate with other countries on the purchase of modern drugs for specialised ailments, including various forms of cancer.  Perhaps that is the way to go.  I am quite sure there is a measure of agreement across the House on these matters.  As the Deputy is aware, we do not have an endless pit of money.  I think we can improve the way we deal with the provision of drugs, thereby leaving aside the priority attached to the drugs for which we can actually provide money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700004#B00200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495019400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>There was a time when we were far more ahead of the curve in approving new technologies and treatments.  We have fallen well behind in recent years.  These approvals often get caught up in the system.  This does not happen because of cost grounds initially.  There is a suspicion that this might be the underlying reason, but it is never stated.  There is significant evidence here.  Why are Ireland and Portugal the only EU countries that do not approve nivo on its own?  The combination of ipi and nivo is captivating cancer researchers around the world, particularly those involved in skin cancer research.  The US Food and Drug Administration approved this combination in 2015 under an accelerated approval programme because the results showed rapid and deep regressions of patient tumours.  These dramatic results captivated doctors and patients alike.  People in Ireland need this treatment at the moment.  Medical oncologists have told me that people in Ireland who have the resources to do so are paying &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 for this treatment.  People who do not have such resources are considering whether they should sell their houses or take other steps to get access to the ipi-nivo combination.  This is a real issue.  Approximately 50% of the 150 people in this country who are diagnosed with advanced melanoma each year would be eligible for this treatment.  This should be doable.  In my view, something is not right somewhere in our system.  We are way behind the curve when compared with other countries that are well advanced in approving radical breakthrough treatments for forms of cancer that were not treatable in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1495019400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The advances made over the years in medicine generally and in particular ailments have been astounding.  The pipeline of new drugs coming on stream has simply exploded because of the research, the innovation and the work that is going into precise and specific elements for which drugs are now produced.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 sets out the legal and statutory process in this regard.  The HSE makes the decisions here.  We are awaiting a decision in the case of the melanoma drugs mentioned by the Deputy.  As he has pointed out, responsibility for such decisions has been transferred from those involved in the political process to those involved in the quality-of-life process who have the clinical excellence and so on.  There has been an explosion in the number of new drugs coming through the pipeline.  Now that the Orkambi case has been settled, we are awaiting the provision of finance to provide between 30 and 40 new drugs to patients with particular ailments.  The Minister for Health travelled to Malta earlier this month to sign the Valletta declaration, under which Ireland and seven other countries have agreed to work together on procuring, deciding on priorities and bringing about cost reductions so that more patients will be able to access new and specific drugs.  I am sure that any Minister for Health would like to be able to say that as new drugs for particular chronic ailments, including melanomas, come on stream and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, he or she will be in a position to provide for those drugs.  Even though cost reductions have been secured in the case of Orkambi for a very good cause - cystic fibrosis patients - I understand it is the most expensive drug in this country's history.  The Minister and the Department are aware of this issue.  I think that by bringing about international collaboration between the countries that have signed up to the Valletta declaration on joint procurement, we will bring about an improvement in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700005#C00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1495019400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We are way behind on melanoma.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700005#C00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1495019400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The assessment for the two melanoma drugs mentioned by the Deputy is under way with the HSE.<\/p><p>The Minister can give the Deputy more precise details of the work involved in or the point of that assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700005#C00500","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495019700,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Joe and his family were known to the Health Service Executive child and family services since he was a young child.  There was a history of domestic violence and alcohol abuse in the family home.  He had been listed by Tusla as a high priority case and, sadly, took his own life at the age of 15 years.  Despite the fact that he had been identified as a high priority case, he had not been allocated a social worker because of staff shortages.<\/p>  <p>  Dylan was in the care of the State after leaving the care of his mother who was struggling with a drug problem.  He died just before his 17th birthday, with a high level of toxicity in his system.  A recent review of the case by the national review panel found that issues with his welfare had been known about for long periods, that a succession of social workers had been involved but never for long enough to develop a relationship and that a child protection plan had been made but never implemented.<\/p>  <p>  Avril's family background was described as being categorised by domestic violence, criminality and changes of accommodation.  She had been out of contact with the social work department for nearly two years when she died, not fully 17 years old, with her case closed.<\/p>  <p>  These cases, among others, were examined by the national review panel which found systemic failures by Tusla and the social services.  In each instance it emphasised that no specific action or inaction by social workers had been responsible for the deaths but, it found time and again failures that could be attributed to a high turnover of social workers and pressures of work which had led to fire fighting.  These cases underline a system that is broken and that stretches resources too thinly, including social workers who are doing their best but who are utterly overworked, exhausted and overwhelmed.  Efforts to resolve the issue are falling far short.  Tusla is losing 150 social workers a year.  Despite efforts to recruit, the net increase in the number of the child and family social workers in 2016 was a mere 56.  There are three times as many child and family social workers in the North per head of population as in the South.  Best practice internationally suggests social workers should have a caseload of approximately 15, but I have come across social workers who are dealing with 26 and more and that is not to mention the unallocated cases, of which there are 5,720.  Of these, there are 1,057 high priority cases.  There are 1,000 Joes, 1,000 Avrils and 1,000 Dylans who are at risk as we debate the issue here.

There are more and more pieces of information coming to light on challenges for various families and children throughout the country and social workers are under pressure to deal with all the cases with which they have to deal.  Arising from the incidence of domestic violence cases, quite a number of initiatives have been taken to enable such incidents to be dealt with and, where possible, prevented but where they do happen the children involved should be catered for properly.

Having gone through two rounds of public sector pay talks, I reiterate my view that this is very late in the day.  Of course, I wish the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, well in his negotiations.  A fair deal that recognises the sacrifices made by public servants over recent years would be very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  In the course of the forthcoming talks, the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, will head the trade union side.  I welcome the fact the Garda and the Defence Forces associations have also been invited to attend.  Today I focus on the broader issue of trade union recognition for both of these groups.  The Taoiseach previously committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Unfortunately, although the commitment was given last November, we still have not even seen the heads of the Bill that would bring this about.  To date, the Taoiseach has explicitly ruled out making any similar commitment on the Defence Forces, although he could make that as Minister for Defence.<\/p>  <p>  Since the formation of this Government a year ago, the Taoiseach is one of the Ministers who has failed to enact any legislation relating to his brief.  He may not have time to see through a Bill now, given the changing political circumstances, but even signalling his support for such a change would be really important.  There are approximately 13,000 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 10,000 active personnel in our Defence Forces.  These people carry out some of the most dangerous public sector roles in this country but they have no entitlement to access even the basic industrial relations machinery of the State.  We all know issues must be carefully dealt with and agreements must be made relating to the right to strike or take industrial action that would put public safety at risk.  These matters are well versed and rehearsed elsewhere.  Allowing garda&iacute; and those in the Defence Forces to affiliate to ICTU would be a welcome step, as would giving them full access to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Making them full partners rather than merely attendees at public sector pay talks would be even more important.<\/p>  <p>  At a time when morale within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is terribly damaged, this would be a good time for the Taoiseach to act.

A commitment was given that the legislation would be put in place before the end of this year and that commitment stands and will be followed through.  <\/p>  <p>  On 20 December last the Government approved the preparation of the heads of a Bill to provide the associations with access to the WRC and to the Labour Court.  In addition to the technical legislative change required to provide access, the Government decision noted that some very significant issues will fall to be considered, including the status of the Garda associations established under An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts and the related question of the constraints upon members of taking industrial action.  Do we want a situation where members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na go on strike?  Providing access to the WRC and the Labour Court does not of itself imply the removal of either the prohibition on members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na joining trade unions or the constraints on industrial action.  To assist in the consideration of these and some ancillary issues a working group chaired by Mr. John Murphy, the recently retired Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been established.  The working group is considering some of the technical and practical issues that will arise and it is drawing on the experience and expertise of the relevant Departments and bodies of the group.  The working group has identified several key issues that will require consideration.  These include whether the associations should become full trade unions, the question of constraints on industrial action, the range of matters on which access is to be provided to the WRC and the Labour Court, what internal processes are to be put in place and be exhausted prior to issues being brought to the WRC - and that is part now of the structural work the commission announced yesterday and which it will also consider in terms of the workings of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - how industrial relations should operate within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and when access to the WRC and the Labour Court has been provided.

We know the contribution they made to the community and I want it to be recognised.  This could be done simply and without huge cost to the State by recognising the years spent out of work and granting the women concerned eligibility for a pension in retirement.

In that regard, it is important for Ministers to tell the truth and refrain from engaging in fake news about specific issues.  I refer, in particular, to the social welfare budget.  Recently, a campaign on welfare cheats was launched by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, setting out the big figure of &euro;500 million which could be gained from tackling fraud.  Deputy Willie O'Dea tabled a parliamentary question, to which we received a comprehensive reply yesterday setting out, lo and behold, that only &euro;41 million in payments was attributable to fraud.  Social welfare inspectors conduct face-to-face interviews and desktop reviews through which they discern the level of fraud.  In this instance, the nation has been the victim of an extraordinary degree of fake news.  The subtext of the Department and the Minister sponsoring an expensive media advertising campaign to tell untruths and brand welfare recipients in general - that is the most serious issue - appears to be about creating the impression that there is welfare fraud involving hundreds of millions which the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is going to get because he wants to be leader.  For those in receipt of social welfare payments, it is not good enough and does not speak to the just and fair society and the creation of a social economy as articulated in chapter 3 of the programme for Government.

Some 7,500 people currently live in emergency accommodation.  One in every three homeless persons is a child.  Rents are at record levels.  Home ownership is beyond the reach of many on average incomes.  At the very heart of these problems is the availability and cost of land.  The high cost of land in Ireland drives costs of rents, business leases, house prices and infrastructure investment.  High land prices encourage speculation and land hoarding.  In turn, these practices lead to excessive land vacancy, inefficient land use, dereliction and problematic sites that often invite anti-social behaviour.<\/p><p>Yet, the political and administrative institutions of our country remain largely passive on this key issue.  The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 introduced a vacant site levy but left us with several loopholes and allowed for very slow implementation.  This Bill seeks to amend the 2015 Act.  Its central aim is to make more land available so that more housing can be developed and so the cost of land and housing can be moderated.  It has four main purposes.<\/p><p>It seeks to apply the vacant site levy to all lands that can potentially accommodate housing within existing development standards.  The current Act sets a limit of 0.05 hectares or 500 sq. m, meaning the levy cannot be applied to vacant sites smaller than this.  Therefore, there is no activation of these sites.  They are not considered a priority.  This excludes many sites that could readily accommodate residential units.  Some 174 sites were excluded from the Dublin City Council vacant site register on this basis alone.  The new provision would allow the levy to be applied to sites of an area that, in the opinion of the planning authority, could accommodate housing units and still meet development standards.<\/p><p> The second provision is to ensure the rate of the levy will be increased the longer the site remains vacant.  Currently, the 3% levy applies, regardless of how long a site has been vacant.  However, this will not deal with landowners who are hoarding or speculating if the rate of land price inflation is high.  There will be very little incentive for such landowners to sell or develop the site in question.  We propose that the levy be increased by one percentage point for every full year a site remains on the register.  In this way, the longer it remains vacant, the larger the levy that will apply.  It will create a significant incentive for the owner to activate it.  <\/p> <p> The third provision is to remove the lower rates of levy applying to sites with outstanding loans.  In the bands set down by the 2015 Act the higher the loan attached to a vacant site the lower the levy that applies.  We believe this provision invites deliberate manipulation of the legislation, incentivises debt and excludes a significant number of sites from the scope of the Act.  It unfairly prioritises the rights of the landowner over the public good.  We, therefore, propose to repeal these provisions.<\/p> <p> The final provision is to require the zoning and area of each site to be published on the vacant site register.  This will provide better information and for greater transparency and improve the usability of the register.<\/p> <p> The Government must take several measures to deal with the critical housing shortage.  It should be much more active on over-the-shop premises, vacant housing, derelict sites and underused housing.  The Bill is just one measure the Social Democrats proposes to deal with the crisis.  We commend the Bill to the House and would be grateful to receive the support of Deputies on all sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700016#O00900","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495025100,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1495025100,"counter":128,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495025100,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1495025100,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1495025100,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495025100,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1495025100,"counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1495025100,"counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P00800"},{"type":"question","time":1495025100,"counter":135,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[23026\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health last met; and when it is next due to meet.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1495025100,"counter":136,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[23041\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the next meeting of the Cabinet committee on health will be held.","asker":"1432","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1495025100,"counter":137,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[23047\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on health last met; and when it next plans to meet.","asker":"1353","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1495025100,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.

I note that a future leader has suggested the same, that when he gets in, he will take charge of it also.  There are about 666,000 patients on inpatient and outpatient waiting lists.  There are record high waiting lists.  Children are waiting for more than a year for access to elective surgery.  The Cabinet committee on health which the Taoiseach has chaired for many years failed on the compulsory health insurance plan.  The Taoiseach spoke about removing the HSE, but he was not in a position to do so.  It was a broken promise.  He got rid of the board and made a mess of governance.  The crisis in the health service is quite shocking.  When the Taoiseach looks back on it, does he accept that the Cabinet committee on health has failed abysmally to tackle the issues arising in the health service, particularly in providing access to treatments for many patients?  He has been unlucky with the Ministers he appointed.  The former Minister, former Deputy James Reilly, ended up in trouble because of the absence of blueprints behind ideas that had been floated.  The former Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, now Minister for Social Protection, ran out of the Department as quickly as he could get into it and was determined to be a commentator, rather than a doer.  Apparently, if one looks at the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan's WhatsApp group, it seems the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, wants to do the same.  He is also in a hurry to get out.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach indicated to me what can be pulled from the wreckage in developing a coherent reality-based health policy and how the Cabinet committee can become far more effective than it has been for the past few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700017#P01500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1495025100,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The role of the Cabinet committee is not to run services for the Department of Health or the HSE but to provide a basis for political oversight in the development and delivery of key health service reforms in line with the commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government and to drive improvements in selected areas.  It maintains oversight of the most significant areas of the health service.  In the case of the winter initiative, it provided &euro;40 million in additional funding for preparation for issues that would arise.  A significant focus was placed on reducing the numbers of delayed discharges in acute hospitals through the funding and provision of additional home care packages, additional home help hours and additional transitional care beds.  The number of delayed discharges was reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December 2016.  It was maintained below 500 from mid-December through to the end of February.  Obviously, there were staffing challenges.  A significant issue last winter was the day-to-day maintenance of staffing levels and the ability to flex staffing levels to meet open surge capacity, in other words, at times when there was a spike in the numbers of patients coming through emergency departments.  The figures released by the National Treatment Purchase Fund on Friday, 7 April confirmed that there were 84,838 patients on inpatient or day case procedure waiting lists; 18,000 waiting for a routine GI endoscopy procedure; and 466,000 waiting for a first outpatient appointment.

The Taoiseach has given various figures and made reference to them being on-profile or over-profile but in truth the tracking of expenditure has been extremely difficult in the last few years.  In the last number of years, the HSE has been on target, more or less, until around November but some miraculous thing happens in the last few weeks of the year and the executive requires an additional &euro;500 million, &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million to balance the books.

Last night in my own constituency, there were 26 patients on trolleys in Cork University Hospital and 16 in the Mercy University Hospital.  Even well out from winter, the numbers on trolleys remain very high despite the best efforts of health care staff and overworked nurses and doctors.  This is evidence of a system that is completely and utterly dysfunctional.  Whatever action the Government has taken has failed to make a significant dent in the problem.  The trolley crisis is a symptom of a health system in crisis, as is the shocking rise in public waiting lists for treatment.  There is now a record of well in excess of 660,000 patients on waiting lists for some kind of hospital care.  The &euro;50 million sticking plaster that the Government is spending on initiatives to cut waiting lists is having no appreciable effect.  In the days, weeks or months left to him in office, will the Taoiseach establish an emergency department task force on a permanent basis to deal with the crisis at hand?  Will he also agree to increase the number of hospital beds, nursing home beds, home help hours and invest in community services?

Emergency department overcrowding and long patient waiting lists are of critical concern here.  Last September the HSE's winter initiative was announced which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding to deal with these matters.  A range of practical measures to address emergency department overcrowding were implemented, including 90 newly-opened additional hospital beds and a reduction in delayed discharges nationally from 668 in September to 434 in December.  Delayed discharges were maintained below 500 to the end of February.  Aids and appliances were given to over 4,450 patients, 1,000 additional home care packages were provided and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals were also made.  All these measures enabled patients to be discharged from hospital sooner.  A key element of the winter initiative was for the HSE to work with hospitals to develop improvement actions and winter plans at each location.  Learning from the most recent winter initiative will be important for the future.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing measures to relieve pressure in emergency departments, several major capital projects are under way or in the process of completion which will increase overall capacity in the hospital system.  These include a new ward block and an adult mental health unit at University Hospital Galway, a new emergency department in Limerick and an extension at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The Department has also commenced a bed capacity review in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  That review will feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme which is under way at present.  The Minister and the Department will continue to work intensively with the HSE to address the challenges and monitor the performance in the emergency departments.  In Deputy Howlin's constituency in Wexford, for example, the design and construction of the new emergency department has eliminated a great deal of the pressure and stress in what was previously a very constrained and confined emergency department.  A number of modular units will be put in place as extensions to existing emergency departments in some hospitals to relieve pressure.  Members are aware that the population of this country is ageing.  We must think in terms of 2020, 2030 and even 2040.  By 2040 Ireland may have 1 million additional people and will need 0.5 million extra houses.  We will also have to deal with our ageing population in the context of hospital locations, primary care centres, community homes and so forth.

What has actually been discussed in delivering on Creative Ireland?  It is difficult to see what might be delivered with the miserable &euro;5 million dedicated to this initiative.  What is actually happening with the commitment to community arts?  We were told that every child would have an opportunity to express himself or herself creatively.  What exactly is happening with the pilot scheme for self-employed artists in receipt of jobseeker's allowance?  It has been talked about, but there is no sign of anything being rolled out.  Artists face difficulties when they are expected to show that they have been looking for work, but the arts do not work like that.  The Government recognised that some scheme was needed.  Ministers spoke about establishing a pilot scheme to accommodate the needs of artists, but there is no sign of such a scheme.  In the light of its verbal and rhetorical commitment to the arts, has the Government started to consider whether it will provide for a serious increase in the allocation for the arts in the forthcoming budget?  I remind the House that this country is at the bottom of the league table for GDP expenditure on the arts.  Has the Government discussed this?

Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to the Creative Ireland document which was published by the Government last December.  It includes a proposal that was included in the Labour Party's manifesto in last year's general election.  I am glad that the Government has embraced this good idea which involves the establishment of a scheme to help self-employed artists.

The report also highlights the ambition and steps to improve services for families, children, people with disabilities and mental health problems, older people, including key reforms necessary in the health and justice sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Significant work has also been undertaken in advance of and following the UK's referendum on EU membership to ensure an effective whole of government approach to the Brexit negotiations that takes full account of the Government's negotiating priorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to implement its programme, striking a balance between addressing urgent priorities and engaging in long-term planning so that lasting solutions are implemented to secure a strong economy and a fair society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700020#S01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1495026900,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Question No. 7 in the name of Deputy Gerry Adams is being taken by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700020#S01800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1495026900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach will know, there was much in the programme for Government, to which Sinn F&eacute;in objected from the outset, but, even by this Government's standards and its own brand of politics, its first year has been a failure.

I also have my own view on the confidence and supply agreement with the Government's loyal opposition.  The reality is that this so-called new politics is not new.  It is the same old, same old.  Consequently, there is a deep paralysis in the body politic.  Whether that is due to the Taoiseach deciding when or where he is going, and perhaps we will learn more of that later on, or the desire of Fianna F&aacute;il to keep the minority Government weak and not to allow it any real successes, the result is that this Government is staggering from one crisis to another.<\/p>  <p>  I dealt earlier with the Government's failure to provide social supports for children at risk and with respect to the health service.  I want to touch briefly on the issues of housing and homelessness.  There are now 15 vacant properties for every homeless person in Cork.  A total of 295 people accessed a shelter in Cork in one week in March.  The incidence of homelessness is up 20% since the Minister took office.  His 1 July deadline that no homeless families will be living in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation is looming and we have yet to see any detail of how he intends to achieve that.  Social housing delivery is being exaggerated and is moving at a snail's pace.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Government's first year has been a failure.  If the Taoiseach is honest with himself, he will accept that the first year of his Government has not been marked by success but by crisis, particularly in the areas of health and housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700020#S01900","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1495026900,"counter":206,"content":"<p>While Simon and Leo battle it out to succeed the Taoiseach-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700020#S02100","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1495026900,"counter":207,"content":"<p>There might be another one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700020#S02200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1495026900,"counter":208,"content":"<p>-----and there might be a dark horse or two - God knows - the programme for Government commitments in the area that is most urgent for the citizens of this country are failing disastrously.  The Taoiseach might say to Simon and Leo that they are to keep the campaign short and deal with this housing crisis, which the Taoiseach has helped create.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask a number of specific questions about the Taoiseach's programme for Government commitments.  First, the very first line of the programme's chapter on housing refers to \"affordable\".  There is no affordable scheme.  There is no affordable rental scheme mentioned in the programme and no affordable housing scheme mentioned in Rebuilding Ireland.  Even though these form centre pieces of Rebuilding Ireland, there is not a sign of these schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the programme refers in great detail to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and its central role in delivering.  Deputy Simon Coveney confirmed something yesterday, which every TD in this D&aacute;il knows, that the figures are shocking and revealing.  In Dublin, average rents for a two-bedroom house are now &euro;2,600 a month whereas the HAP rent support is &euro;1,250 a month for the same sized accommodation.  In other words, average rents are more than twice what the Government is willing to give people in HAP support to find accommodation.  Needless to say, they cannot find it and they end up homeless.  What will the Taoiseach do to bridge that gap?  Currently, it is simply a recipe for spiralling homelessness, which is shocking and obscene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700020#S02300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1495027500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I do not pretend to be objective in doing an analysis of the Government's first year but many people, even the most objective of them, would not say it has been a productive year either for this D&aacute;il or the Government because of the nature of this D&aacute;il.  Bluntly, the Taoiseach knows and I am sure he would admit it privately that senior officials in Departments are not bringing matters to Ministers or the Cabinet, unless they are absolutely essential.  This is not only because of a fear they will not get through the Oireachtas without amendments they do not want but because they are not even sure they will get them through the Cabinet.  We can survive on that for a while but it cannot go on for too long.  There are too many extraordinarily big issues to be addressed, including some of the social issues referenced by other Deputies, such as housing, health, etc.  We must also consider the fundamental external threats to our well-being, such as Brexit and the economic policies of the US President.<\/p>  <p>  I will ask a question of one aspect of the Government's agenda and trumpeted in its progress report, which is the reform agenda.  Despite what is in the agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il, not a single piece of Opposition legislation has been enacted from 140 pieces of legislation.  There is a pretence that all Deputies in the House can bring forward legislation and advance it.  We had the difficulty with the money messages which I think has been resolved, certainly with regard to a number of Bills of which I am aware.  Is there a commitment to genuinely progress proposals which are fit for purpose, are crafted well and might need minor amendment?  I heard what the Taoiseach said to Deputy O'Dea earlier.  Will such Bills be allowed to proceed to enactment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700021#T00100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1495027500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I will put some perspective on what has just been said.

One obvious response in finding out whether a proposal can make it through the D&aacute;il is to undertake some consultation with people.  That has not happened.  One cannot blame the D&aacute;il for the fact that legislation has not come forward.  We asked yesterday about the Technological Universities Bill, which has not come near the D&aacute;il.  There have been external discussions with trade unions but it has not come near the D&aacute;il.  There is not much in it and there may be some disagreement - the word \"shall\" might become \"may\" in one section - but there is no reason for that to hang around for 12 months.  The schools admissions Bill has been hanging around and a range of Bills could be dealt with if Ministers became more proactive.  The bulk of the legislative programme is non-contentious but some of the commentariat have only been too willing to fall for the camouflage.  The D&aacute;il is not stopping Ministers from coming forward with legislation.  They can do it if they wish and be more proactive.  I do not know if the Taoiseach has sought from Ministers a list of legislation that could be published or which might be published if they knew what the reaction would be.

Due to the fact that their qualification is external to the Air Corps it is not recognised by it because they are not officers.  There is a particular problem within the air force, common to many other air forces around the world, in that the officer class does not recognise those of a lower grade under its terms.

The use of the language \"as available\" is unacceptable and inadequate and it needs to be revised.  The service should not be provided as available, but should be a mandatory obligation to citizens.  Just as ministerial transport is now considered mandatory as one of the four priorities, air ambulance transfer and top cover should be mandatory.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Defence must listen when it is warned about difficulties in staffing and not always be reactionary.  The Department should be ahead of the curve in identifying potential risks.  It should not wait until it becomes a crisis and we lose lives before it reacts.  That is what the Department is doing.  It is moving from crisis to crisis and reacting all the time.  It is never preventing a tragedy.  We need to get ahead of the game rather than to be always chasing our tails.  I ask the Minister of State directly to ensure that air ambulance hospital transfer and search and rescue top cover are made priorities for the Department of Defence.  They should not be provided on an as-available basis but on foot of a mandatory Air Corps obligation to provide those services to our citizens, which is what they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700024#W00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1495029300,"counter":280,"content":"<p>This has been a long-standing tradition of service-level agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700024#W00400","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1495029300,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700024#W00500","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1495029300,"counter":282,"content":"<p>It is a situation which obtained prior to me coming into this office, prior to the time of Deputy Coveney and prior to the time of the previous Minister, Alan Shatter.

As a result, new terms and conditions were introduced for enlisted personnel enlisting after 1994.  Post-January 1994, soldiers have different upper service limits or age limits depending on rank at discharge date and whether they are in a line or technician class.

To this end, the SFPA has a service level agreement with the Department of Defence.  This is intended to ensure efficient enforcement of sea-fisheries law at sea through the support provided by the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  In accordance with this agreement, an annual control plan is agreed between the parties.  This sets out the strategy for achieving sea-fisheries control targets each year.  The Naval Service is also responsible for the operation of the fisheries monitoring centre, which is located at the naval base in Haulbowline and is operated by the Naval Service on a 24-7 basis. <\/p><p>The consequences of Brexit will depend on the manner in which, and under what circumstances, the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.

My understanding from talking to naval officers and others is that the current system is very hard to police.  It is very hard to police certain fleets of other nations.  The best case example might be New Zealand or other countries where they shut down large areas.  The benefit of that is to fisheries.  Another benefit is that the small inshore fleet might begin to have a viable future.  Also, we could take some of the analysis that was done in Galway Bay, SmartBay, and do it as a major research project out in the Atlantic.  The scale of ambition I am talking about is in terms of very big marine conservation areas that are rigorously policed and scientifically analysed.  That is where the opportunity lies.  I am not too sure if the four vessels we have procured, among them the <i>LE William Butler Yeats<\/i>, the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, the <i>LE James Joyce<\/i>, are necessarily well commissioned for that sort of scientific work.

The Air Corps continues to provide a broad range of services on a daily basis in accordance with its primary security roles, including Army and Naval Service supports, maritime patrols and fishery protection and supports in aid to the civil power, such as operation of the Garda helicopters and fixed-wing fleet.  In 2016, as with all other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps responded to 100% of requests for aid to the civil power, comprising 1,350 separate missions, and carried out 297 separate maritime patrol missions in support of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Air Corps continues to undertake a diverse range of non-security-related tasks, such as providing the emergency aeromedical support service, in addition to inter-hospital transfers and search and rescue supports, which are provided in accordance with relevant service level agreements.  Its involvement in the response to the recent gorse fires further exemplifies its utility.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of funding, budget 2017 provided an additional &euro;7 million in capital funding for the overall defence Vote and the updated capital provision for the years 2017 to 2021 now means that there is a capital provision of &euro;406 million available over the current five-year period.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that the Air Corps Cessna fleet is to be replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance tasks.  In this regard, earlier this month my Department initiated a tender competition for these aircraft.  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the two Air Corps CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft, with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft that would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo-carrying tasks.  In addition, last year my Department placed a contract for a Pilatus PC-9M aircraft to replace the aircraft that was written off following the tragic accident that occurred in 2009, and this aircraft is scheduled for delivery this year at a cost of &euro;5 million plus VAT.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the range of measures and initiatives being taken will enhance the resources available to the Air Corps and help to ensure that the Defence Forces can continue to fulfil all roles assigned by the Government in the White Paper on defence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700027#Z00700","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1495031100,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

There have been serious indications that the drug can cause the risk of mental health problems.  It is a huge issue.  Last year, the British Ministry of Defence acknowledged that 1,000 ex-servicemen and women are suffering severe psychiatric and mental health problems as a result of being prescribed Lariam.

I am supportive of initiatives beyond the traditional recruitment processes to fill skill gaps in this context.  Facilitating a return to service by former members of the Defence Forces is one such initiative.  Former members offer the twin advantages of expertise and familiarity with the military.  Previously, individual requests have been dealt with on a bespoke needs basis, given the relatively low number of such applications.  The applications were at officer level.

This is a hugely important issue in my town, the area around Drogheda and the whole county.  The latest census of population shows that Drogheda is now the biggest town in the country outside the major cities.  The difference in population between Waterford city and Drogheda is less than 7,000, yet we have no proper local council and no local control, although there has been a huge influx of new citizens into the town.  We have a huge need for housing and local infrastructure.  We need the confidence of the people to be expressed through local democracy.  The reforms which took place are not working.  Power has moved from the borough council to the county council.  That is no reflection on any of the wonderful officials who work in the county council, but it is a huge reflection on the lack of accountability and local control.  We need control over planning and road infrastructure.  We also need to invest more in town estates in the provision of footpaths and green spaces.  We need more sports centres.  Every single penny collected in property tax in Drogheda and district should be spent locally.  Change is needed and it is happening, but there must be local control.  That is the key point.  <\/p>  <p>  In its wisdom, the county council recently decided to spend &euro;12 million on new local government offices in Drogheda.  That money could be much better spent on infrastructure to improve estates and sports facilities.  The town is crying out for investment and support.  We have no IDA Ireland and no Enterprise Ireland office and no institute of technology.  This week we have been told we are losing the Millmount development centre.  Small as it is, it has the capacity to provide 24 hot desks for people who want to create their own businesses.  Giving Drogheda city status is long overdue.  It looks like, however, that we will not have a driving test centre, as I proposed some time ago, as there is some local political opposition to the site on which I thought we could work.  We also have no local employment office.  Decisions are made by people who do not live and work in Drogheda.  I accept that the Minister is not in the job long and did not introduce the last item of legislation.  It was introduced by another Government which we both supported.  It was, however, wrong and does not work.  We want local control and want it now.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak for four minutes.  The last time I spoke I was shut down because there was another Deputy who wanted to speak also.  Narrow West Street in Drogheda is disintegrating and falling down.  It is as if a bomb struck it.  The town centre is dying because planning permission was given for out-of-town shopping centres, some of which are in the adjoining county.  We need a rates base in Drogheda and to change the way things are done.  A commission was set up to look at extending the borough boundaries, but the Minister had no influence on the decision.  The recommendation was against increasing the capacity to govern locally.  It was not a bad decision made by the Minister but a bad recommendation.  Local government is not working and people are losing out.  Everywhere I go they want to know what is being done and changing.  Nothing is changing, apart from the population is getting bigger and demands are growing.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700031#DD00800","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1495033500,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Local government areas are specified in primary legislation.  Section 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 states the State is divided into local government areas known counties and cities and cities and counties.  The Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provides for three cities - Cork, Dublin and Galway - and for each of them to have a city council.  If an additional city council were to be established in law, it would have significant implications for the county in which the area concerned was situated, particularly with regard to the loss of functions of the relevant county council.  This would, in fact, be the reverse of actions taken under the Local Government Reform Act 2014 which saw the integration of two existing city councils, Limerick and Waterford, with populations of 87,000 and 47,000, respectively, into two new stronger and better resourced city and county councils.  In both cases, the description \"city\" continues to apply to their status as major urban centres.  That status is in no way diminished by the fact that they no longer have separate local authorities.  On the contrary, all of the indications are that both have progressed significantly in the past few years, not least in terms of economic activity.  If Drogheda were to be considered for such a fundamental change in local government arrangements, as suggested in the Topical Issue, it would have wide-ranging implications not only for Louth County Council but also for Meath County Council.  While a rigorous examination would be needed if a proposal to upgrade to city status was contemplated by the Government, it is possible to identify likely implications at a broad level, including, legal, financial, organisational and possibly electoral consequences, all of which would require careful and detailed analysis.  <\/p>  <p>  The town of Drogheda has recently been the subject of a local authority boundary review, as the Deputy mentioned.  In June 2015 an independent statutory committee was appointed to carry out a review of local government boundaries in Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford.  In each case the committee was asked to carry out a review of the boundary between the respective local authorities and make recommendations with respect to those boundaries and any consequential matter it considered necessary in the interests of effective local government.  The main rationale for undertaking the boundary reviews is that in each case there is a significant overspill of population into another county based on the population figures taken from the 2011 census.  In the case of Drogheda, the town has expanded significantly into County Meath, with a population of nearly 6,000 reported as being located in County Meath in the 2011 census, which represents nearly 16% of the total population of the town and environs of 38,578.  The report of the Drogheda boundary committee was submitted on 16 February 2017 and did not recommend, as the Deputy said, an extension of the boundary.<\/p>  <p>  I have been to Drogheda a number of times and I am more than aware of the pressures on the town and the pace at which the population is growing and the need for both local and national government to respond to that pace of growth through the provision of social, community and quality of life infrastructure.  Part of it has to involve good local governance.  We have looked and are continuing to look at restructuring local government in Cork, Galway, Waterford and south Kilkenny.  During these processes we will learn lessons and find better ways to govern in areas that have more than one boundary.<\/p><p>We also need to learn lessons in the context of the continued growth of Drogheda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700031#DD00900","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495034100,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the issues relating to Drogheda and its environs.  The fact is that Drogheda was turned down by the independent commission but that commission was absolutely wrong.  Drogheda had a borough council from 1169 until its abolition in recent times.  We need to get that council back and to have local control.  Local debates would previously have taken place at borough council meetings, attended by local authority management and the public but that has all gone.  There is no local debate now.  Indeed, there is no local council, full stop and that is where the reforms were absolutely wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should restore a council to the town of Drogheda and its environs, with real power and real accountability.  Longford has a population of approximately 40,000.  It has a county manager and all of the infrastructure necessary for a county council but it has a smaller population than the town of Drogheda.  Leitrim has a population of only 30,000 and yet it has the infrastructure that Drogheda so badly needs.  Huge decisions must be made here.  There is enough work in Drogheda and its environs to keep a full-time manager busy, 24\/7 and that is what the people want.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has said that he is looking at a number of issues relating to other cities and towns.  He called Kilkenny a city but it only has a population of about 25,000.  There are 15,000 more people living in the town of Drogheda than in Kilkenny.  While I appreciate it does not have its own city council, Kilkenny derives a certain amount of status from being called a city.  We need to acknowledge the importance and worth of Drogheda, which is the biggest town in Ireland after Waterford.  It needs a professional political base which it does not currently have.  I urge the Minister to publish his report at the earliest opportunity and look forward to engaging with him on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700032#EE00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1495034100,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the pace of growth of Drogheda.  There is a series of reasons for that growth, including its proximity to Dublin and to international connections through Dublin Airport and the fact that it has provided an affordable option for home buyers.  It has also built a big economy in its own right and is a regional driver in its own right.  However, I do not think the solution here is to recreate city councils, even in cities like Waterford and Limerick, where we have now created City and County Councils.  That said, there is merit in looking at how Drogheda as a town is managed and by whom.  At the moment, a significant proportion of the population is in one county, managed by the local authority in Meath, while the rest of the town, the majority of which is in County Louth, is managed by a different local authority.  In those circumstances, it is very difficult to plan strategically, in terms of business, community development, planning and zoning, commercial rates and so on, for the expansion of a town that may at some point in the future become a city when there are two local authorities involved.  I have made a clear decision on the boundary issues of Waterford and Kilkenny.  We are not changing county boundaries there because there are all sorts of emotions involved in a decision like that.  There are flags, GAA clubs, history and so on involved and asking a Kilkenny person to become a Waterford person or Louth person to become a Meath person will not work politically.  However, we need to be able to re-evaluate governance structures to ensure that towns and urban conurbations can actually be managed as single entities in the context of their expansion.  That is the context in which we need to look at the future of Drogheda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700032#EE00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Surveillance Operations","time":1495034100,"counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700032#EE00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1495034100,"counter":381,"content":"<p>We will now move on to the next topic addressed to the Minister for Justice and Equality, in the names of Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Clare Daly, Boyd-Barrett, Eamon Ryan and Wallace.

I do not always believe everything or, indeed, anything that is published in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>so I acquainted myself through other means with some of the background to the story.  Apparently a highly decorated detective was taking a case against the State for bullying that he endured in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He alleges that he was forced to put illegal phone taps and traces on innocent people.  There was no authority given to track their phones or to listen in to their conversations, in some cases for months on end.<\/p><p>There have been numerous phone tapping scandals over the years in this State.  The Taoiseach said in 2013 that he operated on the presumption that somebody was listening in to his phone calls.  The Attorney General did not have the confidence to speak over the phone to a former Minister for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Alan Shatter, and had to speak to him in person.  When the former Deputy Michael McDowell was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he refused to confirm or deny that the phones of Deputies were being tapped.  He finally admitted in 2003 that the phones of a number of Deputies in this House were tapped.  Journalists' phones were tapped and Deputy Catherine Murphy uses burner phones on the presumption that her phone was being tapped when she was looking into the Siteserv issue.

It is as if this is a big revelation, that nobody knew this was going on and that it is a big surprise.  This is not a surprise.  Our legislation, passed by Members in this House as recently as 2009 and 2011, allows for lawful surveillance of citizens.  I have no doubt the Minister will say that there are perfectly legitimate reasons for that, including counteracting terrorism, serious crime and so forth.  We are told that there are safeguards in place to ensure that the privacy and human rights of citizens are protected but myself and Deputy Wallace have pointed out in this House, particularly during the last D&aacute;il but also in this one, on numerous occasions that the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1993, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 and the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 are not fit for purpose because they do not balance the rights in that regard.  The Minister will say the Defences Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice and Equality can seek to have peoples' phones tapped and to have their records looked at but that there is oversight, that a judge has to look at that at the end of the day.  However, as we have pointed out, the judge who compiles that report goes in on one day, asks to see one or two requests out of thousands and then says that he or she was given everything asked for.  That is not proper oversight and scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  A review was initiated last year when the media suddenly woke up to this issue when the phone records of some members of the media were being requested by GSOC.  Those people were involved in criminality and GSOC was investigating criminal behaviour on the part of garda&iacute;.  That is when the media got interested.

In one case, according to the allegation, a sitting Deputy had his or her phone tapped by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, possibly as a result of pressure from a Minister.  Certainly, the whistleblower believes it was a political move by a Minister at the time.  The garda was subsequently transferred which certainly suggests that there was something seriously amiss and that the correct procedures for getting these taps were not being followed.<\/p><p>Deputy Clare Daly has alluded to the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, which allows for bugging.  The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 allows the police to break into one's house to install cameras and to come back after three months to take those cameras out.  One might not know they were ever in one's house.  There have been extraordinary allegations that all this is being done without proper procedure and oversight, and possibly for political reasons.  The Taoiseach is supposed to get an annual report on complaints, but we have been told that no such records can be found, which is unacceptable.  Will the T&aacute;naiste get these reports?  If there are any irregularities, will she hand the names over to the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Can she say how times phone and mail surveillance has been authorised by her and other justice Ministers under her Government?

We need to find out whether it is true.  If it is true, we must find out who the people involved are.  I take Deputy Clare Daly's point that this should not just be about the political system.  We have this example.  I was interested to listen to what the Taoiseach said yesterday when this matter was raised in the D&aacute;il.  My reading of what he said was that having seen the report of the review of the period in question, he does not think there is any evidence of anything.  Is that the limit of the investigation we are doing?  Given that a whistleblower has raised concerns about an incident involving his removal or change of position, is it not possible for the Minister for Justice and Equality to take targeted measures to find out whether this case is real?  If it transpires that it is real, we need to get the details and ascertain how they can be shared.  It is important for a variety of reasons that this should be done.  I share the concerns expressed by Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Clare Daly and Boyd Barrett about the widespread use of surveillance by the Irish authorities and by the authorities in the UK, the US and elsewhere.  Examples of such activity can be seen around the world at present.  It is important for those of us in the political system to appreciate that if there is any sense that an office on the Government side is being used to put surveillance on the other side, that is hugely damaging to trust in the political system.  It is very important for us to find out who it is.  Until we do that, a whiff of suspicion and rumour will surround anyone who might possibly be involved, even though he or she might be completely innocent.  We need to get to the bottom of this to clear everyone's name.  We need to uncover whether this is true, who exactly was involved and what the consequences will be for the individuals in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700033#FF00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1495034700,"counter":387,"content":"<p>This is the 13th time we have raised this issue in this Chamber.  We have not been getting a whole lot of satisfaction.  In January 2016, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, announced a review of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 regarding information on journalists only.  We pointed out that the review should be all-encompassing and should include the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, as well as the 2011 Act, because all three Acts give State agencies the power to abuse the privacy of Irish citizens and not just journalists.  The T&aacute;naiste has said that the former Chief Justice, John L. Murray, has completed the report of this review.  According to the T&aacute;naiste, this report has been on her desk since 27 April last.  When does she intend to publish the report?  It seems that following the settlement of a High Court case involving a retired detective, the Garda brought the matter to the attention of the designated judge.  Will the Minister tell us how soon after the High Court settlement this matter was referred to the judge?  We met a garda who works in this area not so long ago.  This individual, who was present when the designated judge came around in three separate years, told us that the manner in which this duty was carried out was a joke.  The judge was given a cup of tea, asked to be given a look at this one and that one and said \"have a good day, good luck\".  The system does not stand up to any scrutiny.  It leaves a lot to be desired.  It beggars belief that the T&aacute;naiste is refusing to revisit it.  We need to do things differently.  The same assessment in England runs to 99 pages each year.  Ours is just a rubber-stamping job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700033#FF00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1495034700,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to address this matter.  While it has been alleged in recent reports that there have been abuses in the interception of communications, it would be quite wrong to suggest it has been established that there has been widespread abuse of the interception system.  Of course any abuse would be completely unacceptable.  The reports do not specify the timeframe for these allegations, but I understand, in so far as it can be established, that they relate to the early 2000s.  Plainly, it would be a matter of concern if there were any abuses of the system for intercepting communications.  The notorious improper interception of journalists phones in the early 1980s led to the current legislation, which contains strong safeguards to ensure the system of interceptions is operated properly.  As Deputies are aware, the interception of phones is governed by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, which sets out clearly and in detail the arrangements for giving effect to an interception.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to use the short time available to me to give the House a full understanding of the multilayered checks and balances in the system.  A Minister for Justice and Equality cannot initiate a warrant and can only act on applications made to him or her.  A Minister for Justice and Equality does not and would not have any access to the content of any interception that may be made.  The 1993 Act provides that only the Minister for Justice and Equality may grant authorisations to intercept communications; that this may be done only on the basis of a reasoned application from the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces or the chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; that this may be done only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime and in the interests of the security of the State; and that this may be done only when a number of strict tests, as set out in detail in sections 4 and 5 of the 1993 Act, are satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions that apply to \"serious crime\" are that an investigation is being carried out into a serious crime or to prevent a serious crime, and that investigations not involving interception have not produced and are unlikely to produce the necessary information or evidence and that interception is likely to do so, and that the importance of obtaining the information justifies the interception notwithstanding the interference with privacy.  The conditions that apply to protecting \"the security of the State\" are that investigations are being carried out based on a reasonable belief that activities which are going on endanger the State's security, and that investigations not involving interception have not produced and are not likely to produce the necessary information or evidence and that interception is likely to do so, and that the importance of obtaining the information justifies the interception notwithstanding the interference with privacy.  As a further check, all applications must be considered by a senior officer of the Department before being submitted to the Minister to ensure the conditions set out in the Act are satisfied.  All applications from the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces must also be recommended by the Minister for Defence before submission.<\/p>  <p>  The designated serving judge of the High Court who independently oversees these matters must report to the Taoiseach at least once a year on the operation of the Act.  Over the years, these reports, which are laid before the Oireachtas, have confirmed that the Garda and Army authorities have been in compliance with the Act.  There has been some adverse reflection on the work of the designated judges.  I must say this is utterly ill-founded.  One should not underestimate for a moment the importance of the constitutional independence of the designated judges or, indeed, the considerable experience and abilities of the individuals who have carried out that role with distinction.  The designated judge has full powers of access to all relevant people and documents.  There is a corresponding obligation in law on all relevant people to co-operate.  The current designated judge is Ms Justice Marie Baker.  She is aware of the matters in question as they were raised with her by the Garda authorities.  It is a matter for her to decide what action she will take in respect of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700033#FF00400","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495034700,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Each Deputy has one minute in which to make a supplementary statement.

Despite the protestations about checks, restrictions and oversight, the reality is that our laws allow for wholesale covert surveillance without proper scrutiny and oversight.  Sections 7 and 8 of the 2009 Act specifically allow for tracking devices to be placed on citizens' cars without going to any judicial authority for approval.  It allows for a senior officer above the rank of superintendent to basically certify themselves to carry out covert surveillance on citizens.  The reports the Judiciary do at the end of the day have no numbers, no reasons are given and there is no proper oversight.  They are carried out in a day and a half.  That is not fair.

I have been advised that in May 2008, in the context of illegal action for personal injuries, certain allegations were brought to the attention of the Department of Justice about abuses in the system.  These certain matters and questions related to the early 2000s.  These matters were brought to the attention of the then designated judge who examined them and concluded that there had been no breaches of the Act.  Obviously, the Act has been overseen, as I said, and the designated judges have satisfied themselves that it is being operated in accordance with strict legal requirements.  If there is evidence of anything else, that is investigated at any one particular point.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand that following the settlement of a legal case earlier this year, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contacted the designated judge to bring matters which arose in those legal proceedings to her attention, so the designated judge is aware of these matters and it is a matter for her to decide what, if any, action on her part might be necessary regarding this matters.  To answer Deputy Ryan's question, the appropriate person to look into it is the designated judge who, as I have said, has full and independent powers in this regard.  If one reads the Act, it is very clear that the functions of a designated judge are prescribed by law and I cannot seek to interfere with the exercise of these powers in any way.  The House can be satisfied, however, that a constitutionally independent person is in place with full legal powers to address these matters.  The important issue is not the length of the reports but the substance of the process.<\/p>  <p>  Allegations have been made in reports that the phone of a political activist was intercepted at a time in the past.  It is never the practice to comment publicly on the use of these powers in any particular case.  There are restrictions in the law on the disclosure of the existence of particular interceptions.  In respect of allegations made in reports, they have not been very detailed but it would appear, as I have said, they relate to matters alleged to have arisen in the early 2000s.  Of course, many in this House will recall that at that time there were people who described themselves as political activists who were at the same time engaged in activities in support of unlawful organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700034#GG02800","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1495035300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

I wish to pay tribute to the staff on the ground, the Air Corps, the Army, the Garda, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the staff of Coillte and muintir na h&aacute;ite iad fein.   However, when I raised the matter last week, I got a five-page response from one of the Minister of State's colleagues and the only reference to Galway in it was that \"we are aware that the fires are burning\".<\/p>  <p>  The extent of the fire was extraordinary.  I understand the Minister of State visited the area this week and witnessed the aftermath of the fire where the green cover has been turned to brown and black.  The Cloosh Valley has the largest forest in Ireland, as the Minister of State is aware, which covers 4,000 ha.  Almost a quarter of it has been destroyed as well as 2,000 ha of bogland.  When the fire raged, it raged on three fronts and one of them extended across 8 km.<\/p><p>It affected wildlife, the forest itself and bogland, and it constituted a major threat to family life.<\/p> <p> In that context, although it was not the responsibility of the Minister of State, there was an indication that the Government was either not aware of or not taking seriously what was going on in Galway on that extensive area of land and the destruction of the forest.  First, there was the threat to human life, and second, there was the absolute damage to wildlife and trees.  There is the cost of that and losing mature timber, as well as what it will cost to replace all this.  From listening to a contribution from the citizen science project on the radio, it seems the pollution levels were on a par with those in Beijing.  The only difference is that it will not last, whereas Beijing, unfortunately, has an ongoing problem.  The pollution was equal to that in Beijing, where people wear masks.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for visiting the area this week but I expected somebody to go down sooner.  A warning has been issued to the area, which is welcome, as nobody should be lighting fires, particularly illegal fires.  However, there is a bigger problem and questions must be asked about how this got out of control.  What risk assessments have been done by Coillte, as within the biggest forest in the country we have the biggest wind farm?  The feeling on the ground - I am reporting what was said - was that some of the effort went to preserving that rather than controlling the fire elsewhere.<\/p> <p> In the past ten years there have been very few prosecutions in this area.  If my figures are correct, there were nine prosecutions over ten years.  The Minister of State will deal with the issue of the prosecutions but I am asking a more general question.  When will the Minister get a report on what caused the fire and what has been learned from it?  No matter what we do, we will always have people who light fires when they should not.  There must be an emergency plan in place and proper risk assessment.  When will that report come before us, telling us the damage, replacement plans and timescales?  Most of all, it must inform us how we can prevent this happening in future.  That is the most important lesson to be learned from this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700034#GG03100","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495035900,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Connolly for raising this very serious issue.  As she mentioned, I visited Cloosh Valley in County Galway on Monday and saw for myself the utter devastation caused by the wildfire that raged there until Thursday, 11 May 2017, when it was finally brought under control.<\/p>  <p>  As I commented during my visit, fire poses a serious risk to life, homes, and property.  Forestry and wildlife habitats are also destroyed.  I understand that while a wildfire risk can quickly develop following dry weather patterns in all areas where flammable vegetation such as grasses, gorse and heather are present, especially in proximity to forests and other assets, most fires may have been started deliberately.  To set a fire at this time of the year is not only illegal but also totally irresponsible.  As we are all aware, the burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts.  It is an offence under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976 to burn from 1 March to 31 August in any year any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated.  Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  My Department has no role in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Forest fires have a wide range of impacts.  With Cloosh Valley, I understand approximately 1,500 ha of forestry was destroyed and a similar area of bogland was destroyed on the perimeter, which is where the fire spread from.  This is huge loss and the estimates come to approximately &euro;4 million.  To put this in context, the level of new planting annually for which grants have been paid over the last couple of year is in the region of 6,500 ha, so losing 1,500 ha in one foul sweep like this gives an indication of how massive was this incident.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to cost, there is the loss of the value of the timber crop itself and the reconstitution costs.  There were also the immediate costs involved in fire suppression as incurred by Coillte and the other agencies and bodies, such as the Galway fire service and the Air Corps, which were involved in monitoring and fighting the fires.  In a time of budgetary control, such outbreaks put a heavy strain on all these bodies.  Coillte, for example, has estimated the costs to be in the millions of euro.  Other costs, which are difficult to quantify, include the disruption to normal fire service operation and the diversion of emergency services resources away from other life-saving operations.<\/p>  <p>  I have focussed on the impact on my immediate area of responsibility, namely forestry, but should advise that another impact is the risk to payments under the basic payment scheme, as I advised in my statement yesterday.  Officials in my Department are currently analysing a wide range of satellite imagery to identify land burnt illegally during the specified closed season for burning.  Historic satellite imagery is also being examined as part of this process.  Agricultural and eligible forestry land identified as burnt illegally as part of this investigation will be deemed ineligible for payment under the 2017 basic payment and other area-based schemes.  I want to stress in this regard that my Department will not tolerate incidents of illegal burning of land and will take all necessary actions to ensure compliance with the conditions of the various EU-funded area-based schemes, including reducing payments and penalties where applicable.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is the threat to health.  The Health Service Executive issued a public statement last week about the recent gorse fires, advising that people should limit the amount of time spent outdoors in areas affected by any smoke or ash.  I understand that smoke inhalation can have adverse effects, especially on vulnerable groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700035#HH00200","speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1495035900,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I welcome what the Minister of State is setting out but the difficulty is gorse fires have raged across all the west, with serious damage being done.  This is not the first year it has happened and it has been ongoing for years.  I welcome that the Department is taking satellite images, examining the damage and will take prosecutions if it can, that has simply not worked to date.  A red alert was issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine before the fires broke out.  When that was issued, what did Coillte do and what emergency plan went into place to prevent the damage?  It had been anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome what Coillte has done on the ground but I am talking on a general level.  If a red alert is issued relating to fires, what actions would be taken by Coillte and what risk assessment had been carried out, given its experience over the years?  This is the biggest forest in the country and we know a small group of people burn illegally.  We do not know if that was the cause of the fire.  The risk of damage is too much.  I have not gone into the effect on bird life and diversity as the immediate concern was human life and houses.  This should not have happened.  When will we get a report as to what was lacking in the risk assessment or health and safety statement, or all the other elements that would be relevant to a forest of this size with the biggest wind farm?

There were over 100 people there, including Coillte staff, the Army, Air Corps and some private helicopters who were experts in their actions.  I visited a point where there was a new infrastructural road built by the wind company.  As it was a crown fire, it jumped that road but those 62 km of new road infrastructure allowed emergency services to get in.<\/p>  <p>  I looked at the map before I visited the site.  The suspicion is the fire originated at a point some distance to the south east of the plantation.<\/p><p>The fire would have travelled pretty fast through what is bogland and a special area of conservation, SAC.  The problem for contingency planning is that one would need to look at the perimeter, notwithstanding all the precautions that have to be taken on site and see how that vegetation can be controlled and managed.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, can give derogations for controlled burning, which is an essential part of vegetation management so that material can be edible.  There was a noticeable lack of livestock and sheep on that ground.<\/p> <p> I would not pretend to be the expert but it needs to consider how it will control that buffer zone and the vegetation so that it never gets to the point of being so tall, dry and highly calorific because that will burn.  I have seen people in the Wicklow Gap, maybe hillwalkers or others, who through recklessness throw away a cigarette butt in the dry time when the wind is in the right direction.  As the Deputy said, everything coincided perfectly, the change in wind direction and the drop in temperature assisted greatly in reducing the threat last Wednesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700035#HH00400","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495036500,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.21 p.m. and resumed at 5.01 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Insurance Costs: Motion [Private Members]","time":1495036800,"counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700037#NN00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1495036800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes that:&mdash;

As the Minister of State knows, in June 2016 we used our Private Members' slot to put the focus on motor insurance and proposed changes which we felt would make a real difference to the spiralling premiums people have had to endure.<\/p><p>The Government responded and the following month set up the working group which reported in January 2017, around the same time as the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach reported, with 33 recommendations from the Government's working group and over 70 action points.  I welcome the work that is being done, but more can and needs to be done.<\/p><p>There needs to be greater ambition in the Government's approach and there has to be swifter implementation of the key recommendations, in particular those around the establishment of a national claims database, which is not due for another year or so.  The work of the personal injuries commission needs to be accelerated, and the central issue there is benchmarking the level of awards in Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>awards in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>We need legislation on the motor insurance compensation framework so that if another Setanta Insurance collapse occurs there is clarity on who foots the bill in such a scenario.  That is a priority.  We need to have the report on the role of legal fees in the resolution of insurance claims brought forward earlier than the anticipated date of the second quarter of 2018.<\/p><p>The issue of uninsured drivers is, unfortunately, playing an increasing role in society and is, of course, a menace which has to be condemned in all respects.  The database of uninsured drivers which is technically possible, in terms of the different datasets that are available through the national fleet database, the databases of different insurance companies and so on is not due until the end of 2018.<\/p><p>I welcome the CSO data that shows some stability in the market.  It does not match the reports I have received from constituents who are still receiving renewal notices in the post advising of increases of 20%, 30%, 40% and, in some cases, even more.  There is discrimination against certain categories of drivers.  Drivers with older vehicles which have up-to-date and valid NCT certificates are being asked to pay exorbitant renewal premiums.  God help older or younger drivers, emigrants returning to Ireland or anyone with an open claim, in terms of what quote they will be given.  Taxi drivers are being driven out of business by virtue of the quotes they are getting, if they are lucky enough to get one at all.<\/p><p>We know from the declined cases agreement with Insurance Ireland that the number of people who simply cannot get a quote has multiplied elevenfold in the past four years.  Almost 2,000 cases have been brought before it.<\/p><p>A central issue is the need for greater certainty around the level of awards.  Insurance companies are settling out of court and outside of the injuries board process out of fear of what an award will be if they go through the court process.  That fear is driven by experience.  There is a need for greater certainty and consistency in regard to the level of awards.  Companies are simply not taking the risk.  Many dubious claims are being settled and people are being paid &quot;go away&quot; money, to put it mildly.  That is the reality of what is happening and it is because we have a dysfunctional market which is simply not meeting the needs of consumers.<\/p><p>On the question of business insurance, the CSO is not capturing that data so we have no firm evidence of the level of premium renewals that are being issued to businesses.  The key issue is employer liability and public liability.  Any business that has a significant level of public footfall, businesses in the service industry, pubs, hotels and restaurants are being hammered with significant insurance increases.<\/p><p>The Minister of State and I were interviewed earlier today, and I quoted figures I received from the Restaurants Association of Ireland.  Many restaurants which have had no claims in recent years are facing a doubling of their insurance policies.  It is not good enough and it cannot go on.<\/p><p>Many people in business are now making the decision not to renew their insurance at all and are taking the crazy risk of having no insurance cover in place in respect of public liability or employer liability for their businesses.  Many of these people are not in limited liability companies, therefore they will be on the hook in the event of a claim which could potentially go all the way.<\/p><p>There is a significant degree of commonality between the issues on the motor insurance and employer and public liability sides which affect businesses.  Insurance companies on the business side are becoming increasingly selective.  The terms of policies are being changed.  The levels of excess in policies are increasing significantly.  The levels of exclusions now being specified within policies is also being expanded.  They are vital issues.<\/p><p>The cost of insurance working group, phase two, is now dealing with business insurance.  We are calling for an acceleration of the implementation of the recommendations on the motor insurance side.  They are generally good.  On the business side, we need the report to be published and the CSO to capture the data so that we know where we stand.  We need to start tackling the underlying causes of these increases.  The issue of insurance has now become a major economic issue in our country, as well as being a devastating issue for many families who will end up off the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700037#NN00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1495036800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>It has been a year since my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, introduced the first Private Members' motion to the new D&aacute;il.  A year on, people are still facing, as he outlined, exactly the same challenges in respect of paying motor insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il produced a 12-point plan at the time in response to the 60% or 70% increases consumers and motorists had experienced since 2013 and 2014.

Like my colleague, I commend most of the recommendations but I am concerned about their acceleration and speed.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Michael McGrath said, the virus of spiralling motor insurance costs has now spread to businesses, something which is more than anecdotal.  When I knocked on doors in Tallaght in my constituency, I heard multiple examples of rising insurance costs in one afternoon, in particular from taxi drivers to whom Deputy Michael McGrath referred.  I spoke to two couples who were taxi drivers and whose insurance increased by &euro;1,800 in two years, which is colossal.<\/p>  <p>  What comfort can we and the Minister of State offer those motorists?

There seems to be a particular attack on older people.  Returning emigrants simply cannot get motor insurance.  As Deputy Michael McGrath said, older cars that have passed the NCT cannot be insured.  The Minister of State will agree that there has to be some connection between an NCT certificate and car insurance, otherwise what is the point of getting an NCT certificate?  Any tax cuts people have received and appreciated in the past three years have been wiped out by one car insurance premium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700037#NN00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1495036800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling this motion because it is a very serious issue.<\/p><p>Many businesses have been looking at the colossal rise in insurance costs in the past few years.  When there was a halt in motor insurance cost rises in the past week or so, the claim was made that the strategy dealing with the spiralling cost of insurance was working, but it is on the back of increases of 34% or 35% in a 12 month period.  Businesses, in particular those with a major footfall in retail units, restaurants and nightclubs, are telling me that they simply cannot get insurance.  Is it correct that in respect of some categories of licensed premises, a number of underwriters have left the market which has now been reduced to one or two providers?  If so, it is a damning indictment of the entire insurance industry and the fact that conditions were created which allowed them to leave the market and businesses completely exposed in making decisions to go without insurance.  In respect of other policies, people are having to fork out the first &euro;10,000 of any claim.  This is not sustainable.  I ask the Minister to address the issue of underwriters leaving the market and to explain how the Government permitted circumstances to develop where those providers left.  The cost of motor insurance and, in particular, the cost of insurance for businesses are having a crippling effect and will have a knock-on effect on employment in the sectors mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700037#NN00400","speaker":"1283","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495037400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for raising this issue.  There has been a complete lack of urgency on the part of the Minister in dealing with it.  I have a couple of examples to set out.  The first involves a 33 year old man who is the model citizen as far as this city is concerned.  He lived in an apartment for four years.. As he had no need for a car, he went around on a bike.  He was given a promotion and has now acquired a car, only to be charged &euro;2,300 for insurance.  He pays more per month for insurance than he does for his car.  <\/p>  <p>  The second example involves an emigrant returning from the Continent, which is to say the kind of person the Government is trying to attract as a result of Brexit.  Notwithstanding the fact that they have a perfect driving record, the person concerned is being charged just under &euro;3,000 for car insurance.  It is crucifying us, in particular younger drivers.  Older customers are not even being given quotes.  If a person is over 75 years of age and trying to get an insurance quote in this market, he or she will be loaded beyond belief, if he or she will even be given a quote.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Michael Moynihan said, businesses in the service industry, in particular, are being refused cover because of a lack of competition in the market, all because of a cosy consensus which does not allow out-of-court settlements to be revealed.  Settlements are being made without any record or note being taken of their scope and the impact they are having on insurance costs.  Urgency is required because the issue is affecting our competitiveness and impacting on requests and demands for improved pay and conditions.  It will impact on the Government's ability to attract businesses as a result of Brexit.  Unless there is urgency, we will be back here in a year's time with the problem having got worse.

This is not a new issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il has long called for the Government to act on it.  In 2014 motor insurance costs were increasing at an annual rate of 11.6%, while in 2015, they rose by 30.8%.  In the 12 months to December 2016, they increased by 12.2%.  It is extremely frustrating that it took until January 2017 for the Government to respond to an issue which affects every household in the country.  In simple terms, this and the previous Government have done nothing.  They kicked the can down the road for three years and delayed matters further by establishing working groups and commissioning reports.  In the meantime, small taxi operators and haulage companies have been forced out of business.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance costs are proving to be a major concern for all businesses throughout the country, whether it be motor, public liability or employer's liability insurance.  Many SMEs have experienced business insurance cost increases of between 6% and 15%, while in some cases the increases have been much more.  In addition, insurance companies are using insurance excess figures and exclusions to protect themselves at the expense of their customers.  The Central Bank should be pressurised to take a more hands-on role to regulate the insurance sector to ensure there will be greater transparency.  It is totally unfair that motorists have been left in the dark about the rise in premiums and are expected to put up and shut up as insurance companies act like cartels.  We must bring forward deadlines for certain major action points in the reports such as for the establishment of a national claims information database.  The Government released a quarter one update last week on progress on the report on the rising costs of motor insurance.  Despite being three years into this issue, three of the ten items to be completed in quarter one have yet to be implemented.  It is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  This is scandalous.  A young member of my own family who is 18 years of age was covered under his mother's insurance policy last year as a named driver for approximately &euro;800.  They paid for his lessons, after 11 of which he got his driving licence.  When he went back to take out insurance as a named driver, the insurer asked for &euro;4,500 from him.  It is impossible.  It has gone out of all proportion and is up to the Government to do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700038#OO00300","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1495037400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about this issue and acknowledge the good work done on it by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, consistently in the past few years.  I raised it with the Minister of State as a Topical Issue a couple of weeks ago.  Despite the CSO figures at the time, the Minister of State told me that the trend was that insurance premiums were becoming static, which was to be welcomed.  While I provided examples, the Minister of State said they were anecdotal, but that is not completely true.  Notwithstanding what the CSO figures indicated, it is not what we are all experiencing day in and day out.  With only limited time available to me, I cannot go into all of the examples.  However, the reality is that an acceleration of implementation of the recommendations made in the report is needed.  Despite what the CSO stated and what the Minister of State said here, it is not reflecting positively for consumers, whether private individuals or businesses, particularly in the haulage sector.<\/p>  <p>  This is a real problem which is causing many to drive without insurance or, in some cases, go out of business.  That is unacceptable.  There are inconsistencies such as incidents where insurance companies are not quoting for cars with valid NCT certificates.  There is a massive problem and, despite what has been said, insurance premiums are increasing by more than 30%.  A lady contacted my office on Monday having received a quote for renewal of &euro;850.  Owing to personal circumstances, she did not get to renew it until three days after the renewal date, at which point the same company stated it was a new insurance policy which would cost &euro;3,000.  That is absolutely crazy.  While I accept that the Minister of State is acting in good faith when he tells us things are starting to improve, the fact is that they are not.  All Deputies could bring forward multiple examples, not from the last three months but from the past few days and weeks which demonstrate that things are not improving.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the report must be accelerated to help private individuals and businesses as a matter of urgency in order that they can continue to exist.

I pay more for my insurance today after ten years of driving than I did when I started.  There is something wrong with that.  The cost is crippling and means that many young people cannot afford to get on the road.  As someone from a rural constituency, I know that having a car is a necessity for many, in particular to get to work and school.  At a time when we are trying to get people to return from abroad, the cost of insurance they are being quoted is astronomical.  One is talking about a sum of more than &euro;2,000.  <\/p>  <p>  I turn to the cost to business.  A man in my constituency with a tree surgery business has a fleet of three vans.

The National Competitiveness Council has highlighted that insurance costs are one of the issues of greatest concern to businesses in the country.  Many businesses, in particular small and medium enterprises, are experiencing massive increases in the order of 40% and higher in their premiums for motor, public liability and employer liability cover.  This type of cost escalation is not sustainable for businesses, homeowners or individuals.  If the current situation continues it will become impossible to do business in Ireland from a domestic and foreign direct investment perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The significant cost increase has been borne by small businesses, resulting in job losses and non-expansion by companies.  In the SME sector, which employs 920,000 people, many businesses, in particular retailers, are waiting for the Government to deal with costs, which continue to rise and show no sign of moderation.  High costs make Ireland less attractive to foreign markets and this impacts on exporting sectors and drives consumers to look at other markets for cheaper goods.  The Government must also set out a clear timeline and parameters for phase 2 of the cost of insurance working group, which will look at business insurance.  It needs to be prioritised by the Government as lost competitiveness is a massive risk to Irish businesses.

Dramatically rising insurance costs over recent years have affected almost everybody in this country, whether it be for car insurance, home insurance or business insurance.  Last August I spoke on this very topic and raised the very many concerns I had about rising insurance premiums.  CSO figures released at that time showed that general insurance costs had risen by more than 47% since 2011 and insurance costs in the motor sector had risen by more than 51% in the same period.<\/p>  <p>  I know from my constituency work that people have suffered even greater rises and it must be said this has been for no obvious reason.  In fact, I had one particular case where a person in Dundalk, who owns and drives a 2001 Polo with a 1 litre engine, was quoted almost &euro;5,000 for insurance, with a reduced quote of &euro;3,000 if a driving monitor box was installed.  It should be noted this person had a full driving license and a no claims bonus.  I had other cases where renewal premiums of more than &euro;1,000 were being quoted when in previous years insurance renewal premiums of approximately &euro;500 were the norm.  We in County Louth have been particularly hard hit as we are deemed to be in a high risk category for location purposes.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcomed the establishment of a task force, led by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, which was tasked with reporting on the cost of motor insurance in Ireland.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, on his report.  The group has published a very detailed report highlighting a large number of actions to be undertaken over the next 24 months.  Recently the Minister of State published his first progress report and highlighted that seven of the planned actions had taken place while the remaining three have been partially completed and are due to be fully completed in the very near future.<\/p>  <p>  I know many on the opposite side of the House will attempt to play political games with this issue and, indeed, the motion is a prime example of this.  I ask Members opposite to look at the bigger picture.  The Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, was tasked with the job of finding out why insurance costs are rising, what can be done to halt the rise and to put in place measures to ensure we do not see a sudden increase in insurance costs in the future.  Putting aside all political views, everybody can agree that while we are at a very early stage of the implementation of the actions highlighted in the report we are already seeing some real results.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, insurance costs had risen between 47% and 51% in the period from January 2011 to 2016.  Recently released CSO figures show insurance costs have not risen month on month in 2017.  This is progress and should be treated as such.  Let us not forget the objective of the working group was to identify and examine the causes of the rising cost of insurance and recommend short, medium and long-term measures to be taken to address the issue of rising insurance costs.  Although we are only a short period of time into the implementation of the measures included in the report, we are already seeing some very worthwhile benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, on his work to date on the rising cost of insurance and his initial success in stalling increasing insurance costs.  The cost of insurance is a major expense, not only for businesses but also for private individuals as they insure their cars and homes.  We must ensure we have a fully functioning insurance sector where premiums are at a level that is affordable and sustainable.  I look forward to the publication of the next progress report, which I firmly believe will provide further proof that real results will come as a result of the many actions recommended by the action group for rising insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700039#PP00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1495038000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Government on this very important motion.  The matters raised are very important.  I commend, compliment and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for his work on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government does not dispute that the increase in the cost of insurance has had a negative impact on consumers and businesses, it disagrees with the thrust of the motion that the Government has done nothing to try to address the underlying causes of the problem.  Consequently, the Government will be opposing the motion and will set out in response what has been done to date to tackle this issue.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to tackling the cost of insurance, the first point to note is the establishment of the cost of insurance working group by the Minister for Finance in July of last year and the subsequent work of this group, including its motor insurance report.  In carrying out its task, I remind the House about the collaborative approach which the working group has adopted through its regular engagement and co-operation with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the cost of insurance project.  In this regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has made several appearances before the committee and has been held accountable.  He has listened very closely to the views of the committee and its Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness.  While there are some differences in emphasis between the respective reports, there are far more similarities than differences.  There is also a recognition in both reports that there is no single policy or legislative silver bullet to stem or reverse premium price rises immediately.  This suggests there is an appreciation by the committee report that it will take a certain amount of time to transform the current insurance premium landscape.  This is the reality.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of insurance working group produced its first quarterly report on the progress of the implementation of the action plan at the start of this month.  This report provides a comprehensive update on progress to date and reasons where delays exist.  The Government remains committed to continue to drive implementation in a timely manner in line with the prescribed deadlines in order to stabilise this important sub-sector of the domestic economy.  It should also be noted that the timeframes chosen for various recommendations and actions were considered very carefully by the cost of insurance working group.  Great care was taken to strike a balance between the urgency of implementing change as soon as possible and the realisation that where significant initiatives are being undertaken time is required to ensure the necessary consultation is carried out before decisions are made as to how to take such projects forward.  A good example of this is the establishment of the personal injuries commission.  This body lies at the heart of this current review process.  However, before it can come to any conclusions about what changes are needed as to how injuries are assessed and how they are graded, it first needs to carry out, among other things, a comprehensive data gathering exercise to assess systems for handling personal injuries claims elsewhere.  This takes time and this is why we have given it until quarter four of 2017 to submit its first report.<\/p>  <p>  The motion makes a number of valid points, and I accept this, with regard to the rising cost of business insurance.  However, it is incorrect to say the Government is not doing anything to address this issue.  Deputies will be aware the cost of insurance working group commenced the second phase of its work in January to look at public and employers' liability insurance in parallel with implementing the motor insurance recommendations.  The working group is building on the work done in the motor phase to determine how it can be applied in the employer liability and public liability insurance claims areas.  The working group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues.<\/p><p>Extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders have been held.  Further consultations are also planned and submissions have been invited from interested  parties.<\/p> <p> With regard to specific points raised around the timeframe for this work, the  intention is to publish an addendum to the motor report, covering employers liability, EL, and public liability, PL.  While a final report may not be ready until September, this does not mean that work on EL and PL reforms will only commence then.  It is hoped that there will be clarity around the potential new measures in July.  As soon as there is certainty about the planned direction of travel, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will publish accordingly and will appear before the Oireachtas committee to explain the underlying thinking.<\/p> <p> The latest data from the Central Statistics Office indicates that motor insurance inflation in 2017 has remained flat month-on-month.  There was 0% change from December 2016 to April 2017.  As of April 2017, motor insurance was 6.1% below its recent peak in July 2016.  If this trend continues, the Government is hopeful that it might be signalling the start of a stabilisation of pricing in the  market.<\/p> <p> For the reasons outlined, the Government does not accept the assertions made in the motion and must oppose it as it gives no recognition to the significant level of work done to date by the Cost of Insurance Working Group on addressing the cost of insurance issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700039#PP00400","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495038600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Deputy Pearse Doherty is sharing with colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700040#QQ00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1495038600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt ama le mo chomghleacaithe.  There is an advertisement that appears regularly on people's social media.  It is from Insurance Confidential and is an Insurance Ireland creation.  The advertisement is supposed to show us how fraud is the reason all of us have been paying so much more for car insurance in the past few years.  Every so often the advertisement pops up on social media and users can comment underneath it.  It is hilarious, and it is interesting to read the comments.  Most of them use very unparliamentary language.  If I was to repeat some of it I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would have a lot to say about my language here but the general consensus is that nobody is buying the line from the insurance industry spin or its distraction campaigns.  One states, \"My insurance premium is higher because of greedy insurance companies\" and \"childish advertisement\" is one comment that sums up most of the others.<\/p>  <p>  As the motion before the House states, and I commend Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing it forward, it has been three years since we have seen an explosion in motor insurance premiums, yet this week I have heard of young and middle aged drivers who are receiving quotes for hundreds of euro on top of their existing high premiums.  Many people do not have the option and cannot find better value when they shop around so it is a case of pay up or get off the road.  The Facebook users know the score, and we all know the score.  The insurers are still getting away with it just as they have done for the past few years.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's report has some very good ideas but they need to be implemented as soon as possible.  It has other ideas that are simply feeding the straw men that have been set up by the insurers.  I repeat what has been obvious to me and to my party for a long time.  All the legal fees, the fraud and the excuses dreamt up by insurers do not come close to explaining the massive increases we have seen, and are still seeing in some cases, in motor insurance premiums.  The insurers invested poorly and their business model, which delivered so much profit for so long, has failed them and consumers are now paying the price.  No amount of Government initiatives can change that but transparency is the key to at least removing the excuses, and lack of transparency favours the insurers and only adds to the suspicion of cartelism.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the focus in the motion on tackling the use of so-called failure to disclose by consumers as an excuse by insurers to prevent payouts.  My Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill, which has passed Second Stage in this House and is awaiting Committee Stage, proposes changes to the law so that this type of behaviour will be much more difficult to get away with.  The onus in that legislation would be put on the insurers to ask the relevant questions instead of on the consumer to know the information that will be held against him or her eventually.  The Bill contains many other measures that are needed to level the playing field so that the consumer, be that the small business or the individual, can stand up to the insurers.  It is part of the overall solution package.<\/p>  <p>  The motion put forward by Deputy McGrath is correct to look at the cost of business insurance in the same way we have looked at the issue of motor insurance.  Many of the same issues apply and as far as I am concerned, the same root cause is to be found.  The more public fuss there is about car insurance the more the insurers are likely to spread their increases across other areas.  That is what we are seeing in terms of recent trends.  Health and home insurance will not be immune either.  When I asked the committee on finance to look at this issue I hoped that swift intervention would have shamed the insurers into delivering fair prices.  We are seeing some movement in that regard but we are also seeing that they have hunkered down and are trying to brazen out the storm, and in some ways the Government has facilitated them and even met them half way in some of their claims.<\/p>  <p>  I support this motion.  Pressure needs to be kept on the Government to meet its own timetable at least, which is very poor, and I made that point in the debate on the Government's report.  Motor insurance and business insurance keep the economy moving.  When the system that implements them is failing it has huge implications.  The answer must be a greater role for the State in this issue when the private sector is so clearly failing to deliver a functioning market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700040#QQ00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1495038600,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on this Private Members' motion.  This is an issue that is affecting citizens across this State.  Insurance companies would have us believe that fraudsters, excessive court settlements and the costs associated with the legal profession are the reasons behind the huge increases in motor insurance.  Basically, they want to blame their customers but if we scratch the surface we can see that far from being solely the fault of others, it was the investment policies of many of these insurance companies faring far worse than expected, during a time of low interest rates, that resulted in worse than expected returns.  To make up for that, they are the heaping extra costs onto drivers, many of whom have clean driving records and never had a claim in their lives.  That is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen a huge drop in the number of people holding learner permits in the past decade.  Part of the reason for that is because many young people see no point in learning to drive as the costs are so high.  This week I was contacted by a constituent who had returned here having been away for a year only to find that the cost of her insurance had gone through the roof, so to speak.  She had nine years of driving experience, five on a full license, and she had never been in a collision or accident, yet her insurance cost has quadrupled to over &euro;3,000.

Deputies across the House have been constantly saying that.<\/p>  <p>  There is huge public anger about this issue.  The insurance companies have not taken any responsibility and have made every attempt to deflect from their duty to address this issue.  The failing business model employed by insurance companies is the real reason for the increases and customers have become the easy targets to recover the losses from imprudent investments.  I commend my party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, for all his hard work in highlighting this important issue.  It was on foot of his suggestion that the committee on finance engaged with relevant stakeholders and produced a report.  The report of the finance committee lays out clearly many measures that would help create greater transparency and would potentially reduce prices. Furthermore, the Government&rsquo;s own report on the issue makes 70 separate recommendations in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue relating to motor insurance is the refusal of insurance companies to insure cars that they deem to be old.

Most of the focus at the time was on the economic viability of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  One of the pieces of information that came to my attention at the time was that the director of Bus &Eacute;ireann stated the cost of insurance claims within the company had risen from &euro;1.5 million in 2014 to &euro;7 million in 2016.  We were told this was one of the reasons there was downward pressure on workers' pay and entitlements.  I wondered at that time how insurance increases could be the cause of downward pressures on workers' wages.  Surely shocking increases in the cost of insurance would be reasons for the downward pressures on insurance costs.  Bus &Eacute;ireann either became extremely negligent, or had accidents it could not deal with, or the insurance industry was responsible for developing an unfair situation.  Conas gur f&eacute;idir an m&eacute;ad&uacute; at&aacute; tagtha ar chostais &aacute;rachais a &uacute;s&aacute;id mar leithsc&eacute;al don bhr&uacute; anuas ar thuarastail oibrithe?

The latter either have major difficulties functioning as businesses or they are having their transportation ability curtailed in a massive way.  This is happening because of the cost of insurance.  A typical small business in Navan, County Meath, employs 15 people and has been open for about nine years.  Its insurance cost was roughly &euro;7,000 for about eight years.  Last year, it went up to &euro;14,000.  The business never had a claim.  The reason it gives is that it feels there are not enough competitors in the market.  It has a choice of only two separate companies from which to procure its insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Another business in Meath opened four years ago.  It had an insurance cost of about &euro;2,500 per year.  This has increased to about &euro;8,500.  The business has had two claims made against it.  It obviously believes these claims are unfair, etc., but it is not for me to say whether they are.  It is important, however, to note that a claim or two can actually push a business over the tipping point in terms of functionality.  Another business in Meath, which has just won a competition for the best business of its class in the whole State, has told me its insurance has jumped from &euro;8,000 to &euro;12,000.  Therefore, there are many businesses that have come through eight or nine years of really difficult trading experiences that are just at the very edge of functionality.  Now they are being hit with massive costs.<\/p>  <p>  A couple of months ago, I organised a public meeting in Meath on insurance.  We were inundated with people at the meeting.  An individual told me his insurance cost increased from &euro;450 per year to &euro;900 per year for absolutely no reason.  Another individual told us they had to pay &euro;2,600 for car insurance.  A young woman driver who attended the meeting was quoted &euro;6,500 for car insurance.<\/p>  <p>  A key point I took from the meeting concerned the issue of older cars.  It became very clear that a number of participants stated they had cars that were over 15 years old.  The cars were fully functional, safe, in perfect working order and with an NCT certificate.  That they cannot be insured has the effect of saying to two elements of our demographic that they will not be able to drive.  Young people and people on low incomes are the people likely to be driving these cars.  <\/p>  <p>  The structure of the insurance industry is broken.  The Government is responsible for the development of the conditions for industries to function in.  One of the key problems with the Government is that it does not seem to be tackling the dysfunction within the insurance industry.  There are serious ramifications.  Ireland is currently suffering massive increases in inflation in a number of specific areas.  There was a report a couple of days ago stating Dublin is now in the top ten cities in the world with regard to construction costs.  We are seeing an erosion of the competitiveness of the country.  For the past few years, every time the issue of competitiveness came to a head the Government focused on workers' wages, conditions and entitlements but did not seem to feel the same need to focus on insurance.  <\/p>  <p>  The gamut of products and services we consume as a people is being affected by insurance costs in this country.  Day by day, younger people and poorer people, including those on lower incomes, are being prevented from functioning in the economy itself.  It is really important that the Government consider this.

We will be supporting it.  I believe the Minister of State to be genuine in his attempts to deal with this issue.  If we had one criticism, it would be that some of the deadlines should be sooner rather than in quarters three and four of this year.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to speak briefly to some of the issues inherent in the update of 3 May, as presented by the Minister of State.  Recommendation No. 6 relates to ensuring greater consistency of treatment for returning immigrants.  When the Minister of State is responding, I would be very grateful if he could let us know whether there is scope within the recommendation to ensure such a protocol is achieved, perhaps by the end of quarter two or three, because it is such a vital issue.  I do not need to rehearse in the House the issues that affect returning immigrants but if the protocol could be designed in a way to ensure it may be implemented with greater haste, it would provide a lot of confidence for people who are returning from abroad.<\/p>  <p>  On recommendation No. 7, on the subjection of the declined cases agreement to ongoing review to ensure transparency, we welcome the progress.  I seek clarification on the exact position at present.  Bearing in mind the review, the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong on Insurance Ireland's updating of its website.  My understanding from the report of 3 May is that Insurance Ireland has actually updated the website.  Again, I want clarification on that.<\/p>  <p>  On recommendation No. 8 of the Minister of State's report, dated 3 May, there is a to be a protocol for policyholders to be notified of claims made against them before settlement date.  I seek a real-time clarification from the Minister of State on that.  That was a matter of some discussion today in the media.  The Minister of State and Deputy Michael McGrath referred specifically to it.  I was listening to the discussion in passing.  What is the position on that?<\/p><p>There is a school of thought that such a recommendation should be much stronger and that defendants should be given an opportunity to mount a defence instead of an insurer deciding that it is uneconomic to defend and going to a default payment mechanism.  I acknowledge Deputy Michael McGrath on that point because he raised it on the Sean O'Rourke show earlier today.<\/p> <p> We all want to ensure the cost of motoring will be reduced for every motorist, regardless of his or her demographics and the age of the vehicle.  I was a member of the finance committee that reported on this issue and one of the major issues was related to older vehicles.  If an older vehicle passes the NCT, the owner should not be discriminated against because of its age.  That does not make an ounce of sense as the NCT is subject to the law of the land.<\/p> <p> I have serious difficulties with the issue of transparency because we were told all along that the reason for the stark increase in the cost of premia was the provisioning that was necessary on the part of insurance companies to cover losses.  There is nothing in the reports about this, but I have a great difficulty with the amount provided for.  People will accept an increase in their premia, but they cannot sustain the increases they have had to sustain in the past 12 months.  The insurance industry is telling us a corrective mechanism is in place whereby premia have been reduced by 40% in some instances.  A component has to be pure and utter profit.  There is no transparency on that profit making.<\/p> <p> Another issue I have is that Insurance Ireland seemed to speak for the industry at the committee hearings.  It is not about personalities, but I found it difficult to understand why one person with one voice seemed to represent the entire industry.  Will the Minister of State outline whether the working group has heard from voices other than Insurance Ireland?  In other words, have the chief executive officers of insurance companies dealt directly with him?  What has been the nature of the engagement between them?  Consumers would not necessarily recognise Insurance Ireland as the sole voice of the sector.  It would be useful for us to have some insight from the Minister of State into what his engagement was with them.  It would be even better if he named the individual companies.  I doubt that he will, but I make the request respectfully.<\/p> <p> We support the motion.  I recognise the work the Minister of State is doing, but I would like him to ensure the goals to be attained within certain quarters are fast-tracked, particularly in the case of returning emigrants.  Perhaps he might have something to say about that.  It would be useful and send a signal.  I would also like him to comment on the issues affecting older drivers, drivers of older vehicles and public service vehicles and the distinction between taxis and so on and SMEs that have fleets but which find their insurance costs have gone through the roof.  He should ensure a level playing field in respect of transparency on the difference between the provisioning and the corrective measures he has said are being introduced and the profits generated.  People want to feel that they are not being screwed.  I do not know if the word \"screwed\" is unparliamentary language, but I am speaking in the vernacular.  It is unfair that consumers find themselves in this position at this time.  I have no doubt that I will receive a letter if the word is deemed to be unparliamentary.  I read the list of prohibited words lately and the term \"corner-boy\" was proscribed.   Perhaps that is now anachronistic, but it was appropriate at a certain time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700041#RR00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495039800,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I will have to refresh my memory on the appropriate phraseology to be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700042#SS00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1495039800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>We do not want the insurance industry to act like a corner-boy in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700042#SS00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1495039800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling the motion on an extremely important subject.  Huge numbers of citizens are being ripped off by insurance companies.  I primarily want to address the cost of motor insurance, but I will comment on the cost of health insurance initially.  It is the biggest scam ever.  I would never take out private health insurance on principle because in the area of health it is obscene and unacceptable that we have a two-tier system under which people receive premium health care if they pay and second-class health care if they do not.  It is worse than that because many of the inadequacies in the public health system result precisely from the existence of a private health tier and private health insurance leeching off the public system, a little like fee paying schools.  They receive the benefits of public funding and support, while generating a premium above it to support a two-tier system.<\/p>  <p>  I understand many people take out private health insurance out of fear of the public system, but the problem is that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  By taking it out, they reinforce the system.  I do not blame those who do it out of fear, but, ironically, are they better off with private health insurance?  It is a serious question as to whether they are because when it comes to the most serious illnesses, they end up having to go back into the public system.  The private health insurance industry is a parasite on the public health system and resources and finance that should go into providing a quality universal health system for all.  The Government parties often talk, as a way of absolving themselves of the crisis in the public system, about the fact that Ireland spends one of the highest proportions of GDP on health services, but they always fail to say a huge portion of that figure, approximately &euro;3 billion, is paid to the private system.  When it is taken out, one realises why there is a crisis in the public health system.  We mirror the United States in that sense.  A total of 40% of expenditure on health services in the United States basically represents profiteering by the private health insurance industry and other private health service providers.  We should get rid of private health insurance by having a national health system.  It is one extortionate cost imposed on huge numbers of people that could be removed.<\/p>  <p>  I do not disagree with anything in the motion and there is not much with which I disagree in the reports of the Minister of State and the Oireachtas joint committee which made some good recommendations.  However, none of them will address the problem, which is that motor insurance providers are profiteering from the fact that it is a mandatory legal requirement to have motor insurance if one drives.  They have a captive audience<\/p><p>Many people do not have a choice about driving.  A car is necessary for many people in rural areas where public transport is woefully inadequate.  One has to have insurance, otherwise one is breaking the law.  For elderly people, people with mobility problems and people who earn their living through driving - the most obvious are taxi drivers but there are other jobs that require a car - one is captive in that one has to drive and the law requires one to have insurance, but the State does not provide a minimum level of not-for-profit insurance.  Therefore, one is prey for the private motor insurance companies which profiteer from the fact that they have a captive market.<\/p> <p> The transparency measures do not go far enough.  The emphasis put by the Government in the prelude to these reports was all about fraudulent claims, overstating the extent of those fraudulent claims, legal costs, which are a factor but do not explain the dramatic increases in recent years, and giving more information to the consumer about the breakdown of premiums or increases and all the rest of that.  They do not get to the fundamental problem, and I do not think any of these measures will get to the fundamental problem, that the private insurance companies with a captive market can always find ways to ratchet up premiums to make money.<\/p> <p> Private insurance companies are entirely tied up with a market.  The biggest reason for the big increases was that their investments went bad.  They lost much money on the markets and then decided to recoup that money by screwing the premium holders and people seeking insurance.  That was the major reason for these dramatic increases, and nothing is going to stop, including the measures proposed in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion, in the Government's recommendations or for that matter by the all-party Oireachtas committee.  Given that it is a legal mandatory requirement, there has to be the provision of some sort of basic motor insurance which is affordable for everybody on a not-for-profit basis.  If people want premium insurance after that, they can go to the private market.<\/p> <p> This is a legal requirement.  If it is a legal requirement, the State has to make it affordable for those who need it.  Taxi drivers are literally being put out of business by these guys.  If one has the slightest prang - of course, one is going to have small prangs if one is driving all the time for a living - one is gone.  Premiums are already massively high and people who have never had accidents are getting premiums of &euro;17,000 and &euro;20,000, which are ridiculous figures.  That is not sustainable for taxi drivers.  Of course, over the course of driving for a living, one is going to have some little accident, which is not even one's fault.  It could be a small thing, but that is it - one is out of a job.  There has to be a particular control or the provision of a special category of insurance premiums and policies to allow taxi drivers to function, or for that matter other people who have to drive for a living.  Something has to be done about the issue of discrimination against the elderly, against young people and against rural dwellers.  I also believe young nurses and other health care workers are getting punitive premiums, and I believe journalists also get punitive premiums for some reason just because they are journalists.  I do not quite fully understand that.  That discrimination should not be allowed.<\/p> <p> I asked the Minister of State about this and he said that is just the way insurance works.  He said companies look at categories of drivers and this is going to influence the premiums.  That is not fair.  If one happens to be in one of those categories, but has a perfectly good record, or has a car that passed the NCT, but happens to be older, one is penalised.  That penalises the young or less well-off but it is just not fair.  None of the Minister of State's measures is doing anything to deal with that unfairness and discrimination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700042#SS00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495040400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I will just look at motor insurance and will refer to a reply from the Minister to a parliamentary question in which he said that there was no silver bullet to reduce the costs of insurance.  He acknowledged the volatility in the market and then said that co-operation and commitment between all parties can deliver fairer premiums for consumers without unnecessary delay.  I welcome the report of the working group and the recommendations, actions and timeline, but we are not seeing any action on it.  What we are seeing is life becoming very difficult for motorists, in particular in Dublin.  The increase in the insurance costs is just another factor in that.<\/p>  <p>  I want to look at particular groups, which Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned.  Taxi drivers use their cars to make a living.  I have numerous constituents who are taxi drivers and they tell me they cannot afford to work.  Their taxis are off the road because of the huge increase in insurance.  These are taxi drivers who have completed all the tests.  They are adhering to very stringent standards, including the NCT and public service yearly checks.  They are dealing with increasing anti-social behaviour on the part of some customers.  They are providing a service and are being crippled by the rise.  I have seen increases of insurance up to over &euro;10,000.<\/p>  <p>  For pensioners, some insurers make the cost of insurance so high for them that they are forced to give up their cars.  These pensioners use their cars for mobility, for their independence and for leisure activities and their children depend on them to bring their grandchildren to various activities.  Now they are not able to drive because of the increase, which will increase their isolation and dependence.  I have one constituent, aged 70, with 20 years no claim bonus, who faced a 70% increase.  This will mean she has to rely on her neighbours to do the chores she could have done herself.  We also have families who rely on their cars and who are being crippled by these insurance costs.<\/p>  <p>  I also mention these foreign-registered companies that go into liquidation, the policyholders being left in difficult situations and the industry footing the bill.  It is really the customers having to pay the exorbitant increases, so I do not understand this collective liability.  There is a need for a central EU database to ensure common standards.  People are turning to companies based outside Ireland and I think there could be disastrous consequences.  It is their right to make this choice, but I think they need to know the risks involved.  We are also aware of the discrepancy between what the insurance industry is saying and the legal profession we are paying, but in the middle is the customer who is paying the price.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of a very disturbing situation relating to house insurance for a person with a disability.  There are extremely aggressive policies from the insurer, backed by a US vulture fund investor that has taken over the insurance.  I hope the debate will lead to some action because that will speak louder than words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700043#TT00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1495040400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening on the costs of insurance.  We could probably all use our time citing cases which have heard about in our constituency offices in regard to the costs of insurance for people who have no choice but to have cars and small businesses which have no choice but to have insurance.  I want to cite one case of a young man in Donegal who has to have a car for work and was quoted &euro;6,000 for car insurance.  He would be working for a year just to insure his car.  Those are the kinds of increases people are facing throughout the country.  It is over three years since this crisis was flagged.  The action which has been taken is quite disappointing when one sees the time taken to get the reports of the insurance working group.<\/p>  <p>  The myths the insurance companies have been putting out must be dispelled.  We hear the narratives that fraud, legal costs, the costs of claims and so on are causing the increase in the cost of insurance policies.  The most interesting sentence in the report on the costs of motor insurance is that the working group did not find that legal costs were a major contributory factor in the recent increases in premiums.  The working group set up to look at it has shot out of the water the reasons put by the insurance industry about costs.<\/p><p>I believe it is true that the reason the costs have gone up is that insurance companies' returns on investments have gone down over the last couple of years.  That is why.  It is because of the business model of the insurance companies.  That is what has lumped the cost on.  Yet, the Government buys into the narrative that fraud, legal costs and everything else is lumping it on.<\/p> <p> It is worth noting that Zurich Insurance made $2.9 billion in profits in 2015.  Allianz made &euro;10.5 in profits in 2016.  These are extremely profitable companies that are gouging their own customers because they know they will get away with it.  That is the bottom line.  They know they can do it.  As was mentioned earlier, due to the fact that it is a legal requirement to have at least third-party insurance in this country if one wants to drive, there is an onus on the State to ensure that people can achieve that minimum standard.  If that means the State should establish its own insurance company to provide that, we should be doing that and it should have been done already.  We should not have to say that it should be done.  The only way to put manners on the insurance companies is to provide insurance for people.  The companies will then change their tune.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700043#TT00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495041000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  I generally support the tenor of the debate this evening.  For three years now, we know that premiums have gone up very high by more than 50%.  We know that more people are being forced into driving without insurance because they cannot afford the insurance as it is so high.  I want to take the opportunity to deal with some of the issues that have been raised already about car insurance.<\/p>  <p>  I was recently contacted by a constituent.  Like many stories we have heard, my constituent has seen an almost 400% increase in the cost of basic third-party fire and theft insurance in two years.  In 2015, he was able to get insurance for &euro;400.  In 2016, it went up to almost &euro;700.  This year, he was quoted &euro;1,472.  He tried ringing around.  He got one quote for more than &euro;2,000 but most refused to even offer him a quote.  Was this person some sort of dangerous maniac?  Has he been guilty of drink-driving or dangerous driving?  He has not.  Does he have penalty points?  No.  Does he have a full licence?  Yes, since 1974.  Does he have a medical condition that makes it unsafe for him to drive?  No.  Is the car roadworthy?  Yes, it passed the NCT.  Therefore, what was the problem?  He was over 65.  There was no other reason.  I note that a recommendation of the report states that the insurance companies must advise and tell somebody why he or she is being refused.  However, that is no use if one cannot get insurance anywhere else.  It good to have a bit of transparency, but it is not going to make the fundamental difference.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies are penalising older drivers.  It is a major issue for Age Action.  Older people have taken up this issue themselves and are pushing for it.  The companies are also penalising young drivers.  USI has come out with many instances of its members facing huge premiums.  A young woman called into my office whose car was 13 or 14 years old.  She obviously needed the car.  She was travelling around with an old car.  If one is on a low wage, one is not going to be going out spending big money on big cars.  One is using the car to get around.  She was quoted nearly &euro;2,500.  It is just unbelievable.  As has been said, car insurance is mandatory.  If a person has a full licence with no convictions, no penalty points and a roadworthy car that has passed the NCT, he or she should be entitled to affordable insurance.<\/p>  <p>  This situation is forcing people off the road, or even worse, to drive without insurance.  The Government must act.  As had been said by Deputies Pringle, Boyd Barrett and O'Sullivan, there must be a neutral not-for-profit company that would provide affordable basic insurance to people like those constituents who are facing those basic third-party insurance costs.  That has to be the case.  If we do not do that, nothing is going to change because, as has been said, the insurance companies know that they have a captive audience, they know that people cannot go anywhere else and they know that people have to drive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700044#UU00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1495041000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath and the Fianna F&aacute;il party for putting this motion before the Chamber and for giving us the opportunity to discuss this very serious matter of which, as public representatives, we are reminded every single day and maybe several times in any one day.  Young drivers cannot get realistic quotes that they can afford to pay.  I am of the belief that one should always give young people a chance at least until they blot their copybook.  They are entitled to be treated fairly until that happens.  They should at least get a chance and be allowed to start off.  Young people need their cars, especially where we come from.  There is no mode of transport in rural places other than a car and one needs to have a car of one's own.  Many of these youngsters now cannot go to work because they cannot afford insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, old drivers are being penalised.  Their quotes are being doubled.  That is not fair and it makes no sense.  Quotes for taxis and hackneys have gone up.  The cost of their yearly premiums has gone up.  I know of two cases in which the quote rose to &euro;14,000.  They could not come up with that kind of money and it forced them off the road.<\/p>  <p>  I will give one example in each case.  I know of a haulier who paid &euro;70,000 last year.  This year, he is being quoted &euro;250,000.  That is the truth.  Youngsters of 21 years of age are being asked to pay &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000.  They cannot afford that.  Returning to old people, I know of one man who never had a crash in his life.  His insurance went up from &euro;340 to &euro;780.  He has actually paid it.  I know another man who was a bit luckier.  His quote went a way up as well from around &euro;300 to more than &euro;700.  He went along and told his son about it.  His son had a lot of vehicles and could not believe the figure his father was being quoted.  The son went along the insurance company or broker and asked how his father was being charged so much.  The response was, \"Oh, is he your father?\".  This is a fact.  The son said that it was his father and the company said to leave it with them.  They came back after a few hours and said that his premium would be the same next year.  That tells me that something is going on and that insurance companies are not being honest.<\/p>  <p>  There is a huge increase in claims and the value of claims.  There are companies out there especially putting claims together for solicitors.  Claimants cannot lose because the legal profession operates on the basis of \"no foal, no fee\".  They cannot lose.  Why is it that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is only dealing with 20% of the claims?  For a serious case of whiplash in England, the maximum payout a claimant can get is &pound;7,600.  For a very minor one here, a claimant will get &euro;18,400.  For a serious one, a claimant will get &euro;77,000.  A girl got &euro;76,000 for her finger being caught in a door.  The solicitor got &euro;47,000 of that.  I will not say where it was, but another solicitor boasted that he got &euro;80,000 for such a claim and said that if others have similar cases, he can get that money for them too.  A fella who slipped on a wet floor when he was actually pushed, for some reason or other - I cannot understand it - got &euro;750,000.  I have said it before that the fraud squad or some special investigation unit should be put into action to follow these things up because this is what is causing much of the increases, or at least this is what we are being told is the cause of the increase in quotes and premiums for the young, the old and the business people I mentioned.<\/p><p> If we go back about 14 years, we had the same scenario in this country.  People could not afford insurance because it had become very expensive at that time.  I know that because my oldest two lads were coming on the scene at the time and I could not insure them on their own.  I had to insure them on an old jeep I had and put them on my insurance.  That is a fact.  We do not have enough competition in the insurance market at present.  I will say categorically that while Se&aacute;n Quinn was operating we could pay for insurance.  Sadly, he has been taken out of it.  People could get insurance and when he was there, they could pay for it.  He was taken out but he would have paid his way back.  The bankers who broke the country were let off and they got away with it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett brought the issue of health insurance to my attention and I agree with him.  How is it if a person is in hospital for two or three days, he or she is liable to pay about &euro;75 a night for his or her stay yet if he or she has VHI the hospital will take a fee of &euro;800 or &euro;850 from VHI for the same stay?  Why is that happening?  It is the HSE that is doing it.  It is driving up the cost of private health cover.  That should be investigated.  It is happening everywhere.  Regardless of what hospital it is, it is happening and it is unfair because, at the end of the day, it is the public that has to pay for it.<\/p> <p> We are raising all these issues in respect of the cost of insurance with the Minister of State, and I have done so since I came here.  Something needs to be done.  The Government should have a role to play when someone has been refused insurance or when someone is given an exorbitant quote he or she cannot pay.  The Government or some independent body should have the power to ask why that is the case because it is totally unfair.  It is the most common thing we are asked at our clinics and especially when we meet youngsters.  They are trying to get going and want to get out in the world but they are being prevented from doing that.  There must be more competition in the market and the Government must investigate further to ensure companies are acting fairly because I do not believe they are at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700044#UU00300","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495041600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>We are all in a unique position because we interact with the public all the time.  One of the issues on people's minds is the cost of living.  One of the major concerns is the cost of insurance and motor insurance is a significant factor in that context.  The high cost of living has undermined the ability of many families to make ends meet.  Motor insurance becomes one of those out-of-the-ordinary costs and unexpected, big increases can really cripple a family's monthly budget.  The average cost of insurance has risen by over 60% since 2012.  Such an increase is proof positive the system is dysfunctional.  We have all heard stories.  Most Deputies or their family members will have had experience of premiums rising dramatically since last year despite the fact there may have been no change in circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Just this week I had contact from a constituent who after 40 years of driving claim-free had cause to make a claim on his policy in 2016.  This resulted in him having his premium increased by &euro;455 for the next year, bringing it to &euro;894.  He shopped around for a few weeks and tried to see if he could get a better quote.  While he was doing that his insurance company withdrew the quotation of &euro;894 and is now seeking &euro;2,770.  The man is 40 years driving with no claims and is facing a premium not far off &euro;3,000.  It will obviously not be just one year; it will be an issue that will go on for several years.  It is absolutely outrageous.  While it is true things have calmed down in terms of increases in motor insurance over the last number of months, the fact remains the insurance regime is flawed and requires a new way of doing business.<\/p>  <p>  We are almost an outlier in terms of international standards for some injury awards.  A broken arm in the UK tends to attract an average settlement of &pound;5,000 whereas here, the average award for the same injury is &euro;16,000.  It is legitimate to ask why there is a discrepancy.  The &pound;5,000 might be too low but is there a good reason for the discrepancy?  There is an urgent need to provide far better settlement guidance for judges and for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board when it comes to making decisions on injury settlements.  Where there are injuries that merit awards or very high awards, it is imperative those awards are in keeping with the seriousness of the injury, the rehabilitation required and the loss of earnings and potential earnings.  It is important there is transparency in how it is calculated.  It is possible to reduce legal costs associated with personal injuries claims by improving the methods of non-litigation settlement and thereby further reducing costs.  Once the legal profession is involved in the court system, it becomes a very big element of any settlement.<\/p>  <p>  Small and medium businesses in this country face significant bureaucratic pressures and ever-increasing costs associated with trying to run a business.  Motor and business insurance are chief among them.  It simply does not make economic sense to cripple businesses with exorbitant insurance costs which could potentially price them out of business and reduce the number of people who are contributing.  <\/p>  <p>  Of the ten action points specified in the Government's report on the cost of motor insurance, which came after the crisis in the industry had pretty much exploded, three have still not been completed.  Much data is collected and we should have a mechanism for monitoring the situation and not allow it to get to the point of a crisis.  In the past number of years, we have had a number of debates in the House on this issue when it escalates to the point of being routinely on the airwaves.  <\/p>  <p>  I will make a comment that is slightly off track on the issue of health insurance and the regime in place at the moment.  When anybody is admitted to hospital through accident and emergency, he or she is, by definition, vulnerable.  People are not admitted willy-nilly into accident and emergency.  A woman contacted me who ended up having a serious increase in her blood pressure, to the point where the consultant had to be called, because of the pressure put on her to fill out a form to say she was a private patient because she had health insurance when, in fact, she went in through accident and emergency as a consequence of ill-health.  The kind of pressure being put on people is absolutely outrageous.  They did not take account that it presented a problem for that woman that evening and they came back again the next morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700045#VV00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495042200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>They even wrote to her after she got out of hospital.

When patients are in a vulnerable position and are dependent on people to treat them, the last thing they want is to be having a row.

I also want to acknowledge the sincerity of the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in trying to deal with this issue.  The Government must take urgent action now to tackle exorbitant motor insurance costs as the situation is reaching crisis levels and leaving businesses, families and motorists struggling to make ends meet.  I have had many calls to my constituency office from people who are angry and frustrated, having been hit by 30% to 50% increases in motor and other insurance costs.  Many families are struggling to keep their heads above water.  They are paying mortgages, meeting exorbitant child care costs and paying other bills while trying to put food on the table.  The increases in insurance costs are putting extra pressure on already struggling families.<\/p>  <p>  This is an issue of particular concern in rural areas like my own constituency of Roscommon-Galway, where we have a very poor public transport system and so many people rely on their cars.  They need their cars to bring their children to school, to get to work and to do whatever work they have to do around the place.  A car is vital in rural Ireland.  I was contacted recently by a constituent whose car insurance had increased by 30% from &euro;560 in 2015 to over &euro;800 in 2017.  This is a person with absolutely no claims, whose car is about ten years old and is valued at &euro;2,000.  As he pointed out, he got &euro;5 back per week in his salary with the budgetary cuts to the USC but he is now faced with rising car insurance costs as well as the crippling cost of family health insurance.  He has no fear of anyone coming in through his front door to rob him when they can just do it through the letter box and that is what is happening.  Many businesses, particularly SMEs, are also experiencing massive increases, in the order of 40% and higher, in their motor, public liability and employer liability insurance premiums.  <\/p>  <p>  I know of a 19 year old girl with a full licence who has never been involved in a crash but the first insurance quotation she got was for &euro;6,000.  Her car is only worth &euro;2,800.  The driver of a wheelchair accessible taxi was quoted &euro;12,000.  A hotel in my constituency paid &euro;20,000 in insurance last year.  It made one small claim and now its insurance premium has increased to &euro;50,000.  We all know about the problems with health insurance and other areas of insurance too.  We need to address this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700046#WW00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1495042200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling this motion and for pursuing this matter relentlessly in this D&aacute;il.  The cost of insurance is causing a very real crisis across our country.  The rapid, unjustifiable and unsustainable increases in insurance costs are undermining our national competitiveness, crippling businesses and hurting families.  This is leading to widespread anger and anxiety in my own county of Wexford.  However, it is not just the increase in the principal that is causing distress.  Increases in excesses and the denial of claims for minor non-disclosures or for slight delays in notifying insurance companies of potential claims are all adding to distress.  Furthermore, we have seen significant increases in the number of drivers being refused car insurance three times.  In County Wexford, I have dealt with a number of instances where elderly women have been refused insurance for no reason other than their age, which is blatant discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  All these issues have been ongoing for some time now.  The increases in insurance premiums reflect a combination of Government imposed costs, poor regulation, mismanagement by insurance companies and legislative failure.  I do not get any sense of urgency from the Government to tackle this issue and we are not seeing any relief on the ground.  I am conscious of the requirement for parliamentary language so I will say that people rightly feel as if they are attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.<\/p>  <p>  The high cost of motor insurance is preventing people from going back to work as the insurance is often significantly higher than the price of a car.  Returning emigrants are being discriminated against with high insurance premiums.  Taxi and hackney drivers are going out of business due to the unaffordability of insurance and this in turn limits the ability of elderly people and people with disabilities to get around.  Some people are completely dependent on taxi and hackney services for mobility.  <\/p>  <p>  We have also seen significant increases being imposed on road hauliers.  Motor insurance is mandatory; it is a legal requirement and is not avoidable.  It acts as a flat charge in that it takes no account of ability to pay and as such, it affects the struggling classes more, including older people, young workers and families.  High insurance costs have a disproportionate effect on such people.  Spiralling business and motor insurance costs are undermining businesses.  In particular, increases in public and employer liability insurance are having a very negative effect on businesses in the services sector like hotels and restaurants.  I urge the Minister of State to start taking action on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700046#WW00300","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1495042200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I want to focus on the costs to businesses in an already difficult environment, particularly businesses in towns in rural and regional Ireland.  Businesses in our towns are already under huge pressure on a number of fronts because society has changed.  In particular, how we shop has changed, as have our demographics and our use of technology.  People now purchase more goods online, they commute longer distances and often pick up their groceries on the way home.  People engage in commercial activities in very different ways now so town centres and once thriving traditional market towns are struggling.  Businesses in town centres also have to contend with the difficulties caused by planning decisions which have led to the development of out-of-town centres and satellite centres.  This drives people out of the town centres and away from traditional businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rates has been well debated in this House recently.  In my county of Kildare we witnessed a huge commercial rate re-evaluation in recent months at the most inappropriate time, just as the country is coming out of recession and into some form of putative recovery.  Businesses are being kicked again, just when they were beginning to get back on their feet, by rates increases of between 300% and 400%.  In many cases, these increases are not linked in any way to an ability to pay, turnover or profitability.  Coupled with that, retail theft remains a huge issue.  The issues of crime, vagrancy and the lack of garda&iacute; as well as old-fashioned daylight robbery are unfortunately features of my constituency of Kildare North, where we have the lowest number of garda&iacute; per head of population.  Business are being hit again and again and have almost become resigned to it at this stage, having been held up time and again.  Brexit and the uncertainty that it brings has also been mentioned in this debate.  All these issues underscore why insurance costs are so pivotal in keeping the door open for many traditional, bricks and mortar, small businesses on the main streets of our towns.  These factors in combination mean that their competitiveness is taking a hammering.  They are trying to trade in the face of online and other forms of competition and are finding it increasingly difficult to keep the door open.  <\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to take on board the detailed motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, which contains some excellent points.  This issue needs urgent attention.  I heard the Minister of State on \"Morning Ireland\"  dealing with some of these issues and gamely trying to avoid dealing with other issues, which he succeeded in doing.  It is a very important motion which I commend to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700046#WW00400","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1495042200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>In tabling this motion, Fianna F&aacute;il wishes to highlight the crippling costs of insurance for home owners, individuals and businesses.  Motor insurance costs are putting immense pressure on households and businesses and for many SMEs, insurance costs have risen by 15% or more.  Motor insurance premiums are still on the rise despite assurances from the Government that people would see premiums start to fall as we progress through 2017.  While there are early signs of stability in the market, many worried motorists are still contacting me.  I was contacted by a taxi driver from Tramore who was setting up a new business, providing the first wheelchair accessible taxi in the lovely seaside town of Tramore, County Waterford.  He got an insurance quote for &euro;10,500, which almost put him out of business.  This man got up and set up a business but his insurance costs amount to &euro;200 per week, before he pays back any of his car loan or puts a drop of diesel into his vehicle.  The cost of insurance is having a huge effect on small businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that insurance costs are causing enormous difficulties for young people and I say that on the basis of personal experience.  My 24 year old son had a budget for a car and insurance of &euro;5,000.  Unfortunately, as insurance cost &euro;2,000, his car had to cost &euro;3,000.<\/p><p>If the insurance policy had cost &euro;1,000, he would have been able to buy a car for &euro;4,000.  The budget was there, but the cost of insurance determined the type of car he could buy.  That is exactly what we are listening to day in and day out.  Insurance companies do not want to insure younger or older drivers or taxi drivers.  They certainly do not to insure anyone with an older car.  That is making it very difficult.  An open market is needed to ensure fairness for all.  We have constantly highlighted the need for action by the Government at policy and legislative levels.  The Minister of State urgently needs to review the action points which should have been completed by now.  I ask him to do this.  I compliment my colleague on bringing this issue to the fore.  We are living with it day in and day out.  As I said, one appreciates the scale of the problem when one meets someone who tried to open a small business and insurance costs almost caused him or her to fail before he or she even started.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700046#WW00500","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495042800,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling the motion and thereby giving Deputies the opportunity to highlight the examples being raised with them by their constituents every day.  I thank the Deputies who helped us to gather information when we were putting together our report in the second half of last year.  The Government will oppose the motion not because we do not understand the genuine concerns of constituents but because the motion suggests nothing is being done.  That is unfair, given the amount of work that has been happening across many Departments for quite some time.  As an elected representative, I receive emails just like every other Deputy.  Ever since I took on this role, I have been receiving emails from all over the country.  We know that something needs to be done in this regard and that is exactly what we are trying to do.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Frank O'Rourke spoke about the data received from the CSO.  We discussed this issue recently in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  The statistics are relevant and we have to pay attention to them.  In the past five months we have seen no increase in motor insurance premiums.  In the past year we have seen a decrease, but that is not to suggest people are not still experiencing increases in their insurance premiums.  We know that they are.  Equally, I am not suggesting there is a direct correlation between the publication of the report earlier this year and the reforms under way as a result and the stabilisation in the insurance market.  As a result of the work done in the past 12 months by Deputies Michael McGrath, Pearse Doherty and Se&aacute;n Sherlock and their party colleagues - by all Members of this House, together with the Government - to draw attention to this issue, to find out exactly why this had come to pass and to set out a roadmap for the reforms to be introduced and as a result of the clarity being driven by that work, there is an understanding among the public at large, within the industry and among the vested interests in this area that change needs to happen.  It is clear from the reforms we are seeing that welcome change is happening.  I accept Deputy Michael McGrath's point that we do not have the data we need for employer's liability and public liability insurance.  That is something we need to fix.<\/p>  <p>  Co-operation is very important in dealing with this issue which, as we all know, is complex.  It is recognised in the Oireachtas committee's report and ours that there is no single silver bullet that will fix the problem.  We know that it cannot be solved overnight.  However, there is a comprehensive suite of reforms that can be actioned.  It is important to emphasise that we cannot give false hope to our constituents when they contact us by saying we are going to fix it immediately.  That would not be a responsible approach to this complex issue.  As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae pointed out, we need competition in the market.  We need a stable, properly functioning and competitive market if we are to drive down prices and ensure people in areas of business where they cannot get cover will be able to get it in the future.  It is important to bear that in mind as we work to address this issue.  While the clarity and sense of purpose we have shown in working together have been helpful, we risk undermining them if we are not careful in how we work together into the future as we implement these reforms.<\/p>  <p>  I dispute Deputy Dara Calleary's suggestion there has been a lack of urgency on the part of the Government.  Last year, when we set up the working group and began working on our reforms, we had subgroups meeting every week across the Government to look at the different areas that needed to be reformed.  When people were dissatisfied because our report was not due until December, we made a commitment to bring forward emerging recommendations by the end of October to help to inform the Oireachtas committee's report.  We met that commitment.  When we committed to quarterly reporting beginning later this year, the Taoiseach and the Oireachtas committee asked us to bring it forward and we did.  Prior to that, we produced an interim report before our quarterly report in order that when I appeared before the Oireachtas committee, as I did on a number of occasions, it had as much information as I had.  This facilitated a proper and constructive debate on these matters and enabled the committee to hold me to account in line with my role as the Minister of State with responsibility for this area.  We have brought transparency to the process in the way we have built the report.  We have set out clear timelines.  We have said which party will be responsible for implementing the various elements and actions mentioned in the report.  Where there are delays - I will come to them - we have signalled them.  Rather than saying \"we will do this in a year\" and then apologising a year later when it was not achieved and saying \"we will do it soon\", we have said quarter by quarter what steps will be taken.  We have put in place a traffic light reporting system to enable people to see in advance where delays might happen and allow us to work on fixing them.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Deputies who have claimed that work is not being done to look at the detail in the first quarterly report which states what is happening on each of the 33 recommendations.  The report we published in January set out 71 actions, 40 of which are to be completed this year.  That means that most of the recommendations will be acted on this year.  Ten actions were due for completion in the first quarterly report, but there have been delays in three areas.  We are working to address these delays, one of which will be fixed imminently, while work to fix the other two is ongoing.  We hope to address them before the end of the second quarter.  The Personal Injuries Commission which has been mentioned by a number of Deputies as one of the most important areas in the first quarterly report is already up and running and doing good and important work.  Good progress is being made with the national claims information database, another key element of our efforts to have transparency on what exactly is happening in the claims and insurance market.  We can take comfort from it.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been asked to speed up our work in areas such as the uninsured database.  We have to be very careful in that regard.  The last time an effort was made to implement an uninsured database, it failed because it is not easy to get the right data into the right system and make them easily accessible to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While we see the urgency in doing this, we have to proceed with caution to make sure we get it right and do not make a mistake that will ultimately make the system fatally flawed.  If we cause this proposal to be put back on the shelf, we might end up three years down the line with nothing to show for our endeavours.<\/p>  <p>  It has been suggested we have moved too slowly in the past year.  I have spoken about the urgency I have attached to incremental reporting on the work we have been doing.  It is important to recognise that we produced our report a few weeks after the Oireachtas committee had produced its report.  We had to do an added piece of work - we had to include an action plan with timelines to identify the responsible actors and get buy-in from them.  That is the responsibility of the Government.  We have done that.  I remind those who have said this should be done more quickly that we have prepared a detailed report which runs to over 100 pages and that we have done serious work on the timelines.  We recognise that work needs to be done in a number of areas at the same time.  I ask Deputies not to say we should do this more quickly.  As we have laid out in our report, we have had to resolve detailed issues in addressing the national claims information database.  How could we have done it more quickly?  I remind the House that other work needs to be done by the actors involved, including the Central Bank, across their various priority areas.  It is important that we make constructive contributions when we are talking about doing things more quickly.  Those who want things to be done more quickly are proposing in the motion before the House that more burdens be added to our work in new areas.  We have to recognise that significant resources are being invested across government to get this work done.<\/p>  <p>  We began our work on employer's and public liability insurance which is incredibly important at the start of this year.  It is important to recognise that a number of the reforms in the motor insurance area, such as those relating to the claims awards being made in the courts, are already being worked on by the Personal Injuries Commission and will feed into the reforms on employer's and public liability insurance.  I have been consulting stakeholders in this area, including hoteliers.  Deputy Tom Neville and others have brought detailed concrete information from their constituencies to help us to gain a proper understanding of this area.  We have consulted hoteliers, IBEC, ISME, RGDATA, Chambers Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  We have also received submissions from the IFA.  We are, therefore, aware of the complicated issues in this area.  I am worried about the increases in the excess figure being taken on by individual businesses.  I am very worried about the trend towards self-insurance.  I know that some businesses are withdrawing from particular parts of their activities.  For example, a hotel might take out a disco from its offering because it cannot afford the insurance.  This undermines the total offering of such businesses.<\/p>  <p>  We have received great information from businesses on what they believe is happening in respect of fraudulent claims and are trying to get harder data.  As we seek proper solutions in this area, we are going to encounter some serious constitutional issues in areas such as the Statute of Limitations and the burden of proof that has to be put on a business if it is to be possible for it to successfully defend a claim against it.  If a claim is made at the very end of the Statute of Limitations period of two years, a business might not have the necessary CCTV footage to hand, or it might not be able to contact its former employees who dealt with the issue at the time.  We have to try to address these issues, but it will not be easy.  It would not be responsible for me to say we will be able to get on top of the employer's and public liability aspects of this issue in the morning.  Constitutional issues require serious consultation across the House in conjunction with the Attorney General.  We are potentially looking at trying to get difficult legislation through the House.  We need to make sure businesses can avail of more competition in the market.  We know that people are moving out of particular areas in a way that is fundamentally undermining the operation of their businesses into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The practice of insurance companies using non-disclosure where it would have no bearing on a decision by an insurer to price cover at a particular level is raised in the motion.  I agree that it is unacceptable for it to be used as the sole purpose for avoiding payment.  Deputy Pearse Doherty has proposed some very constructive legislation in this area.  We want to work on it, but it is a resource issue.  We need to get to it at the right time in the committee in order that we can deal with it in an effective manner and see it through.<\/p><p> Regarding the timelines within which we hope to report on the next phase of employer's and public liability insurance cost reforms, I want to provide as much clarity as I can, but we are reviewing what we hope to do.  The intention at the beginning of the year was to have an addendum to the motor insurance report because so many issues crossed from the area of motor insurance into employer's and public liability insurance.  I have had an addendum published to the existing report, but increasingly as we work on the issue of employer's and public liability insurance, we see further areas in the motor insurance sector on which we want to update data.  It might be the case that in September this year we will bring forward a more comprehensive report with new parts on employer's and public liability insurance.  Because I anticipate some significant legal and constitutional issues in the near term, I hope in July to give a very clear indication of the direction I would like to take and go to the Oireachtas committee to get its support in order that we can go about addressing these issues as quickly as we can.<\/p> <p> Deputy Lisa Chambers has spoken about the fact that her motor insurance premium is more expensive now than when she started to drive ten years ago.  We must recognise that in the early 2000s premiums were unsustainably low.  It was a failure of the business model at the time and we are now dealing with its correction.  We need to move away from these super cycles in which insurance cover is priced too low and then too high.  That is part of the work we are doing.  Good work has already been done in that regard when we consider the solvency II related legislation.<\/p> <p> I will shortly be appearing before the Oireachtas committee when I would like to go into more detail on the issues raised in the quarterly report and return to some of the questions raised in this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700047#XX00200","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495043400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his co-operation.

Action needs to be taken to address them to take the financial pressure off households.  We have seen car insurance premiums rise for no apparent reason.  People who own a car that is more than ten years old have struggled to have it insured.  Returning emigrants who may have driven in Australia or Britain where motorists drive on the same side of the road as we do have also seen a dramatic increase in their motor insurance premiums.<\/p>  <p>  There is a complete lack of competition in the insurance market in seeking cover for vans and motorbikes.  Elderly drivers are being pushed out of the motor insurance market purely because of their age.  They are almost being forced to stop driving which would have a dramatic impact on an older person's life.  The number of people who have been declined insurance cover has increased dramatically from 178 in 2012 to 1,914 last year.  This morning I spoke to a constituent in Cork who had moved house across his estate and was parking his car on the opposite side of the same green and who had seen his motor insurance premium increase from &euro;900 to &euro;1,200. <\/p>  <p>  Last summer Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a similar motion with constructive proposals to address spiralling insurance costs.  It was six months before the working group came forward with many of the same proposals.  Clear targets were set, with 40 to be met this year.  However, the quarter one report shows that three of the ten action points have not been finalised.  That does not show a lack of urgency but that the Government was coming late to addressing the issue and that it has fallen behind.  It needs to show more urgency to drive forward on the issue to which tt is coming late.  Businesses are also falling behind, but I will leave it to my colleagues to address that aspect.  The Government needs to show greater urgency and support for families by driving down insurance costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700048#YY00500","speaker":"1284"},{"type":"speech","time":1495043400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing forward the motion and giving us the opportunity to highlight the issue.  I listened to the Minister of State intently.  In part, the motion was brought forward to enable us as an Opposition party to do our duty by holding the Government to account as the insurance business affects people's lives.  The cost of insurance impacts on households, individuals and businesses and is crippling people.  As Deputy Eugene Murphy said, it is impacting on people who are going out to work and those living in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  When Deputy Michael McGrath tabled the motion last week, I put it up on Facebook.  It is one of the few political motions I have posted and it received traction it Australia among emigrants who were thinking of returning home.  They have received insurance quotes of approximately &euro;5,800.  There are skill shortages across the country and they have skills we need.  We are targeting them, but they are focusing on what would it cost them to re-establish themselves here and the cost of insurance is a factor.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about meeting those involved in the sector.  A few months ago I spoke about a business located on the banks of the River Shannon.  It involves a pub and a restaurant.  Last year it received an insurance quote of &euro;7,500.  Because it had made a small claim, it was unable to get a quote elsewhere.  There are only three providers in the market who will provide this insurance cover, as the Minister of State is well aware.  The premium increased from &euro;7,500 to &euro;50,000 which following long discussions the business had reduced to &euro;15,500.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not acceptable for the Minister of State to reject the motion merely because we are holding the Government to account.  Three out of ten action points have not yet been completed.  It is our role as an Opposition party to hold the Government to account.  We told the people that we would be a voice for them and I was hoping we could all continue to work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700048#YY00600","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1495043400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I have not come into the House to be repetitive.  My colleagues, led by Deputy Michael McGrath, have clearly highlighted the crippling effect of rising home, motor and business insurance costs, together with the undermining of our competitiveness.  I wish to refer specifically to the undue pressure placed on community groups and the voluntary officer boards associated with them.  Most Deputies have had some involvement with voluntary and community organisations throughout Ireland and will know first-hand about the issues to which I will refer.<\/p>  <p>  I was glad when the case taken by a hillwalker in County Wicklow against the Office of Public Works was thrown out of court.  There are increasing worries and concerns about the litigious nature of society which is affecting football clubs, Tidy Town groups, scout and guide groups, just to mention a few, all of which have been impacted on by the extortionate and exorbitant hike in insurance costs.  People fear that the risks for organisations are too great and, as a consequence, are becoming concerned about the level of their personal exposure.  The Public Participatory Network, PPN, which represents the community and voluntary sector in each local authority area is seriously concerned about the exposure of voluntary organisations because of the risk involved in terms of personal liability, particularly in properties such as community halls, on playing pitches and in various other places.  I highlight the fact that many of these excellent voluntary organisations are picking up the slack for many Departments.  Tidy Town groups are a case in point.  In these instances the cost of public liability insurance should be covered by public bodies where works are agreed to with local authorities to enhance the environment and properties generally in the charge of local authorities.  Insurance costs have become so prohibitive for community employment and other public schemes that the employers, namely, community employment and Pobal management committees which are voluntary are finding themselves with depleted and, in many instances, no surplus funds to manage valuable projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700048#YY00700","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1495043400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath on bringing forward the motion.  To be fair to him, he has championed this issue for many years both inside and outside the House.  The contributions highlight the seriousness of the issue and the geographical spread of the Deputies raising the issue shows that it is not isolated to one particular pocket of the country.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the Government established a working group late last year to examine the issue, but it was late in coming to the game and acknowledging the problem in the insurance market.  As a party, we published recommendations early last year and the main difference between our recommendations and those of the working group is that ours were made about 12 months earlier.<\/p>  <p>  Listening to the concluding remarks of the Minister of State and to him on Radio 1 earlier, he seemed somewhat content that the figures of the Central Statistic Office, CSO, showed that renewal premiums were static.  That is not good enough.<\/p><p>It is welcome that premiums are static but it comes on the back of an increase of 11% in 2014, of over 30% in 2015 and 12% in 2016.  The progress report for the first quarter of this year indicates that three of the ten items have yet to be fully implemented.  The Minister of State indicated the working group involving owners of small public vehicles has yet to meet and I understand the taxi federation has not been invited to such a meeting.  It is critical those people are invited to that meeting.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State has heard many examples from my colleagues and I could add to them.  There is a lady with 20 years of claims-free driving who has seen her insurance go from &euro;400 to approximately &euro;800.  I know a man who drives a van as the second family vehicle.  The family is into sports such as triathlons, and it has bikes and surfboards.  He cannot get insurance for the van because it is not being operated commercially.  We have seen insurance for companies increase by a huge amount over the past number of months and years.  The recommendations are there and the Minister of State has said he wants us to acknowledge that he has established this group.  He will not acknowledge that he is not affording this the priority it deserves.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State asks what can we do faster.  We know the minority Government in this D&aacute;il means there is a lack of legislation going through this Oireachtas over the past year.  Why not prioritise the legislation that will give effect to proposals in this report.  The Minister of State argues we cannot give false hope to constituents, and we should not do so, but we should say to them that while we cannot decrease premiums this year, we will accelerate the recommendations in the report and the legislative proposals arising from it to ensure that next year, they will not be crippled by the high cost of insurance.  The Minister of State has sat on his hands for too long.  I ask him to accept this Private Members' motion in the spirit in which we put it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700048#YY00800","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495044000,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1495044000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 18 May 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1495044000,"counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1495044000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment has completed its consideration of the Minerals Development Bill 2015 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016: Order for Report Stage","time":1495044000,"counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1495044000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1495044000,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016: Report Stage","time":1495044000,"counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1495044000,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Before beginning, I seek the agreement of the House for amendment No. 97 to be taken out of group 10 and put into group 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ01000","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1495044000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This is a Bill of major significance, as I know the Minister of State, Deputy English, and his officials know.  At its heart is putting into effect one of the central recommendations of the Mahon tribunal into planning and zoning corruption.  I would have thought, given the significance of the final reading of the Bill tonight, we should have had the principal Minister in front of us, given some of the issues we will raise.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 85 are essentially related to the same matter, which I have referred to at length on Second and Committee Stages.  I have a very real concern that parts of this legislation and the other amendment we made to the principal Act in last December's planning and development Bill are not in line with either the Aarhus Convention or the 2014 environmental impact assessment directive.  My understanding is yesterday was the deadline for the transposition of the 2014 directive and we have missed the deadline as we have not transposed the directive.  If the Minister of State has new information on that, I would be happy to hear it.  I also understand the Department is considering transposing the directive by way of regulations.  One of the problems with that is whereas it might mean this will not be delayed further than it has already, we will have less opportunity to scrutinise the regulations as they would only be laid before the House rather than passed as primary legislation.  Given the importance of the directive and the length of time - three years - we have been waiting for it to be transposed, it is a real shame.<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State will not support amendment No. 1, which is really an opportunity to say that notwithstanding the fact the officials and the Minister believe the Act is in compliance with the directives and convention, we would like further scrutiny.  The purpose of the amendment is to oblige the Minister to lay before the House a report at a set date to outline compliance.  Amendment No. 85 is very clearly an attempt to insert into the environmental impact assessment, EIA, screening process a much more rigorous requirement for public scrutiny at the pre-screening stage rather than once an EIA has been required.  My clear view is this is required under Article 6.4 of the Aarhus Convention and I will press amendment No. 85.<\/p><p>I will put up my hand and admit amendment No. 78 is not very well drafted and I will not press it today.  The purpose of putting it on the table is to raise an issue of concern.  I will ask the Minister and his officials to go away, whether it is in the context of this legislation or subsequent regulations, and examine the concern.  Specifically, this relates to unauthorised developments, particularly in areas where an EIA or an appropriate assessment, AA, is required, and in cases where the EIA or AA was not secured at the outset, retention planning permission could not be applied for.  In principle, that is the correct approach, particularly to ensure that people who have deliberately and wilfully breached EIA or AA requirements are not able to get a second chance.  There are some anomalies in the system and I have met officials to outline some of those.  I hope I will hear from the Minister of State a commitment arising from recognition of the issue, and that whatever is the most appropriate way can be followed in a particular timescale.  That could be through regulation or primary legislation as I am open to all of that.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 82 deals with the relationship between the EIA screening process and planning permission extensions.  I am trying to achieve two goals.  The first is to give the planning authorities the opportunity to refuse an application for extension.  I am also seeking to ensure that if the material, developmental and environmental circumstances differ between an original planning permission and an extension, an EIA could be required at that time.  It makes no sense to give somebody planning permission without an EIA and then automatically assume, ten years on, for example, there are no changes in the environment that may require an EIA in the view of the planning authority.<\/p><p>In this sense it is to give the planning authority the options which are not available in the current legislation.<\/p> <p> Amendments Nos. 1 and 85 relate to the Aarhus Convention and the transposition of EIA Directive 2014\/52\/EU; while amendment No. 78 relates to the planning anomalies in the retention of unauthorised developments in respect of EIA or AA requirements.  Amendment No. 82 involves a requirement to consider in a more rounded way the need for EIAs where planning permission extensions are being secured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700049#ZZ01200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1495044600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I strongly support Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin's amendment on the need for us to have a report within at least six months on the Government's compliance with the European Union's environmental impact assessment directives and the Aarhus Convention.  This issue has been drawn to my attention in recent weeks by environmental groups, specifically the Woodland League.  I know that others are also very concerned about it.  I had a discussion with some of the departmental officials before we came into the House about the number of cases pending against Ireland for breaches of the EIA directives and there seemed to be some debate about how many there were.  I read an article recently in which it was suggested there were 15, including five at what was called the second phase.  That may or may not be true and I see the officials shaking their heads.  We will come back to that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have the command of the detail that others outside this House might have, but the point made to me about the landslide at Derrybrien, where a mountain collapsed after a windfarm had been built there, was that a case had been brought against Ireland because the developers and the planning authorities had failed to ensure proper compliance with the EIA directives.  Subsequently, there were court cases, but the ruling was that we had failed to comply.  Afterwards, as I understand it, a new concept was brought forward - substitute consent - to give retrospective permission, as in a retention order, for developments that were illegal and that did not fully comply with the EIA directives.  In the case of Derrybrien I have legal letters which suggest that, even with the substitute consent required afterwards, the EIA directives were not fully complied with, particularly in respect of public consultation.  At the heart of the original problem was the failure to comply with the requirement for public consultation and an EIA.  The same was true of the substitute consent, which in itself is dodgy because it involves the retention of something that should never have happened.  In this case it led to an environmental disaster.  The new concept retrospectively legitimises stuff that was illegal and breached the EIA directives.  In the case of Derrybrien, even the processes involved in seeking substitute consent were not complied with in murky circumstances.  I do not have time to go into all of the details on this point, but it merits proper debate and I will submit parliamentary questions about it.<\/p>  <p>  The State and semi-State companies are planning major infrastructural developments such as contentious windfarms and other renewable energy projects, but we have not fully transposed the EIA directives into domestic legislation.  We have dodgy concepts such as substitute consent to try to cover our tracks and allow these developments go ahead without full compliance.  Do not get me wrong - I am very much in favour of renewable energy projects, but big windfarms are very contentious.  There are real issues about whether communities are being consulted and about the environmental impacts which were disastrous in the case of Derrybrien.  This area needs to be seriously scrutinised.  Apart from anything else, we could be subject to major fines, but these are controversial issues in terms of the impact on communities, engaging in proper public consultation and a proper assessment of the potential damage to the environment.  There are big questions about the way we do things and suggestions that where the State or semi-State companies are doing things, there is a nod and a wink culture to get stuff through and ride roughshod over local communities and best practice that seeks to ensure the environment is not damaged.  <\/p>  <p>  For all of these reasons, the amendment is terribly important.  We need a detailed report on the issue and a very detailed discussion and debate in this House which should be well flagged to give environmental groups and those with knowledge an opportunity to feed into the debate before it happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700050#AAA00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1495044600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>It is welcome that amendment No. 85 specifies what form the consultation should take.

I have never seen a planning application with an associated EIA which argued against the development.

That merits consideration on another day.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of amendment No. 82, if an EIA is required for a housing development, who makes the decision if it includes over 100 houses?

One could be forgiven for suspecting that the leadership contest is more important than this Bill.  It could be a very important one, if things were done right.  Clearly, the Minister is eager to avoid trips and falls between now and 2 June.  I have a lot of respect for him, but he has made a dog's dinner of dealing with the housing crisis.  Things are worse now than they were a year ago.  There have been very few improvements anywhere along the line.  Homes are not going up but prices are.  The Government is partially responsible for this and the Minister holds a certain responsibility if he is to allow the Department to behave in the manner it is behaving.<\/p>  <p>  Cairn Homes and Hines Ireland control over half of the sites in the Dublin area.  They have a vested interest in not building and it makes sense for them not to build.  They will build bugger all in the next year or year and a half.  They will build when prices have increased further.  The decisions the Minister has taken are driving up prices and amount to a subsidy for developers.  Builders are interested in building.  It is not that there is no one to build; rather, developers have a vested interest in not building now, especially those who have sites.  They are land bankers.  Every time the price of housing goes up by 10%, the value of the sites on which developers are sitting goes up by a minimum of 30%.  The Government can do the maths, but I can give it a breakdown of the figures.  Developers would be off their heads to build because of the way the system is operating.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government will have to cop onto itself and start building houses.  I am not asking local authority members to go out with picks and shovels and start building, but local authorities could employ builders who are not looking for a profit margin of &euro;15,000 per unit.  Some would be very happy if they cleared &euro;5,000 on every house they built, but a developer is a different animal.  The Government appears to think things will never happen unless the big boys are involved, but they do not want to build now because a climate has been created in which it does not make sense for them to build.  The State has an incredible amount of land on which to build.  Members of the housing committee asked Mr. Dick Brady why local authorities did not have CPO land on which to build in order to get things going.  He said there was no reason in the wide earthly world to use CPOs because the State had loads of land.  He told us that there was planning permission for over 20,000 units and that there was permission for multiples of that figure in zoned areas.  We are now considering giving land to developers in order to encourage them to build on it.  Hines Ireland and Cairn Homes alone control over half of the sites in Dublin.  Why will the Government not start building social and affordable housing?  I do not understand its rationale.  It is neoliberal thinking.  The Government seems to be bogged down in the notion that only the private sector can deliver housing.<\/p>  <p>  It is a case of organising builders.  It is not true to say they are not available.  I know loads of builders who would love to build but cannot access finance or sites.  The Government could employ them to build housing units to get things moving.  It is a failed policy.  To whom is the Government listening?  Is it listening to the lobbyists such as Cairn Homes, Hines Ireland and the CIF?  It should listen to the geography department in Maynooth which makes a rational case for how the Government should operate, but that is not what it is doing.  The English, as they now know, have made incredible mistakes in this area.  They are not addressing them properly, but we can learn from them.  However, we are not doing so.<\/p>  <p>  I understand why the Minister is not in the House.  He was a very impressive Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and did an excellent job.  He is a very capable man, one for whom I have a lot of respect, but he is not doing a good job in housing provision.  For some reason or other, whether it be ideological or that he is listening to the wrong people, he is going in the wrong direction.  At this stage, I can only assume that things will get worse before they get better, unless the Government chooses to take a different path.  This is not rocket science.  We have many problems in how we supply housing in Ireland, be it private, social, affordable or rental.  We are snowed under, but the problems can be fixed.  While nothing can be fixed overnight, we could start, but we are not doing that and I do not understand why.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700051#BBB00100","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1495045200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I, too, regret the fact that the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is not present.
