I want to update the Seanad that at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning we decided to invite representatives of the HSE to a meeting next Tuesday to examine care home settings.  I am sure all Oireachtas Members are welcome to attend.  I advise the House about the meeting because we should have more people debating the issue.  Early in the new year the committee plans to meet individuals, organisations and groups on the issue in order to have a wider and more proactive discussion about systemic issues, not just in &Aacute;ras Attracta, and to provide recommendations and guidance.  I would like to see the capacity legislation and advocacy service legislation progressed.  I would also like to look at the potential role of the Human Rights and Equality Commissioner and the Ombudsman in order to see where those roles would be appropriate.<br\/>I raised the following issue in the Seanad a month ago and know that many Senators concur with my viewpoint on the issue of Childline and its funding.  As we approach Christmas its funding situation is becoming more desperate.  Childline has conducted a very public fundraising campaign for a vital listening service.  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>has run several articles this week on the importance of Childline's work and added to the voices calling on the Government to find a way to ensure the night service does not close down.  Childline's night service is staffed.  The majority of Childline's services are provided by  volunteers but one cannot expect volunteers who have other jobs to staff the night time service.  We also know that night time, by its very nature night time, is made up of the darkest hours.  Are we saying that when a child picks up the courage to pick up a phone and say &quot;I need help&quot; that we will respond with &quot;Please call back at a time that better suits us&quot;?  <br\/>Childline deals with issues of child abuse and neglect but it also deals with everyday  issues such as loneliness.  I have heard that children have telephoned Childline just to hear an adult be present in their lives.  A volunteer told me that one Christmas Day a child rang because he wanted somebody else there when opening a present.  Bullying is another issue which we have talked about here in the House.  Who is a child supposed to reach out to if he or she is not getting help at home?  Who does a child turn to when he or she needs help or guidance?  Such children work up the courage to pick up the phone and call Childline.<br\/>I ask the Leader to convey to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste the urgency of this issue because the service will close.  On previous occasions Senators have come together as a Seanad on the issue of Childline and the missing children's hotline.  This is an essential service if we really want to ensure that children's voices are heard and we that we do not say to them to call back at a more convenient time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100003#B01500","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418294400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The word &quot;torture&quot; has been invoked this morning in the case of Irish prisoners and torture was used in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  A much worse condition was discussed in the House and attempts were made to rectify it.  I am talking about so-called rendition flights.  Members present will recall that I consistently raised the issue.  For the first time in history, a special committee of Seanad &Eacute;ireann was established to investigate it, but it was collapsed as a result of the intervention of Fianna F&aacute;il councillors from Shannon.  They were concerned about their jobs, but we now have the proof that it was torture.  Diane Feinstein who compiled the report of over 6,000 pages after seven years of considered investigation said it was definitively torture in any meaning of the word, but this was denied to our ambassador.  President Obama said, &quot;One of the things that sets us apart from other countries is that when we make mistakes, we admit them.&quot;  Let us hear it in the case of rendition flights and the bombing of groups of people without warning using drone aircraft, which happens every day.  What happened to the rule of law, <i>habeas corpus<\/i>and the right to a defence for civilians?  Americans can just choose who they want to blast off the face of the earth, but these are not the values for which I stand as a western politician.  They do not represent the ordinary decent people of Europe, America and the West generally.  Despite the fact that the former Polish President, Mr. Kwasniewski, has admitted to the presence of black sites in Poland, our wonderful Department of Justice and Equality has admitted that what it calls a small number of commercially leased aircraft that have been involved in legitimate commercial activity may also have been involved.  We know that the Government and the Civil Service are not very good at arithmetic.  Is 200 instances a small number of aeroplanes, the registration numbers of which are known?  Were there continuous circuits of rendition flights whereby people were delivered to externalised torture sources?<br\/>What was the nature of this torture and what were its results?  The results so far are completely meaningless.  Not one fragment of useful information has been accessed by the CIA as a result of this disgraceful breach of international law.  The Republicans have claimed useful information was obtained, but there is not one case among the 20 serious cases examined by Senator Feinstein.  They suggested they had obtained information on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, but this is another lie, just like the lies told to us by the previous Government and the Department of Justice and Equality.<br\/>I invited the President, Michael D Higgins, to a meeting with the then Garda Commissioner.  He told us one thing, while the Government told us another and they never reconciled.  I made a complaint to the Garda Commissioner and asked for it to be investigated, but garda&iacute; never went on board the aeroplanes, saying there was no evidence.  From where do we get the evidence, except on board the aeroplanes?  We have the aeroplane numbers and flight plans.  Everyone knew and this country was deliberately complicit in the torture, arrest and detention of the people concerned.  We know that one person died, having been chained to concrete outside in freezing temperatures.  The person responsible should be held up on a charge of murder if we are to believe the American President.  One man was in such pain that he chewed off part of his arm.  They attempted rectal feeding and, after forced rectal feeding, the recipient of torture tried to chew off his arm.  <br\/>These are the things we are confronting.  Are these western values?

Its rental index shows an increase of 10% in rents in the Dublin area and there is a recognition that rents have been increasing outside Dublin by a significant proportion.  This, therefore, is no longer a Dublin problem, as it has extended all over the country.  I expected the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill in the House before Christmas, but we have not yet seen it.  Where do we stand on it?  I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, on the additional funding for emergency beds and his guarantee that no one will be without a bed between now and Christmas.  He has recognised the importance of protecting people in their homes by extending the tenancy protection service to Cork where it is recognised that it is way beyond an issue for Dublin and surrounding counties only.  It is extending to other large urban areas.  I would like to have a debate in the House on the issue of rent regulation.  As long as rents continue to rise, no matter what the Government does, we will see people being pushed out of their homes because they simply cannot afford to remain within them.

It is insidious and I see a parallel between the physical and psychological abuse of vulnerable persons at the &Aacute;ras Attracta centre in County Mayo and the torture of detainees by CIA interrogators.  Recent revelations in both cases raise the question of how widespread was the abuse.  The CIA used poorly trained, non-vetted personnel and deployed individuals without the relevant training or experience.  Detainees were subjected to the most aggressive techniques, stripped naked, diapered, physically struck and put in various painful stress positions for long periods.  RTE and &quot;Prime Time&quot; have done us a favour, as has Diane Feinstein, the senior Senator in California and the most senior Senator in the United States.  I do not like to mention people's ages, but she is 81 years old, having been born in 1933.  I have met her a number of times.  She had the courage, as Senator David Norris said, to keep at it and speak out, despite pressure and everyone else being in denial about the treatment of detainees.  The United States and Ireland are looking at themselves on both issues.  Where are the morals and values of the people concerned?  As far as I could see on the television, there were Irish people mistreating vulnerable persons.  Where are our national values?  If it is supposed to be fabulous in getting the economy back in place, these personal compassionate values are far more important.  The Celtic tiger in Ireland drove them out of many.  We never heard as much about profit, money and material success as we did then and we are now paying the price.

This issue must be nailed down and watertight in order that the position cannot be changed in the future.<\/p><p>I also want to mention the issue raised by Senator Kelly.  A debate should be arranged on how protests are organised, particularly those held during the working week.  While I acknowledge and accept the right of anybody to engage in peaceful protest, it is not right that people should be severely discommoded while going about their daily business or trying to get to hospital appointments.  Last night, I spoke to a woman who spent an hour and a quarter in a taxi on her way to hospital.  The journey cost &euro;45 instead of the normal &euro;15.  The taxi driver told her that while he did not like water charges, his income had been severely reduced yesterday.  It is not right that people's livelihoods were affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100005#D00800","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1418295000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>On a point of order, none of that would have occurred if the Government had approached the water issue correctly in the first place.

If figures published in Britain today had been available, the debate would have been even better, especially if the figures correspond to the position in Ireland.  They show that half of people in the United Kingdom take a prescription drug every day and one in five British people take free prescription drugs every day.  The danger is the lack of certainty about whether the issue can be controlled.<\/p><p>One aspect of the discussion on medicines that the House did not have an opportunity to raise last week was the problem of misprescribing as a result of poor handwriting on prescriptions from doctors, who are not known for good handwriting.  In some parts of the world, it is estimated that one in 15 prescriptions is incorrectly dispensed because the medicines are misidentified in the pharmacy.  Bar codes have been introduced to avoid this problem.  It is worthwhile to draw the Minister's attention to this issue, although I doubt we will have another debate on it so soon after last week's discussion.<\/p><p>On Palestine, I was concerned about a newspaper report mistakenly indicating that last month's Seanad vote on recognition of Palestine was unanimous.  Some Senators indicated that we should take the rights of Israel into account and provide some balance on the issue.  It is necessary that I confirm this was the case.  While the House should by all means identify Palestine as having a right to exist, the Palestinians should identify that Israel also has a right to exist.  When one reads about what took place in Northern Ireland and how long it took to reach agreement there - work is still being done on the issue - it serves as a reminder of how difficult it is to reach agreement in disputed areas.

It is intolerable, in a civilised society, that domestic abuse should take place and for children to be involved.  It is such a sensitive issue.  This Government has been signalling over the last few months that it has more money in the kitty than in previous years.  It is doling it out, particularly coming up to Christmas, by introducing Supplementary Estimates across various Departments.  It is incumbent on any Government, but particularly this one, to find the necessary funding to ensure that Childline's night-time service is maintained.<\/p><p>One has only to think of any one child.  Let us not talk in multiples, because sometimes a person gets lost in that.  Let us talk about just one child, a child the Senators might know, who may or may not be subject to abuse in his or her home.  We do not know.  I was thinking about those vile people - that is all they are - in Mayo who abused patients with special needs or who are mentally challenged.  What sort of attitude do they have to their children in their own homes?  We do not know.  However, on the evidence of what I saw there, I would have serious concerns.  If that is the attitude they adopt towards poor, vulnerable people - if they treat them like animals - perhaps there is something else going on.  That is what I kept thinking about, in terms of supporting this view across the House.  Senator van Turnhout, of all the Members of this House, is probably the person who is most familiar with and experienced in this because of her background in the Children's Rights Alliance.<\/p><p>It is incumbent on the Deputy Leader to convey to the Government the need to urgently fund the Childline service and to ensure that the night-time service continues.  There was a quote from the Taoiseach that was recently used to bolster this argument.  He spoke about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, paraphrasing the Proclamation of 1916.  There is no excuse for this from a Government that has an extra &euro;2 billion as a result of the EUROSTAT statistics being changed over the last couple of months.  There is an extra &euro;2 billion in real money.  <\/p><p>One Childline worker said on the radio earlier this week that the Government could find a couple of million euros for the museums of this country but could not find a measly few thousand euros for the children of this country.  I am not sure that I would necessarily agree with the parallel she drew, because it is important that our cultural institutions are funded properly.  However, this is not the old argument of either-or.  It is not a case of saying we could build more schools and more hospitals if we were to take money away from some other sector.  That is not the way the Government works.  There is a need.  I ask the Deputy Leader to address this issue.<\/p><p>I support Senator Quinn in the comments he made about the need for balance in debates on the Middle East in this House.  It is not all about Palestine being good and Israel being bad.  An indication, perhaps, is the interventions of Senator Norris.  He is the very man who would defend the right of people to express their opinions freely outside this House.  He should also adopt the view that they are entitled to express their opinions within this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100006#E00800","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1418295600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Can I confirm that I completely accept people's right to express their opinions?

I sincerely hope this will be the last Christmas in which people will suffer in direct provision centres.  However, those people who run the direct provision centres will have a great Christmas because recent media reports suggest they are making an absolute fortune.  I ask the Deputy Leader to request the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to carry out an investigation to ascertain exactly the degree or level of profits these concerned are making.  Much has been privatised with which I do not agree and for example, I refer to the shambolic mess that was made of privatising Eircom.  However, privatising the treatment of human beings is a completely different matter.

Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow and Mary's Meals were worthy recipients of that award and Members nominated them because of the fantastic work they are doing in 13 countries in the developing world.  They provide more than 920,000 daily meals in a school setting to severely impoverished children.  Feeding a child in a school setting will both encourage the parents to send the child to school and will help the child to do better at school.  Hopefully, this then will give him or her a gateway out of extreme poverty.  Members rightly talk about the challenges our own country faces at this time and rightly celebrate the great people who are doing so much with the homeless and in other areas at this time.  Moreover, they rightly deplore the wrongs inflicted on vulnerable members of society, as has been seen in recent days.  However, one must never forget that so many problems are global and the need to show human solidarity is a global need.  That is why the Human Dignity Group honoured Mary's Meals today and I thank colleagues for their great support for this inaugural award and hopefully, it was the first of many such awards that will be given from the Human Dignity Group in this House.<\/p><p>I spoke briefly in the debate last night about the terrible revelations in &Aacute;ras Attracta, Swinford.  One irony I noted was that Swinford is one place in which families who have children affected by autism are discovering the potential of the rapid prompting method, RPM.  This method has enabled children with autism to communicate their feelings for the first time, which is a really liberating experience.  Most of what one saw happen in &Aacute;ras Attracta would not have happened had people been in a position to communicate effectively with their families.  Sadly, that is not always possible but in the case of children and adults who can now express their thoughts through RPM to perhaps communicate the terror they once endured because they were treated as having lower cognition when they had not, the State needs to support and encourage this and to provide resources in this regard.  I know Seosamh &Oacute; L&aacute;imh&iacute;n, a young man who is affected by autism who is not in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  However, when asked recently how he felt before he could express himself through RPM, he spelled the word &quot;terrified&quot; on the computer.  When asked how he feels now that he can express itself, he uses the word &quot;liberated&quot;.  It is similarly hard to imagine what residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta must have felt and as a society, we must work hard to restore ethical non-oppressive care in the treatment of persons with severe intellectual disability and in care homes.  I wished to note again in this forum, as I did last night, the irony that the investigation has taken place in the same town in which families are pioneering a new and positive approach.  I hope the Department of Education and Skills and the Health Service Executive will take on board the potential of RPM.<\/p><p>Finally, I support Senator Conway's comments on direct provision.  It appears to me as though people undoubtedly are profiteering on a large scale.  I have no problem with people making profits but it must not be at the expense of there being a high equivalent standard across the country for any person or family who is in the direct provision system.  As long as the State is paying, whether directly providing the facilities or paying others to do so, one cannot be without a minimum set of required standards that would include things like families and people having access to their own door key in order that they have their own quarters and are not forced or confined to be living with people for indefinite periods or to be in the same room with people they do not even know.

My one question, which the Deputy Leader might put to the Minister as something that would form part of any inquiry, is to establish in some way why staff acted like that.  It is unbelievable that so many coalesced in that and as to why the staff acted like that, I heard someone on \"Morning Ireland\" suggest they simply were there for too long.  However, feedback in this respect will be important to ensure this culture will never be repeated.  The question on everyone's mind at present is, in how many other places is this going on?

Senator Daly also raised a number of other issues and I am sure there will be quite a range of issues discussed under those headings and beyond that as part of the talks.  However, as all Members are aware, matters are at a critical point in respect of seeing the continuation of the Stormont institutions and it is critical that those talks proceed smoothly and achieve a resolution.  In common with Senator Daly, I already have welcomed the Government decision on the hooded men case.  I note it was responding to the European Court of Human Rights, not the European Union court and one should be careful in this regard.<\/p> <p>I will pass over the Senator's range of other comments on the Government, given that there was a certain degree of selective amnesia in that regard.  <\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the Belfast talks and wished all parties involved well.  He has also pointed out that up to now agreement has alluded them and we very much hope this will change.  <\/p><p>The Senator also spoke about the Finance Bill.  As we will be debating the Bill today, I will not come on it further.<\/p><p>Senator Jillian van Turnhout spoke about the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme on &Aacute;ras Attracta and commented on the debate last night with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  She also informed the House, for which I thank her, that representatives of the HSE would appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children next Tuesday to debate the issue and reminded us that any Member of either House could attend such a committee hearing.  I welcome the news that the committee will be taking up the issue.  As stated by the Senator, these are systemic issues.  A number of issues arise from the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme.  One of interest to me as a member of the justice committee is the capacity legislation, on which that committee conducted hearings and published a report some time ago.  I will seek an update on its progress, as it seems to be stuck somewhere in the system.  <\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of funding for Childline, on which she was supported by many colleagues.  She has pointed out that there is a real danger that the night service Childline offers may be closed and reminded us of the poignant and sad stories of children who seek the support of Childline at night and how important it is that they receive that support.  She asked that I raise the issue with the Government and I will be happy to do so.  Given the level of support across the House, I am happy to work with her in drafting a motion to which the Seanad as a whole could sign up.  That would give more strength to the issue than my writing to the Taoiseach about it.  Perhaps we might in short course get together to draft such a motion with a view to sending it to the Government early next week.  As stated by the Senator, there is a precedent in this regard in the case of other issues.  It would show the real strength of the Seanad if we were to put forth a cross-party motion on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100007#F01900","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418296800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I will circulate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100008#G00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418296800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The Senator might circulate the wording by e-mail and the group leaders could then check to ensure their members sign up to it.<\/p><p>Senator David Norris raised the issue of the brutal interrogation techniques used by the CIA, as revealed by Senator Diane Feinstein in her report for the Senate Intelligence Committee.  I am sure we all commend the Senator for her painstaking work in what was a rigorous examination.  Like others, I read the details and reports on it with great interest and real horror in the context of the practices carried out which were so graphically described by Senator David Norris with his customary elegance.  In that context, he has been raising the issue of rendition flights for some time and I support his call for a debate on the matter.  We might, perhaps, debate Senator Feinstein's report in the new year.  I also suggest to the Senator who is a member of the foreign affairs committee that this would be an appropriate topic on which that committee could conduct an investigation.  <\/p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden supported Senator Jillian van Turnhout on the Childline issue and also called for a debate on rent regulation in the light of the PRTB rental index report published toda which notes a 10% increase in rents in the Dublin area.  I will seek a debate on the issue of rent regulation, which would be an important debate to have and which was also sought by Senator Gerard P. Craughwell.  I will seek to have the Minister come to the House as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden also welcomed the announcements made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, on homelessness, in particular the 20 actions on homelessness identified and the sum of &euro;20 million plus which was signed off on this week by the Cabinet.  Other Senators asked about expenditure on homelessness measures.  In this regard, it is important to point out that the Cabinet approved a sum of &euro;20 million plus this week which will be spent on, among other things, the immediate provision of 260 additional emergency beds for persons sleeping rough in Dublin and a night caf&eacute;.  This is welcome.  It is a hugely important innovation designed to provide a contact point for homeless persons who do not want to be placed in emergency accommodation or for whom such accommodation is not suitable.  The night caf&eacute; will provide them with a point of contact and access to meals, showers and so on.<\/p><p>Senator Mary White also supported the call made by Senator Aideen Hayden for a debate on rents and pointed to the connections between the revelations this week about &Aacute;ras Attracta and the abuse of detainees, the link being the abuse of power.  I agree with Senator Mary White in that regard.  I, too, have raised the issue in the context of the detention of persons in prisons.  Thankfully, there have been some improvements in prison conditions in Ireland.  However, as shown in the case of &Aacute;ras Attracta, the appalling treatment of persons in institutions of confinement continues.  <\/p><p>Senator John Kelly spoke about the protests which took place yesterday.  Like him, I, too, compliment and commend all those who came out to engage in peaceful protest.  The atmosphere on Merrion Square appeared to be festival-like and was referred to as uplifting.  As acknowledged by the Right2Water organisers, small breakaway groups did engage in unfortunate and intimidatory tactics.  While I did not witness this, I had visitors who told me they had been intimidated.  Senator John Kelly pointed that anyone who found himself or herself on O'Connell Street yesterday had felt this too, which was unfortunate.  It certainly did no service to the 30,000 who engaged in peaceful protest.   We all wish well the garda who was injured amid the small breakaway protest.<\/p><p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell congratulated Senator Jillian van Turnhout in having the &Aacute;ras Attracta issue debated by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.

All of us in the Seanad are steadfast in our commitment to ensure it will remain in public ownership.  We will have a full debate on the issue next week.<\/p><p>Senator Michael Mullins expressed his good wishes to all those involved in the Belfast talks.  He also spoke about the traffic disruptions during yesterday's protest.  There is no doubt that there were disruptions to traffic, leading to frustration for those who were trying to get home and collect children from cr&egrave;ches.  There is always a balance to be struck in respect of the right to protest.<\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn also spoke about the Childline issue, as well as the issue of prescription drugs.  I was not aware of some of the figures he highlighted.  I was shocked by the statistics for the high levels of prescription drug usage in Britain.  The Senator also spoke about the consequences of the poor handwriting of doctors, of which many of us are aware.  As stated by him, it can have unfortunate consequences.  <\/p><p>The Senator also referred to the motion on Palestine.  Earlier this week I welcomed the decision of the D&aacute;il that the Government would support the motion recognising the state of Palestine, which was really important.

He also raised the issue of direct provision.  I do not think anybody mentioned the fact that the Human Rights and Equality Commission had published a useful set of recommendations for improvements to the system of direct provision and asked that they inform the work of the working group on direct provision established by the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, &Aacute;odhan &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, spoke on this issue in the House.  Some of the recommendations include that direct provision centres would become self-catering.  I think that is of major importance, having visited centres.  I think we are all conscious that one of the key issues is that people are not able to cook for themselves.  One may have a door key to one's accommodation but not being able to cook is really problematic, especially for families with children.  I support Senator Conway's call for the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to come to this House in January to give us an update on the working group's progress.  Our debate would be informed by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's recommendations on direct provision.<\/p><p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen referred to the award given to an organisation called Mary's Meals.  All of us would commend the work of these charities in encouraging education and lifting people out of poverty.  I agree with Senator Mullen on the need for human solidarity across the developing world and that we just do not focus on our own problems at home.  Earlier this week I spoke of Comhl&aacute;mh, having launched one of its funds, and the great work it does in supporting the many volunteers, about 2,000 a year from Ireland, who go to work in developing countries.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen also raised the case of the residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta and pointed out the irony that in the same town, Swinford, there are families pioneering a new approach on autism.  Senator Healy Eames raised questions on &Aacute;ras Attracta and praised Mr. Peter Tyndall, the Ombudsman.  I also heard Mr. Tyndall speak this morning and was very impressed by him.

The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, spoke about the pension review yesterday.  Is there a timeframe in which it is envisaged the Government will address this issue?  Senator Quinn among others raised this issue and effectively showed that it disincentivises further entry into PRSAs which in the main are vehicles for portable pensions.  Many of those in the lower income category and-or those engaged in contract work favour PRSAs.

He must be getting very fond of us.<\/p><p>I thank him for his detailed response on my Committee Stage recommendation on PRSAs, personal retirement savings accounts, and USC, universal social charge.  I have read its great technical detail but it does not detract from the very fundamental principle that, in the eyes of an employee, there is no real difference between a PRSA and a defined contribution occupational pension which is funded by his or her employer.  Why should they be treated differently from a USC perspective?  I do not understand that.<\/p><p>One of the Minister of State&rsquo;s main points is that PRSAs are not benefit-limited but occupational pension schemes are, which is why the USC is applied to an employer.  There is no logic to that decision, for three reasons.  First, the comparison for PRSAs is with defined contribution occupational pension scheme arrangements.  As they are both contribution-based arrangements, they should therefore be subject to the same tax rules.  Second, since 1 January 2014, an overarching limit of &euro;2 million is in place on the total value of retirement benefits that any individual can take from all sources, including PRSAs, before a penal tax charge is applied at retirement.  Accordingly, PRSAs cannot provide unlimited retirement benefits, as they are subject to the same &euro;2 million limit as any other retirement arrangements.  Last, if the USC anomaly - the word also used by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien - were to be remedied, there are existing tax avoidance provisions in tax legislation - section 118B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - which would prevent an employee from foregoing remuneration to allow a large contribution to be made by an employer to a PRSA.<\/p><p>It is incumbent on the Minister of State to reflect on the strength of the case I made on Committee Stage and today on the need to equalise the USC treatment of pension contributions.  I have looked back over the Finance Bills that came before the House in the past five years.  It will come as no surprise to colleagues that not one recommendation has ever been accepted.  I did not go back earlier than 2009, so maybe it goes back much longer.  It is through that lens I view the debate and the Minister of State&rsquo;s position in respect of other worthwhile recommendations discussed in the House yesterday on Committee Stage.  I really believe this recommendation is worthy of attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100010#J00100","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1418298000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I took Senator Zappone&rsquo;s point about the real difficulties for women in the workplace, as well as their entry and exit patterns due to family circumstances.

Leaving that aside, I was more persuaded by the fact the Minister of State had committed to a comprehensive review of the overall pension scenario.  There are other issues attaching to pensions; it is not restricted to the PRSA issue.  I would like this debate to be broadened more to encompass the entire manner in which people provide for themselves into old age.  I have referred before to the Irish people&rsquo;s penchant for acquiring property into old age, the treatment of investment properties and the imposition of USC on gross income even though a loss could have been made on a property.<\/p><p>The Minister of State must bear in mind the wider issues of age and aging, going beyond the simple issue of pension products that need to be taken into account in any tax review as to how people provide for themselves in old age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100010#J00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1418298000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The discussion we had on this on Committee Stage was highly technical, but it was important to put that detail on the record of the House.  Senators&rsquo; concerns about this aspect of private pension provision will be brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention directly.<\/p><p>In yesterday's debate, I explained the background and rationale for the differential treatment of employer contributions to PRSAs and to occupational pension schemes when it comes to USC.  I agree with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that there is not much to be achieved by going back over it today.  However, what I found particularly interesting yesterday was discussions around the lack of private sector pension provision among a large proportion of the workforce, and particularly the difficulties faced by those on low incomes, those who choose to take breaks in their careers to care for children, mainly women, and those who work part-time.<\/p><p>In recognition of these problems, the Government has decided to agree a roadmap and a timeline for the introduction of a new universal supplementary pension savings scheme in 2015.  As I indicated to Senators yesterday, this is a Government priority.  While I cannot be more specific on the timeline, I do expect progress on it over the coming weeks.  The nature of any incentives, including tax incentives, that will encourage and sustain supplementary pension savings among those who do not currently save for their retirement will be a critical aspect of the work that needs to be carried out in designing the new scheme, as will the removal of any perceived impediments to pension saving.<\/p><p>Some Senators made the point that the USC treatment of employer contributions to PRSAs is one such impediment.  That is why the Minister considers that it would be more appropriate to examine all of the issues affecting the take-up of PRSAs together so they can be dealt with in the round as part of the work committed to by the Government next year.<\/p><p>We should of course not forget that provision for private pensions is ultimately dependent on the income of individuals and their capacity to forego an element of that income.  In this regard, the social welfare system provides pensions based on PRSI contributions and based on means tests for those individuals who do not have sufficient contributions.  To purchase an annuity that would provide for a similar level of income to the contributory State pension would require a pension pot of at least &euro;250,000.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance and his Department are cognisant of the issue at play.

The system of individualisation has been in the tax code since 1999 and is obviously an integral part of the overall system.  When first announced, the stated purpose of individualisation was essentially to ease the burden on single persons, who make up 65% of the workforce; to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax; and more generally, to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  Prior to this, a second spouse faced the marginal rate of tax on the first euro, or punt as it was then, earned.<\/p><p>In tandem with individualisation, a home carer allowance was introduced to compensate couples where one spouse stays at home to care for children or other qualifying individuals.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100011#L00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418298600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I cannot hear the Minister of State.

Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but was never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system with the standard rate band being partially transferable between spouses - &euro;9,000 being the gap between single and married one-earner bands.  To complete or reverse individualisation would cost in the region of &euro;800 million.<\/p><p>The Commission on Taxation recommended that no change be made to the current system.  It concluded that the current system represents a balance between acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.  The commission said that the home carer's tax credit was integral to the current hybrid system of individualisation and that &quot;it would not be realistic to contemplate its withdrawal while the current arrangements in relation to the tax bands continue to exist or in circumstances where band individualisation is completed&quot;.  <\/p><p>Senators may be aware that on budget day, the Minister's Department published a number of policy documents, including the report on tax expenditures which included new guidelines for best practice in respect of the evaluation of tax expenditures.  The report describes the purpose and main features of tax expenditure in an Irish context.  In particular, it outlines the limited circumstances where tax expenditures should be used as an alternative to direct Exchequer funding.  The report also discussed recent tax expenditure evaluations carried out in Ireland in the past few years.  The guidelines are informed by international best practice in this area and work carried out in other countries.  It is available on the budget website and the guidelines have been circulated to all Secretaries General in all relevant Departments.  <\/p><p>Given the recent reviews carried out by the Commission on Taxation, the Minister does not believe that a full cost-benefit analysis on the home carer's tax credit is warranted at this time.

The Minister spoke very eloquently, as I hope the rest of us did yesterday, about the burden of tax on people.  I am fairly stunned by some of the figures I worked up to see how we compare.  I will repeat some of the figures I mentioned yesterday.  At the moment, we compare very poorly with other countries such as our nearest neighbour, the UK.  In the UK, one would need to earn over &pound;150,000 to go on to the top rate of tax.  This is five times the figure in Ireland.

The House knows what I mean - giving people their say.  In Germany, which is the country we seem encouraged to look up to so much and which riles people in this country due to the fact that we bailed out its banking system, the top tax rate only kicks in at &euro;225,000.  That is seven times the figure here.  I asked myself what would be fair here so I looked at the average industrial wage.  Correct me if I am wrong but according to the CSO, the average industrial wage in February was &euro;43,101.  Our high rate of tax kicks in at &euro;10,000 less than the average industrial wage in this country.  All I am asking the Minister of State to do is, and I am asking both sides of the House to join with me on this, ask the Minister to carry out a calculation for us.  I am asking the Minister to figure out and come back to us within three months with a report laying out the cost to the State of significantly increasing the income threshold at which the top rate of tax would kick in.<\/p> <p>The Minister can work out the meaning of \"significant\" from his point of view but I am asking him to determine what the cost to the State would be if the top tax rate kicked in at the average industrial wage.  What would happen if we could increase the income thresholds significantly?  It would first reduce the tax burden by taking more people out of the top rate and putting them on the standard rate.  The Minister spoke about that also.  For the people on over the average industrial wage it would reduce the amount of income that would be charged at the 40% rate.  Given that they pay the universal social charge, USC, PRSI, etc., on top of that, never mind all the stealth taxes such as property tax, the septic tank charge and, soon, water charges, they are paying a good deal in taxes.<\/p><p>Does the Minister know that in terms of our incentive as a nation for labour force participation, Ireland is 132nd out of 144 countries.  Why work?  Nobody is incentivised to work when the top rate of tax kicks in at &euro;32,000.  One could not rear a family on that.  One certainly could not buy a house on it.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister will say he thought it was a sensible idea when he spoke with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to accept this and prepare that report.  He might not say that but even if Senator Paul Bradford or myself had never proposed it, he should implement it because he needs to figure out how to take the people of the nation out of the quagmire in which they are burdened.  I accept fully that we must have a tax debate in which we would examine how we fund our nation, including the provision of services, put money back into people's pockets and grow the economy.<\/p><p>In the report I am asking the Minister to include I want to know the definition of a significant increase, the cost of that and whether there would be a knock-on effect on services.  What would be the cost if we increased that threshold to the average industrial wage?  I also want the Minister to do a cost benefit analysis on how it could kick start the economy.  That is the area the Government is not good at assessing.  If we put more money back into people's pockets, what impact might that have on the entire economy, not just on Galway city or the capital but on rural economies up and down the country where, thankfully, a good few people are working.  What impact might that have on attracting our talent back to this country?  There is a difference between talent and skills.  We all know skills are needed but talent is creativity and once talented young people are mobile, and one is largely mobile when one is single, does not have children or when one has a partner who is prepared to go with one, one will source out the economies that can offer good tax rates and good opportunities.<\/p><p>The eldest daughter of a neighbour of mine is 26.  She is a primary teacher and she has a boyfriend who is 26 or 27.  One of them had got a post in the United Kingdom.  The other was interviewing - one is a primary teacher and the other a secondary teacher - but they said that they were a couple and unless they got the deal they wanted they would not stay in the country.  They got the deal they wanted and will work within 15 minutes of each other's location.  The point I am making is that they are mobile.  We need that talent here.  Why do we not have those fine young people educating our children?<\/p><p>One of my children is losing an after-school teacher because she is emigrating.

The focus is on reducing the marginal rate of tax from 52% to 51% for everyone earning between &euro;32,800 and &euro;70,000, while maintaining the highly progressive nature of the Irish income tax system.  The extension of the standard rate band by &euro;1,000 provided for in the Bill is an integral part of this tax reduction package.  It is the Government's stated position that this is the first stage in a three-year plan to reduce the tax burden on the Irish people that will be implemented across subsequent budgets if there is the fiscal space, which we believe there will be, to allow us to do so.<\/p><p>I would draw Senator Healy Eames's attention to the Tax Ready Reckoner as published by the Revenue Commissioners on their website.  This contains estimates of the likely cost of changes to income tax and USC rates, credits and bands.  For example, an increase in the standard rate band of &euro;2,000 would cost in the region of &euro;421 million in a full year.  I assure the Senator that this is something Government has to do in advance of every budget in terms of deciding what we can afford to do and what would benefit the economy and our people in doing it.  That is happening but in terms of citizens, Members of the Oireachtas and all of us modelling the cost of a change, the ready reckoner on the Revenue's website provides us with the information on the cost of changing a band, a rate or a credit.<\/p><p>Using the ready reckoner it is possible to model numerous changes to the tax system and calculate the resulting costs and yields.  However, in considering options for a budgetary tax package it is necessary to take account of all parts of the package, along with expenditure proposals.  That was part of the discussion we had yesterday, and Senator Hayden intervened on this point as well.  Obviously, when we are considering the cost of giving back on tax and the benefit to the economy we must weight that with the cost of providing public service.  That is the balancing act for every government the world over because there will always be limited resources.<\/p><p>There is limited value in further analysing individual measures in isolation so for the reasons I have given, the Minister does not see the need to produce a report.  He certainly does not see the need to legislate to produce the report in the Finance Bill, and he cannot accept the recommendation.  However, I would reiterate, as would the Minister for Finance if he were here because he has already publicly done so on many occasions, that it is the outlined position of both parties in the Government to look at that real tax wedge, which I agree with Senator Healy Eames is currently a disincentive to work.  It is certainly a disincentive to work harder, to being promoted and to moving from part-time to full-time work.  I outlined some scenarios yesterday where I had come across that as being a real disincentive.  I hope the measures in this Finance Bill will act as an incentive in the sense of sending a message to the young people the Senator spoke of, my own generation, that we are moving onto a trajectory where we are trying to reduce labour taxes.  That is something I want to see through, and I hope it is something the Senator can support.<\/p> <p>I am sorry, but I cannot accept the recommendation.  I accept the spirit of what the Senator said, the concept behind reducing taxes on work and the acknowledgement that the high tax burden is costing us talent in the country.  It is something we have to recognise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100012#M00700","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418299800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I accept what the Minister of State is saying about the spirit of the proposal, which is good.  It is, however, something of an excuse to say we do not use the Finance Bill as a reason to prepare reports.  I published the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2014.  It is on the Order Paper, but it has not been accepted for discussion because I am not part of a group.  Senator Paul Bradford and I are at a disadvantage in the House for that reason.  We cannot secure time to have the Bill debated.  I spoke to many people during the construction of the Bill, including a senior counsel who had a lot of experience in drafting financial Bills.  One of the requirements under the Bill would be that two reports be laid before the Houses.  One would lay out, mid-year, the financial balance sheet.  It is great, yet unbelievable, that the Minister of State can say all of the information is on the Revenue Commissioners' website and that there is a ready reckoner, but I would like the information to be provided here.  He knows what my recommendation is and that it refers to the top rate of tax.  It would have been nice if he had been able to me what the cost would be in the case of a figure &euro;1,000 at the top rate.  He referred to the standard tax rate, but my recommendation refers to the top rate.  Such taxpayers are in the squeezed middle and they are being choked.  They should definitely be taxed at the standard rate which kicks in at a figure of &euro;32,000 a year.  This is ridiculous.  I wish I could outline the mortgage one could afford to repay or that one could not afford to spend more than &euro;100 a week on food.  <\/p><p>The recommendation is minor.  I appreciate that the information is available, but it should be shared in the House and included in the Official Report.  I was a member of one of the Government parties when it was elected.  We had stood for reform and said we would do things differently and have an open mind.  When I was on the other side of the House, we did not have this.  I am now in opposition because we did not keep our promises.  Let us have an open mind about doing things better.  To be fair to the Minister of State, he is probably knocking his head against a block wall with regard to suggestions he may wish to take on board.  Just because something was not done in a certain way does not mean things should not change and be done better.  Therefore, I am disappointed.  Would it not be great if, before St. Patrick's Day, we could say a new report had been laid before the Houses and that a debate would be held on it?  We will not hear about the budget again until next September, even though we should have a debate in March and another in June.

It is an issue that was discussed extensively in the D&aacute;il where the Senators' colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, raised it.  We had a lengthy debate on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il also.  The bottom line is that this is an issue which the Minister for Finance has asked the Office of the Attorney General to consider.  I will outline why we have arrived at that point.<\/p><p>Deputy Michael McGrath clarified in the D&aacute;il that his amendment in that House was based on the consent of the primary carer to the transfer of the unused amount of the credit.  I am assuming that is the basis for the Senators' recommendation also.  The recommendation appears to envisage a number of changes to the current system, the first of which is that the entitlement of the secondary claimant would be linked to compliance with a court's maintenance order.  The second is that a parent will have some preference over other possible secondary claimants such as grandparents.  The third is that part of the credit rather than the whole credit could be transferred.  It is not clear whether the Senators envisage that the current requirement that a child reside with the secondary claimant for at least 100 days in the year would continue.<\/p><p>Linking the transfer of the credit or part thereof to parentage or court ordered maintenance payments could raise constitutional concerns.  From a practical point of view, it is difficult to see how it would be administered.  Disputes about whether maintenance was paid or not would then give rise to disputes about whether the tax credit was due or not.  It is not clear whether the recommendation of the Senators would give a parent with whom a child resides for only a minimal period of the year preference over, for example, a grandparent with whom the child might reside for more than 100 days of the year.  While the Minister does not propose to accept the recommendation at this time, he has asked his officials to seek the advice of the Office of the Attorney General in this matter.<\/p><p>As regards relinquishing a portion of the credit, the Minister has instructed his officials to work with the Revenue Commissioners to investigate the administrative, operational and data protection issues involved.  It is worth noting that relinquishment of a portion of the credit is likely to give rise to significant difficulties in some situations, for example, where a primary claimant has children with more than one partner.  There are also likely budgetary implications to be considered.  Once the relevant information from the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Attorney General has been gathered and assessed, the Minister undertakes to consider the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100015#P00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418300700,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.

The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated into the Bill, including provision for minimum unit pricing, which I believe is the most appropriate measure to tackle the problem of the availability of low-priced alcohol.<\/p><p>Although I welcome the Senator's recommendation, as does the Minister for Finance, we believe it is unduly restrictive in terms of the remit of the report it proposes.  It would confine the scope of the proposed report to examining the possibility of retailers' off-licence duty being graduated on the basis of retail space only.  However, the Minister for Finance does believe there is merit in conducting a broader examination of the alcohol licensing regime, taking account of both the off-trade and the on-trade.  To that end, he has asked his officials to bring forward options for his consideration in the context of next year's budget and finance Bill.  <\/p><p>I will incorporate the spirit of what Senator O'Brien wishes to achieve in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100017#R00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1418301900,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

This is trickier than it seems at first because of the factors the Senator has outlined with respect to EU law.  Nicotine replacement patches are subject to the 23% standard rate of VAT, while other nicotine products such as nicotine inhalers, tablets and chewing gum are categorised as oral medicines and thereby qualify for the zero rate of VAT.  Nicotine replacement patches cannot be considered an oral medicine and as such do not qualify for the zero rate of VAT.<\/p><p>When considering the VAT system and the VAT treatment of any product or service, the VAT rating of goods and services is governed by the requirements of the EU VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The application of the zero rate of VAT to medicines is a historical derogation from the normal VAT system, and the zero rate can apply only in restrictive circumstances.  Under EU rules, Ireland can continue to apply the zero rate of VAT to certain items to which it was applied on 1 January 1991 for clearly defined social reasons and for the benefit of the final consumer.  Oral medicines, including nicotine tablets and chewing gum, meet these criteria and continue to be liable at the zero rate.  Nicotine replacement patches have not been liable at the zero rate from 1991, and so cannot now be made liable at the zero rate.

This has been debated in the D&aacute;il, here and in the media.  If one takes Dublin, for instance, there has been a 40%-plus increase in property prices in the last year.  Nationwide, it has been about 25%.  We are looking at substantial increases in the local property tax.  We are trying to give certainty with this recommendation by giving the Minister the right and the ability to set that revaluation date aside.  The valuation is fixed through to 2019 or whatever date the Minister provides for at the time.  It is something that Government has to examine.  There have been substantial increases in property prices.  People will be paying much more under the property tax if Government does not step in.  It is better to give a bit of certainty on this and not to wait to review it.  I have heard the Minister, Deputy Noonan, speaking on this issue, and the Minister of State and I have also discussed it.  <br\/>Recommendation No. 16 is that the local property tax paid in respect of a rented property shall be deductible by a liable person in accordance with section 11 for income tax and corporation tax purposes.  That makes absolute sense.  Very little is deductible on rental income.  The local property tax should be deductible.  The recommendation says what we want.  I will not labour this point further.  <br\/>The main recommendation, recommendation No. 18, which I really want Government to consider very strongly, provides that liable persons who are obliged to pay an annual fee to a management company in respect of private housing or apartment complexes shall be eligible to deduct from their annual local property tax one third of the amount of such management fee paid, or &euro;350, whichever is greater.  All of us are aware that there are thousands of people in this country paying property tax.  There are also thousands of people paying management fees.  They are people living in apartments and privately managed estates who pay management fees of varying amounts.  Many local authorities insisted, by way of conditions in planning permission, that these estates be private estates.  Therefore, they were never taken in charge by the local authority.  People pay for insurance, lighting and a sinking fund, and they pay separately for their waste disposal.  They derive basically no services from the local authority.  Yet someone living in an apartment who could be paying &euro;1,600 or &euro;1,700 a year in management fees is also paying a property tax.  When the property tax legislation was going through the House, we tabled an amendment looking for certain exemptions.  This was defeated at the time.  We are not looking for these people not to pay property tax at all.  It would be much better to give some type of relief, as outlined here.  The relief would be on one third of the management fee, if certified as being paid, or &euro;350, whichever is greater.  There is a reason for the &euro;350 limit.  Some prestigious properties might have management fees of &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000.  I am not looking to exempt them either.  I am seeking to provide this relief in particular to those who bought at the height of the market, a time when apartments and managed estates were coming through.  This is a sensible suggestion.  It is something we can and should do.  It would give some type of relief to people who are effectively paying on the double.  They are paying a local property tax and getting nothing for it, in the sense that they are getting nothing for it in their own immediate area.  I understand the LPT is supposed to go into more than that when it is eventually disbursed to the local authorities, unlike this year or last year.  However, this is an area that does need to be examined.  It is unfair on people.  Many people bought properties in estates such as these.  They had no choice.  I am not talking purely about gated communities.  There are thousands of dwellings within a stone's throw from here on which people will be paying management fees.  These are normal houses and apartments.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's views on this and whether we can do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100017#R01800","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1418301900,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I second the recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100017#R01900","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1418301900,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I have a fair degree of sympathy for a number of the issues raised by Senator O'Brien.<\/p> <p>I would like to highlight a couple of issues relating to the tax treatment of rented properties, which issues I also highlighted earlier in the context of the debate about the universal social charge.  Many Members will be aware that I am very much in favour of rent regulation to protect tenants from unfair rent increases.  I am also against unfair tax treatment of landlords because this destabilises the entire rental sector.  An issue arises in the owners of rented properties not being treated like any other business in that they are not allowed to write-off costs which, if they were involved in a different business, they would be.<\/p><p>I would like to make two particular points.  First, on the local property tax, ultimately it is neither fish nor fowl in that it is not in reality a local tax or a property tax.  There is a need for clarification on this issue.  Amounts paid for local services should be, if paid for by a landlord, tax deductible.  There should also be clarity on who exactly, in the landlord-tenant relationship, is liable for the provision of services.  <\/p><p>Another issue is that of management fees in the case of apartments.  If we accept that the local property tax is for the provision of services, there needs to be recognition of the fact that people living in apartment blocks already pay for many of the services to be provided for others living close to them in other forms of housing such as a three bedroom semi-detached house.  There is an element of unfairness in the way this is structured in that it does not take into account the fact that 78% of the properties built in Dublin between 2002 and 2007 were apartment developments.  We have never really come to terms with how we treat apartment living.  It is something of which we will have to be cognisant.<\/p><p>I am asking two things of the Minister of State.  First, the recent DKM-ESRI report on the rented sector recommended a number of changes to the tax treatment of landlords and the rented property sector.  This recommendation needs to be acted on and the whole issue of the tax treatment of the rented sector needs to be addressed in the context of an overall review of the sector generally.  Second, we need to revisit the legislation on apartment developments and management costs in the context of their tax treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100017#R02000","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418302500,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien for this series of recommendations.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 15 seeks to give broad discretion to the Minister on when properties should be revalued for LPT purposes.  As the local property tax is a new tax, the Government wishes to provide certainty for homeowners.  For this reason, valuation periods of three years were introduced, with the exception of the first valuation period which covers three and a half years.  In addition to providing certainty, this also eases the administrative burden on the homeowner in that it is not necessary to have a house revalued each year.  <\/p><p>Senators may be aware that with certain exceptions under the LPT legislation where a property is not a relevant residential property on a valuation date, in other words, not liable for LPT, it will not be a relevant resident property until the next valuation date.  In the interests of equity for compliant LPT payers, it is important to have regular valuation dates in order that newly built properties are brought into the LPT net.  It also provides certainty for those homeowners on when they will become liable for LPT.<\/p><p>In the absence of further valuation dates, new properties built after 1 May 2013 would not be liable for LPT and would not have a valuation for LPT purposes.  Should these properties be brought into the scope of LPT using a different valuation date, it would be inequitable to those homeowners that their LPT liabilities would be assessed using a later valuation date when compared to those on the property register.<\/p><p>While the Minister is conscious of the concerns of homeowners in relation to increasing property prices and the affect this will have on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, the recommendation, in his view, would not be the most appropriate way to address these concerns.  The next valuation date is 1 November 2016.  In advance of this date, the Minister and his officials will be examining LPT and any impact on LPT liabilities owing to increasing property prices.  However, any such consideration at this stage would be premature.  For the reasons outlined, the Minister does not propose to accept recommendation No. 15.<\/p><p>Recommendations Nos. 16 and 17 deal with LPT deductions for landlords.  Chapter 4 of Part 8 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the charging to tax under Case V of Schedule D of income arising on rent from property in the State.  The income chargeable under Case V in respect of such a property is computed by making the deductions for expenditure authorised by section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act from the gross rent.  These deductions include, for example, expenditure on rates, maintenance, repairs and interest on a loan used to purchase, improve or repair the rental property.  Recommendation No. 16 seeks to add to these allowable deductions by proposing a new deduction for local property tax paid on rental property.  Senators are probably aware that the Thornhill group have suggested there seems to be an argument for allowing at least a portion of LPT paid on a rental property to be deductible for tax purposes, in the same way as commercial rates are so deductible.  However, having regard to the pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, the report also suggested consideration be given to the phasing in of deductibility over a period of years.  This approach was accepted in principle by the Government. <\/p><p>As stated by the Minister in his 2015 Budget Statement 2015, both the taxation and expenditure sides of the budget are designed to support and broaden the economic recovery that the country is experiencing.  As such, available resources have been carefully targeted at initiatives that will build consumer confidence, support jobs and strengthen demand in the domestic economy.  In this context, the Minister considers that this is not an opportune time for him to introduce a deduction for local property tax paid on rental property.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 17 would require the Minister to issue report within six months of the enactment of this legislation detailing how and when he would introduce a deduction for local property tax paid for the purpose of computing taxable rental income.  The question of when such a deduction should to be introduced and the extent of any such deduction would be best considered as part of the budgetary and Finance Bill process rather than through the issuance of a report on the matter in the manner suggested in the recommendation.  On this basis, the Minister cannot accept the recommendations.  However, the principle of deductibility based on the Thornhill group report is accepted by the Government.<\/p><p>Recommendations Nos. 18 and 19 deal with LPT relief in respect of management fees.  The introduction of a local property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property.  The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes which have proved to be an unstable source of Government revenue with an annual recurring property tax which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  The Government decided that LPT should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity and that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property, with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept at a minimum for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  Properties in managed estates to which such fees apply would have been purchased by the owners in the knowledge that they would be taking on the commitment to partake in and fund the management of the estate and that it was the intention that many such estates would not be taken in charge by local authorities, nor, in many cases, would it be appropriate for the local authorities to do so.  Management fees in these estates provide for refuse collection, the maintenance of common areas and a sinking fund for certain repairs to buildings, depending on circumstances.  It is fair to say many of these costs are borne by homeowners and other households.  It is important to make the distinction that many of the services covered by management fees are ones for which people not paying management fees also have to pay.  I accept that is not the case in respect of all services, but it is in some of them.<\/p><p>Revenue from the local property tax accrues to local authorities and supports the provision of local services.  Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm which benefit the wider community.  The proper functioning of these services is important for the well-being of every community and household.  I accept that the Senator has acknowledged that local property taxes stretch further than estates and cover fire and emergency services, road maintenance, cleaning, street lighting, spatial and development planning and other similar services, regulatory and inspection functions, business support services, libraries, parks, recreational and cultural and public amenities.  The benefits of these services obviously accrue to all members of society.<\/p><p>Recommendation No. 19 would require the Minister to issue a report within six months of the enactment of this legislation detailing how and when he would introduce a provision whereby liable persons who are obliged to pay an annual management fee to a management company in respect of private housing or apartment complexes would be eligible to deduct part of the cost of such management fees from their local annual property tax.  For the reasons outlined, I cannot accept the recommendation.<\/p><p>Senator Aideen Hayden referred to the DKM study.

There are various things outside our control but the Minister should be given the leeway to be able to vary that, and the purpose of recommendation No. 15 is to permit it.<\/p><p>That is all I wish to say on those points, but I will press some of the recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100018#S00300","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1418303100,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Recommendation put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 8; N\u00edl, 25.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Thomas Byrne and Darragh O'Brien; N\u00edl, Senators Aideen Hayden and Pat O'Neill.<\/p><p>Recommendation declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100019#T00200","aye":["1116","1159","1128","1139","1154","1145","1155","1156"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1165","1124","1158","1130","1166","1117","1172","1152","1135","1161","1167","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1169","1170","1125","1171","1176"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418303400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Recommendations Nos. 16 and 17 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418303400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I move Recommendation No. 18:<blockquote><br \/>In page134, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:<br \/><b>&ldquo;Amendment of Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012<\/b><b>100. <\/b>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 is amended by inserting the following after section 17&mdash;<blockquote><b>&ldquo;17A.<\/b>Liable persons who are obliged to pay an annual management fee to a management company in respect of private housing or apartment complexes shall be eligible to deduct from his or her annual local property tax liability&mdash;<blockquote>(a) one third of the amount of such management fee paid, or<br \/>(b) &euro;350, <br \/>whichever is greater&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100020#U00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1418303400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I second the recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100020#U00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"vote","time":1418303400,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Recommendation put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 8; N\u00edl, 27.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Thomas Byrne and Darragh O'Brien; N\u00edl, Senators Aideen Hayden and Pat O'Neill..<\/p><p>Recommendation declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100020#U00400","aye":["1116","1196","1159","1128","1139","1154","1145","1156"],"nay":["1148","1138","1150","1165","1124","1158","1130","1166","1117","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1167","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1169","1170","1125","1155","1171","1176"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418303700,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Recommendation No. 19 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418303700,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Bill received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1418303700,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the Bill be returned to the D\u00e1il.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 26; N\u00edl, 12.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Aideen Hayden and Pat O'Neill; N\u00edl, Senators Thomas Byrne and Darragh O'Brien.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100021#V00300","aye":["1148","1138","1150","1165","1124","1158","1130","1166","1117","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1167","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1169","1170","1125","1171","1176"],"nay":["1116","1196","1133","1159","1128","1122","1123","1139","1154","1145","1155","1156"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1418304000,"counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100022#W00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418304000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418304000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418304000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote><br \/><b>1. <\/b>In page 4, after line 38, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Amendment of Act of 1992<\/b><br \/><b>3. <\/b>The Act of 1992 is amended by the insertion of the following new section after section 61:<blockquote><b>&ldquo;Common good<\/b><br \/><b>61A<\/b>.

However, the Constitution also recognises the principles of social justice and provides that the State may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of such rights in the exercise of the common good.<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>Therefore, the various laws that govern intellectual property rights provide saving provisions of the type with which the Senators are concerned.  These provisions allow Government, if necessary, to legislate where there are public interest issues at stake.<br\/>At national, European and international level, intellectual property rights enjoy protection that is set down under well established and respected principles.  At international level, the State is party to a number of international treaties and conventions that provide for the type of common good provision that the Senators are proposing.  These include the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, dating from 1883, and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement of 1994, known as the TRIPS agreement.  The TRIPS agreement, which introduced intellectual property into the international trading system for the first time, remains the most comprehensive international agreement on intellectual property to date.<br\/>In summary, whether at national, European or international level, IP protections are not of themselves absolute rights, and there exist provisions to allow states to apply derogations that allow for the suspension of part of the legal obligation which can operate to restrict some rights under certain circumstances, such as in the pursuit of broader compelling public policy reasons or for greater public interest considerations.<br\/>While fully appreciating the intent behind the Senator's amendment, I am not in a position to accept the amendment, as it would be wholly inappropriate to provide for the limitation of intellectual property on a blanket basis in a provision of the Patents Act.  It is more appropriate that the <i>status quo<\/i>prevail, allowing for the delimitation of rights in certain expressed circumstances under the various IP legislative Acts, EU instruments and international treaties or agreements to which the State is party.  <br\/>I hope that clarifies the position.  We believe there is sufficient cover to do what the Senator wants to do in certain circumstances, but it is unnecessary to bring it in across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100022#W00500","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418304300,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418304300,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Sections 3 to 5, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418304300,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418304300,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418304300,"counter":204,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Fifth Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100023#X00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418304300,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100023#X00800","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418304300,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418304300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I want to address a number of issues that were raised on Tuesday.  We are all a little rushed here and I did not have time to go through them all.  First, I want to thank everyone for their co-operation on this Bill.  The changes are modest but it is an important Bill.  It is important that our IP regime is correct because it is of major benefit to us in terms of job creation and winning new products and services.  I thank everyone for their work on that. They form part of the incremental improvements required to ensure our legislation remains supportive of the type of high-value and high-tech investment that the economy needs.  We all recognise that, and it was recognised in the debate on Tuesday also.  I thank everyone for their help on that.<\/p><p>A number of issues were raised.  While noting that the Bill deals specifically with veterinary and human medicinal products, Senator Quinn raised the issue of products in the agriculture, agrifood and biotech sectors as well as the GM sector.  The original research exemption provided for by section 42(g) and the new broader exemption provided for in this Bill are confined to acts done to obtain a marketing authorisation for human and veterinary medicinal products only.  The exemption would not apply to the sectors mentioned by the Senator.  The specific sectors identified by Senator Quinn come within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and would be subject to regulation by that Department.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn also mentioned counterfeit medicines, which I addressed the other day.  The licensing and control of medicines are a matter for the Department of Health and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which regulates the manufacture, distribution, sale and supply, marketing, advertising, etc., of medicinal products for human use.<\/p><p>Counterfeiting of pharmaceutical products is criminalised under various legislative regimes, including the medicinal products regulatory regime that implements EU directives and the Irish trademark and Customs legislative regimes.  The Garda and the Customs Service are the enforcement authorities in Ireland.  The EU is currently putting in place better action plans to fight against counterfeiting.  One proposal is in the nature of a &quot;follow the money&quot; initiative that will cover all forms of IP infringement over the Internet, which aims to include the various stakeholders in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, the goal being to deprive infringers of IP of their revenue streams.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn also raised the issue of Government services being opened up to private suppliers that can provide a service by a cheaper method.  If I understand the Senator correctly, this falls within the remit of the Department of Health and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  HIQA is responsible for carrying out health technology assessments that generate information about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of health technologies, drugs, medical devices, diagnostic techniques, surgical procedures and public health programmes such as cancer screening programmes.  We will write directly to the Minister for Health about the issues the Senator raised, but I also referred the previous day to products and services.  The health innovation hub is a place where we can bring the various enterprise and health stakeholders together to tease out new products, ideas and services.  The trial, which was based in Cork, has worked quite well.  A decision was taken to have a permanent health innovation hub.  Where that will be located, who will be based in it and so on will be decided before June or July next year.  There is a public consultation on that, but a firm decision has been taken to have it as a permanent feature.  That will be a great place for Irish business people who have ideas about a health product or a new initiative or device to come together and involve the consultants, doctors and various players in health to develop something that will be used.<\/p><p>Senator Burke, who is not present, raised the issue of the Unified Patent Court, and I would like to clarify the position on this court.  The international agreement setting up the UPC, which Ireland signed in 2013, provides for a central division which will have its seat in Paris but with sections in London and Munich.  Signatory states can choose to confer jurisdiction on this central division, join with one or more member states to host a regional division or host a local division.  Subject to the passing of a constitutional referendum, the Government has decided that Ireland will host a local division.  In addition to hosting the section of the central court that will deal with life sciences, London will also host a local division.  All divisions will hear cases on the basis of international rather than national law.  That will be a major asset to many of our smaller companies that are developing new products and patents, because currently one would have to go to 28 countries in 28 jurisdictions either to have a case heard or to make a complaint against another company.  The new patent court will be a one-stop shop for 25 countries; three decided not to join in.  That will narrow down the work an Irish company would have to do, because there is a high cost in protecting a patent or if one is accused of copying somebody else's patent.  This will make the process more straightforward and much easier.  <\/p><p>It is important that we have a local division.  Presentations were made at committee some years ago to the effect that Ireland would have a local division.  Thankfully, that advice was listened to and a decision was made in September to make sure we have a local division.  <\/p><p>The next issue will be the referendum.  It will not be the most exciting referendum but it is important for Ireland that it be passed, because it will have a major beneficial impact on small and medium-sized businesses in Ireland.  Some of the larger ones might not like the changes, but I believe the majority of businesses would welcome the changes proposed.  I will engage with everybody to see if we can get cross-party support on the referendum, because it is important that we get people to vote for this important issue.  European referendums are not the most exciting and it can be difficult to get people behind them, but this one is essential, and I will engage with the Members at some stage in the new year on how we can plan that.<\/p><p>Senator Burke also raised an issue concerning cost-effectiveness in the health service, and he referenced a particular project.  I gave the Senator a commitment that I would raise that with the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  It sounds like an important one, and if we can make connections in that regard we will try to do so.<\/p><p>I hope those clarifications have been useful to the Senators.  I will send them written correspondence also referring to the various principles to which I spoke.  I thank them for their efforts in passing the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100023#X01000","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1418304300,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

She had hoped to be here today herself to take Second Stage but, fortunately for me, she had to travel to Stormont, and I got the opportunity to come in to the Seanad.<\/p><p>This is a short social welfare Bill by normal standards but nonetheless it marks a positive shift in our economic and social recovery.  This recovery can now clearly be seen.  According to the European Commission, Ireland will be the fastest-growing economy in the EU this year, with our growth rate expected to be 4.6% compared to an EU average of just 1.3%.  The latest CSO quarterly national household data shows that there was an annual increase in employment of 1.4% or 26,800 in the year to the third quarter of 2014, bringing total employment on a seasonally-adjusted basis to nearly 2 million people.  Overall, almost 125,000 people have left the live register so far this year to take up employment.  Importantly, the vast majority of people returning to work are returning to full-time employment.  In budget 2015, the Government delivered a package that will reduce taxes for middle and low-income workers and provide welfare increases in a number of key areas, such as child benefit and the living alone allowance.  By any standards, that is a remarkable turnaround given the economic crisis this Government inherited upon taking office.<\/p><p>The main social protection measures contained in this Bill and in budget 2015 are an increase of &euro;5 a month per child in child benefit from January 2015; the introduction of a new back to work family dividend scheme to help people back to work; an increase in the living alone allowance to &euro;9 a week from January 2015; the payment of a Christmas bonus of 25% to all long-term welfare recipients in early December; the retention of the weekly earnings disregard for recipients of one-parent family payment at its current level of &euro;90; and a doubling of JobsPlus places from 3,000 to 6,000 and increased funding for JobPath.<\/p><p>I am conscious that, in the six years since the banking collapse, some very difficult social welfare changes have had to be made.  The Government has been able to prioritise the protection of basic social welfare rates and maintain a social welfare safety net that is among the most effective in the EU at reducing poverty.  We are now realising the benefits of the sacrifices that have been made by the Irish people, as we emerge from the unprecedented economic crisis that has impacted so significantly on our country.  Budget 2015 now reinforces the improvements in the economy by sharing the gains of our recovery in an equitable and sustainable manner.  Together with more measured announcements in the budget, the measures being provided in this Bill will begin the process of restoring living standards for families, for older people and for low and middle-income workers.  I am very pleased that it has been possible, for the first time since forming this Government, to have been able to provide for modest increases in social welfare payments, and they are modest increases.<\/p><p>The Government's statement of priorities published earlier in the year promised a new deal on living standards for low and middle-income families.  In line with this commitment and in recognition of the sacrifices that have been made and the difficulties still facing many families, the Bill provides for a &euro;5 increase in the rate of child benefit as announced in budget 2015.  This will bring the monthly rate of child benefit from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per child, with effect from 1 January 2015.  This increase represents an annual increase of &euro;60 for each child, bringing the overall annual investment through the child benefit system to &euro;1,620 for each child.  This measure will benefit more than 1.1 million children in 612,800 families.  The Government has also committed to increase the monthly rate of child benefit by a further &euro;5 in 2016, provided that the circumstances allow and the economy continues to perform.  Child benefit has been critical in supporting families through difficult times and this increase will help families to build a better financial future and boost the recovery.  Child benefit helps to prevent poverty, along with other child income supports paid to welfare recipients and low-paid working families.  Altogether, the Government will provide a combined weekly payment of &euro;63 for vulnerable children.  These and other social transfers greatly reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 45% to 19%.  Child benefit is one of the few universal payments in the welfare system in that regard and its universality has an important role to play in maintaining the welfare system.  That every child receives child benefit, regardless of their employment status, also ensures that this payment does not act as a disincentive to work.<\/p><p>Last week the live register figures, which show a year-on-year reduction of 10%, are a clear demonstration of the jobs-led recovery overseen by the Government.  There were 10% fewer people on the live register last month as compared with November 2013, and that 10% reduction over a year is a substantial improvement.  Unemployment now stands at 10.7%, down from a crisis figure of 15%.  The number of long-term unemployed has also seen a fall of 7.4% in the last year.  This is still far too high.  However, the pace of the reduction in unemployment is now accelerating and I am confident that we will get unemployment below 10% within the next year.  Employment creation remains a central focus of Government policy.  In particular, we want to ensure that people who lost their jobs during the crisis can now benefit from the strong economic recovery under way.<\/p><p>A vital part of Government's strategy is the need for additional activation measures in the interim while the economy recovers.  This is the rationale behind the Government's activation strategy, Pathways to Work.  In order to support the implementation of Pathways to Work, &euro;1.6 billion is being made available in 2015 to provide approximately 300,000 work and training places.  An additional &euro;12 million has been allocated for the JobPath initiative which will match the long-term unemployed with appropriate training and employment opportunities.  That is one of the most significant aspects, because the people who became unemployed at the very start of this recession are the ones who now need to be trained so they can access employment.  In other recessions, we have seen people being left behind because they were unfortunate enough to get detached from the workforce and were not close to the market.  The training positions that are being made available and the extra resources that are being put in are quite significant.<\/p> <p>We are also doubling the number of positions on JobsPlus to 6,000, with a focus on young unemployed people, at a cost of &euro;13.5 million in a full year.  Under the JobsPlus scheme, monthly cash grants are paid to employers to help with wage costs when recruiting long-term unemployed jobseekers.  One of the interesting statistic relating to JobsPlus is that over 60% of those recruited last year had been unemployed for longer than two years.  The initiative is focused and is clearly getting people who had been quite removed from the workforce back into employment.  This is why I am so pleased to see the doubling of the number of positions to 6,000.  Hopefully, demand will grow and we will see many of our long-term unemployed back in the workforce.  This must be one of our main priorities.<br\/>In addition, a new incentive, the back to work family dividend, is being introduced, which will help jobseekers with families return to work.  This dividend will provide an incentive of up to &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount in the second year.  The scheme will apply to families returning to work from the beginning of 2015 and will cost &euro;22 million in 2015 and &euro;46 million in a full year.  It also offers people a great opportunity to start their own business.  I believe many of those who have been long-term unemployed will avail of this incentive dividend to get back into employment.  The necessary administrative and technical details of the dividend are currently being developed, but will not be finalised in time for inclusion in this Bill.  Instead, the required legislative amendments will be provided for in a further Social Welfare Bill which will be introduced early in the new year, with a view to enactment by the end of March 2015.  While the dividend will come into operation in early April 2015, payment of the dividend will be backdated to the beginning of January in the case of families taking up employment from that date.  There is no bar, therefore, to returning to work in the new year.  People should realise the dividend will be backdated to January and paid in a lump sum.<br\/>The 2015 Social Welfare Bill will also provide for a number of other changes to the social welfare code arising from policy, administrative, operational and control matters.  The back to work family dividend, when taken together with the employer incentives under JobsPlus and the activation measures under the JobPath scheme, will ensure that people who have remained on the live register for a prolonged period can also benefit from the recovery in the labour market.  Senators are aware of people in their communities who became unemployed back in 2008 and 2009.  We now have quite a package in place to help these, between the back to work family dividend, JobsPlus and universal children's allowance payments.  Disincentives to returning to work are being removed.  The HAP scheme being rolled out across the country will replace the rent allowance and help remove unemployed people from the poverty trap.  A range of initiatives and assistance is now in place to help the long-term unemployed back into the workforce and I believe this will be successful in coming years.<br\/>It is essential that the ongoing task of economic repair is accompanied by an equal focus on social recovery.  Following a number of budgets which required a major consolidation of the public finances, including social protection expenditure, budget 2015 provides that all social welfare payments and supports will be maintained during 2015.  This means that there will be no reductions in payment levels and no changes in qualifying criteria.  However, the improved economic circumstances have allowed us to go beyond this by providing for the first increases in weekly social welfare payments since 2008.<br\/>The living alone allowance, which is payable to some 180,000 pensioners and people with disabilities, is being increased from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 a week from the beginning of January 2015.  While this is only a small change, it is significant because the payment has not changed since 1996.  This payment recognises that people living alone have additional expenditure.  It costs as much to heat a room for one as it does for two.  This is acknowledged through this increase.  We need to monitor the effect of this payment.  People living alone face additional expenditure and a higher cost of living.  This extra payment acknowledges this for the first time since 1996.<br\/>We have also been in a position to partially restore the Christmas bonus this year.  A bonus of 25% was paid last week to all long-term welfare recipients, including pensioners, lone parents, jobseekers, carers and people with disabilities.  Both of these measures are being provided for by way of regulations which have been made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  While these increases are modest in regard to those provided for in the recent past, they are also prudent.  We will not return to the recklessness of the past.  Instead we are using the economic dividend from the recovery to invest in sustainable growth in families and communities and in vital public services.  All Members will acknowledge that the Christmas bonus will go back into the economy and help sustain it.  The moneys paid out this week will be spent over Christmas and is, therefore, an important boost to the economy.<br\/>I am delighted to say that budget 2012 provided for a phased reduction between 2012 and 2016 in the weekly amount of earnings that can be disregarded for the purposes of the one-parent family payment scheme, with the disregard due to fall from &euro;90 to &euro;75 next year and to &euro;60 in 2016.  I am pleased that it has been possible to provide for the retention of the weekly earnings disregard for recipients of one-parent family payment at its present level of &euro;90 a week.  This measure will benefit some 28,000 working recipients of one-parent family payments during 2015, at a cost of &euro;8 million.  In addition, the back to work family dividend will be a significant financial assistance to lone parents looking to return to work.<br\/>Given the scale of the economic downturn and the unparalleled levels of unemployment, supporting the protection and creation of jobs has been a major priority for the Government.  A key element of this is supporting people to move from welfare into employment.  One of my main priorities as Minister of State with responsibility for activation measures is to continue with the transformation of the Department of Social Protection from being a passive benefits provider to one that is actively engaged in assisting jobseekers to return to work, including engagement with employers to them and employees get what they need.  The number of people at work has increased by 84,000 since 2012. <br\/>We talk about reform and change.  The reform that has taken place in our employment offices is only paying a return now.  Our new Intreo centres, which have been developed by our public and civil servants have changed how these offices interact.  They offer a service now.  The first step taken into an Intreo centre is a first step back towards employment.  I pay tribute to the public and civil servants who have retrained, changed and are working actively to help jobseekers to return to employment.  They are also working with employers to match them with the talents of jobseekers.  The Government's primary strategy to reduce long-term unemployment has been, through policies, to create the environment for a strong economic recovery.  Economic growth will underpin jobs growth and this strategy is working.<br\/>This Bill also enables the Minister for Finance to drawn down moneys from the Central Fund to discharge liabilities which may accrue to the State in the event of the wind up of a defined benefit pension scheme in particular circumstances.  These circumstances arise where: both the employer and the scheme are insolvent, which is often referred to as a double insolvency; the date of the wind up of the scheme was on or after 25 January 2007 and before 25 December 2013; and the resources in the scheme are not sufficient to fund a minimum level of benefits.<br\/>The issue of a potential liability on the State arises following two rulings of the European Court of Justice.  The first ruling, which was delivered on 25 January 2007, relates to a UK case - Carol Marilyn Robins and Others<i>v.<\/i>the UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.  The second ruling, which was delivered on 25 April 2013, relates to an Irish case - Hogan and others <i>v. <\/i>the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Ireland and the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>The measure being provided for in the Bill will allow for payment from the Central Fund to be made by the Minister for Finance in circumstances where the State may need to address liabilities that could arise between the date of the Robins judgment which was delivered on 25 January 2007 and the date of enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013, namely, 25 December 2013.<\/p><p>As I know Senators will be aware, Government approval has been given for a mediator set of recommendations to settle the long-running Waterford Crystal pensions case.  Under this settlement, the former workers of Waterford Crystal will receive significant pensions and a tax free lump sum by way of compensation for the delay and stress involved in bringing Irish and European court cases to resolve the matter.  In addition to the measures contained in the Bill, a number of administrative measures are being put in place and will be finalised early in the new year, with a view to having lump sums paid as early as possible in 2015 and pension payments starting by the middle of the year.  The settlement will include all 1,774 deferred members of the Waterford Crystal staff and factory pension schemes and encompass the families of some members who have, unfortunately, died since the company went into receivership.  These arrangements are subject to the workers balloting on and accepting the proposals.  I hope the measures will bring security and peace of mind for pensioners in the certain knowledge that their pension entitlements are now secure.<\/p><p>I will now address the specific measures contained in the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the definition of common terms which are used for the purposes of the Bill.  The &quot;Principal Act&quot; means the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the &quot;Act of 2012&quot; means the Social Welfare Act 2012.<\/p><p>Section 2 provides for a &euro;5 increase in the monthly rate of child benefit, bringing the current rate up from &euro;130 to &euro;135 with effect from 1 January 2015.  The section also provides that in the case of twins, the monthly rate of child benefit will increase from &euro;195 to &euro;202.50 per child, while in the case of multiple births of three or more children, the monthly rate of child benefit will increase from &euro;260 to &euro;270 per child, with effect from 1 January 2015.<\/p><p>Section 3 provides for the retention of the weekly earnings disregard for recipients of one parent family payment at its current level of &euro;90.  <\/p><p>Section 4 provides for the drawdown of moneys from the Central Fund by the Minister for Finance for making payments to approved persons to discharge the liabilities of an eligible pension scheme.  An eligible pension scheme is one where the scheme was wound up between 25 January 2007 and 25 December 2013; the employer is insolvent; and the resources of the scheme are insufficient to discharge certain defined liabilities.  <\/p><p>Section 5 provides for the Short Title and construction of the Bill and collective citations.<\/p><p>Despite the need to stabilise the public finances in recent years, the social welfare system continues to have a key role to play in society.  We have made substantial progress in repairing the enormous damage done to the economy.  We must now ensure we provide assistance for people who have become unemployed through no fault of their own.  This is the first budget to put money back into people's pockets.  I recognise nevertheless that many difficulties remain.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100024#Y00700","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418306100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys.  <\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the Bill which provides for a 50% correction in the &euro;10 cut in child benefit introduced in 2012.  We also support the legislative provisions which finally settle the long-running Waterford Crystal pensions dispute.  I regret, however, that the Bill does not disguise the fact that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has serious questions to answer about the manner in which cuts have been implemented.  The budget 2015 announcements restore only a small fraction of the reductions introduced since 2012.<\/p><p>On 12 October 2012 the Minister stated: &quot;We are committed to maintaining the basic, core social welfare rates.&quot;  Notwithstanding her promise, she subsequently cut child benefit, reduced the period of entitlement to jobseeker's benefit from nine months to six, dramatically cut jobseeker's allowance for everyone under 25 years to &euro;100 per week, impoverished pensioners by filleting the household benefits package and abolishing the telephone allowance, cut the back to school allowance for clothing and footwear and reduced the respite care grant for carers by 25%.  This is not a legacy of which the T&aacute;naiste can be proud.  I say this with regret, rather than as outright criticism.  <\/p><p>According to Social Justice Ireland, 16% of adults living in poverty are employed.  These are the working poor and I suggest a significant number of them took part in yesterday's demonstration, not necessarily to protest about Irish Water but to oppose the Government's austerity programme to which they have been subjected in recent years.  It is rather interesting that the T&aacute;naiste's decision to abolish the weekly &euro;100 PRSI allowance has resulted in an anomaly, whereby lower paid workers will take home less pay when they earn more.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware that Ireland is obliged under European law to pay child benefit to the children of non-Irish nationals living here.  While this is a reciprocal obligation across all European Union member states, Irish rates of child benefit are high in comparison with those in other countries.  The welcome increase of &euro;5 per month will increase Ireland's standing in the relevant international index.  I ask a question about the financial impact of this obligation on the Department.  I understand that, as of 8 December last, the obligation applies to 4,793 customers and 7,668 children and that the amount paid out from 1 January to 30 November 2013 was &euro;10,856,950.  This is a significant amount of money, as the Minister of State will no doubt agree.  I have no difficulty with the principle of paying child benefit to children of non-Irish nationals in this country.  Irish citizens resident in other EU countries benefit from the same provision, although not to the same degree.  Are moves under way in the European Union to change the position in this regard?<\/p><p>Sentiment is shifting on the package of social welfare benefits being paid to transient populations across EU member states.  As the Minister of State will be aware, I raised on the Adjournment the recent Dano case in Germany, which provides further evidence that change is taking place.  Change is not always in the best interests of the vulnerable and less well-off and I do not advocate changes that will affect the vulnerable.  Nevertheless, the current position raises questions.  It is fine that non-Irish nationals resident here whose children are living in their home country receive child benefit.  The disparity between the rate of child benefit paid in this country and the rates paid in the countries from which non-national recipients come is significant.  The Irish child benefit rate is almost as high as the weekly wage in some of the countries in question.  I raise this issue because money is still tight in the Department and the Minister is clearly considering a range of options to save money.  Is the Government changing its position on this issue?  I suggest sentiment is changing on the issue, although this may simply reflect the language used by the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, as we receive most of our news from the United Kingdom, rather than Germany, France and so forth.  I am curious about this matter. <\/p><p>I commend the Department for continuing to focus on minimising social welfare fraud and abuse.  Work in this area generated control savings of &euro;632 million in 2013.  During the lifetime of the previous initiative which started in 2011 and concluded in 2013, more than &euro;1.9 billion was achieved in control savings, a considerable sum in the context of an overall budget of almost &euro;20.5 billion.<\/p> <p>The figure for the Department is almost &euro;2 billion.  I understand from listening to the Minister recently that one of the reasons there has been a slight loosening of the purse-strings in some other Departments is because of the savings in the Department of Social Protection budget as a result of increased employment as well as other fraud control measures.  It is within that overall package that I raise the issue in the context of this legislation.  I realise it does not impact directly on the Bill but it is akin to it and perhaps the Minister of State has some views on the matter.  I appreciate that I am throwing the Minister of State a curveball today but he may have some views.  Perhaps he will agree that the topic is at least worth reassessing and considering.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State will also provide the House with an overview of the European perspective on the issue of the totality of social welfare benefits.  The Minister of State knows better than me that the social protection budget is one of the highest in the entirety of Government expenditure which, I gather, is of the order of &euro;55 billion this year.  Therefore, a budget of &euro;20 billion from that total is considerable.  That is why I am making the point.  I am mindful that the Department is constantly looking at ways to minimise loss or waste.  I ought to choose my words carefully.  I am not suggesting that the payment of child benefit to people living in other EU countries is a waste but I am simply asking whether in the current economic climate it is worthy of reassessment and whether this view is growing within the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100026#AA00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418306700,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, to the House.  Before discussing the positive measures in the proposed legislation, I imagine the Minister of State, along with all of us, welcomes the news of the discussions involving the former staff members of Waterford Crystal which have been successfully concluded.  Amendments to relevant legislation were passed as part of discussion on the matter in the Lower House.  There is no need for me to go over that issue again, save to say that it is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>It is a welcome change to be discussing a social welfare Bill that is increasing the level of supports the State provides to people.  The people have stood with us, sometimes with gritted teeth, during all the harsh but necessary measures that the Government has had to introduce during the past four years.  At every turn the Opposition has behaved as if no cuts in any services were warranted and every taxation measure was an outrage.  It is easy to be in opposition in such circumstances.  I did not envy the Minister or her Cabinet colleagues the job of making the books balance especially when we were locked out of the international financial markets.  I commend the Minister on staying the course and helping to turn our country's finances around.  I have no doubt that the actions of the Minister and her colleagues as well as the wider Fine Gael and Labour Party membership will be seen in future as having saved our country from utter chaos.  I do not say as much lightly.<\/p><p>Our economic recovery is gathering pace.  Our unemployment rate which is currently at 10.7% is below the European average and falling.  The Exchequer returns are impressive.  Our growth rate is the highest in Europe.  Given that the State was three months from running out of cash when this Government came to power that is a remarkable achievement.  However, it is important to note that many people have not yet experienced these benefits.  To that end the major provisions of this year's social welfare Bill are welcome.  We are starting to give back to people what was taken from them by the financial mismanagement of the previous Administration.  Allowing families to retain the full qualified child increase of &euro;29.80 per week per child for 12 months after a return to work and to retain 50% of the payment in the second year is a positive development.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on committing an additional &euro;2 million to the school meals scheme.  A presentation by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice of examples of social welfare-dependent households and their food spend suggests that a one-parent family with children aged ten and 15 years would spend an average of &euro;123.24 on food or 38.1% of the income.  In the circumstances such an increase in the school meals system is welcome and should help levels of food poverty.<\/p><p>The reduction in the children's allowance payment in previous years was a tough call and I am pleased that the Minister has partially reversed that decision in this year's budget as well as making a commitment to restore it if the public finances allow.  This year's increase of &euro;5 per child will affect almost 613,000 families throughout the country.  Additionally, the increase to &euro;9 per week in the living alone allowance is a positive step and will assist in a small way those experiencing isolation.  Given the part of the country where I am from I urge the Minister of keep this under review.  Much of our recovery is bypassing rural Ireland.  The partial restoration of the Christmas social welfare bonus with a commitment to further increases over time is also a welcome development not only for those in receipt of it but also, as the Minister of State said, for the economy.  This is because the extra payment will be spent in local shops and supermarkets throughout the country.  Much of the recovery to date is macro rather than micro and we need to bring everyone along the way to recovery rather than leaving anyone behind, as happened during the so-called Celtic tiger.  This part of our recovery should be about rebuilding a society rather than simply rebuilding an economy.  This budget is the start of that process and I know the Minister shares my view in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100027#BB00200","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1418306700,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I offer my best wishes to the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach with their important work in the North.  The Minister of State outlined in his speech several positive changes that have come about since the Minister has taken charge of the Department of Social Protection to help families, get people back to work as well as welfare increases, especially the supports for employment and activation.  I acknowledge these significant measures.  They are the result not of piecemeal changes but because of a fundamental reform vision that is at work.<\/p><p>I welcome the modest raise - the Minister of State used the same term - in child benefit and the projected plan to raise this further in 2016.  This is a recognition of the rise in cost of living and the cost of raising children in Ireland.  While the increases are welcome I know the Minister of State will be aware, as will the T&aacute;naiste, that it does not begin to meet the costs associated with raising a child, especially in light of the remarkably high child care costs in Ireland, which average at approximately &euro;800 to &euro;1,000 per month.  This is a modest increase brought about in the context of no other significant measures, for example, tax relief in child care or investment in early years education and care.  It is important to see the increase in the context of the lack of investment and other aspects of ensuring that all children receive the best possible start.  Other Senators have mentioned that the measure should be set in the context of cuts to this payment during the past five years.  The cuts since 2009 amount to &euro;400 million.  Given inflation, increased property taxes and eventual water charges the measure outlined by the Bill, worth approximately &euro;70 million, could have been more generous.  Indeed other child investment measures could have been adopted.<\/p><p>Having said that, the universal child benefit payment is the only payment that recognises the cost and value of care of our children in our society.  It is incremental but it is only incremental by beginning to balance the gender income gap that widened during the austerity years.  I imagine the Minister of State is familiar with the ESRI report which highlighted that women in couples experience a loss of approximately 14% in income levels as against 9% for men in couples.  The cut in child benefit, which is usually received by the mother, was recognised as a key driver of this difference combined with the cuts in public services.  The income disadvantage follows women through their work life and into their pension years and the gender income gap remains between men and women in pension age.  It is concerning that many older women in Ireland are living in poverty.  For this reason I am disappointed that there has been no progress in regard to the homemaker's scheme in the budget since the changes to the number of contributions needed to receive a full pension rose from 260 to 520 in 2012.  This policy has disproportionately affected women.  For historical and current reasons, women continue to have fewer contributions than men.<\/p> <p>When the changes were made, there were promises that this policy would be balanced by changes to the homemaker's scheme, but they have not been implemented.  I refer to the homemaker's disregard and the homemaker's credit advocated by the National Women's Council of Ireland.  The council makes a strong recommendation for the introduction of a homemaker's credit and states the scheme for the homemaker's disregard should apply from 1974, rather than 1994, as it stands.  This would be of benefit to many women now reaching pension age.  I support these recommendations and it is important that we address these issues now to ensure inequality is not embedded in the pensions system.  Perhaps it is more accurate to say inequality is embedded in the pensions system and must be rooted out.<\/p><p>These issues emphasise the importance of gender-proofing and inequality-proofing public policy.  It is very positive that the T&aacute;naiste is engaged in a social impact assessment of policies, as many civil society groups recognise and acknowledge.  We need to encourage this approach across other Departments and I do not doubt that the T&aacute;naiste says this at the Cabinet table.  We must ensure stronger gender-proofing and inequality-proofing measures in the budget process, but the partial roll-back on child benefit reductions does not make up for the lack of affordable and accessible child care services.  As the Minister of State knows well, the cost of child care is one of the most prohibitive barriers when it comes to the participation of women in employment, which is the most effective path out of poverty.  Talk of early years education and care should relate not only to jobs but also to quality of care.  We must speak about the importance of providing all children with the right of equal access to educational opportunities.<\/p><p>Early years education is expensive, although providers try to keep costs as low as possible, especially in the non-profit sector, and, because of this, many children are denied access to such education.  This causes disadvantage and can affect children up to secondary level.  Many parents feel compelled to enrol children in schools earlier than necessary for financial reasons - an additional year in early years education costs approximately &euro;12,000.  The current system is not in the best interests of children and as it does not promote equality, it must be addressed.<\/p><p>Child poverty is a major issue in Ireland and particularly affects children in one parent families who suffered owing to austerity budgets.  I am happy that cuts to the lone parent income disregard which were to take effect in January 2015 and 2016 have been frozen, as this is a significant achievement.  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste and her Department on this decision and hope the unfair cuts that affect 28,000 of the poorest households and children will be reversed fully.<\/p><p>The back-to-work family dividend expected in another social welfare Bill will be welcomed because these are not piecemeal changes but part of a wider vision.  We must examine the situation of families when the benefit period expires, as many women availing of the scheme may still be on very low incomes after the first one and a half years in employment.  I draw on the work of the National Women's Council of Ireland in calling for an extension of the qualified child payment which is paid to families in receipt of certain social welfare benefits, low income families that receive family income supplement.  This could provide the support and incentive that families need to remain in employment.<\/p><p>I would like to see the habitual residency condition removed from child benefit, as advocated by FLAC and others, because child benefit should be a universal payment to all children living in Ireland.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which was ratified by Ireland provides that state parties must respect and ensure the rights of children, including the right to benefit from social security without discrimination.  I strongly believe children living in Ireland should not be treated differently because of their parents' status or lack thereof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100027#BB00300","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418307300,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate in the absence of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who is in Belfast to engage in very important talks in which I wish her well.<\/p><p>For the first time since I was elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann I see a social welfare Bill that gives something back to people, rather than merely adjusting qualifying criteria.  This is a welcome development and an indication that Ireland's economic and social recovery is showing positive signs.  It also shows that the Department's drive and policies to get people back to work are having positive effects.  The Department is investing over &euro;1 billion a year in employment supports and this must be welcomed, as the more people we get back into permanent, sustainable employment the better it will be for the economy.  The knock-on effect is that fewer people will need social welfare payments.<\/p><p>Budget 2015 has a number of positive social welfare elements, some of which will be introduced through new legislation and some through amendments to existing legislation.  I very much welcome the increase in child benefit; it is a modest increase, but if it had been a cut of &euro;5, it would have been portrayed as a huge amount.  Any increase is welcome.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, committed in the Seanad to not cutting child benefit any further until safe and affordable child care provisions were in place.  In fairness to her, she has honoured this commitment and gone further by increasing child benefit.<\/p><p>It concerns me that there has been a very poor uptake of the after-school child care programme.  In the budget for 2014 the T&aacute;naiste allocated &euro;14 million to provide 6,000 after-school child care programme places.  Will the Minister of State update us on how this programme is proceeding?  It is hard to believe the uptake has been poor when parents are crying out for after-school child care services.<\/p><p>I have a proposal for the Minister of State and hope he will pass it on to the T&aacute;naiste in order that she can put it to the Cabinet.  This morning on the Order of Business my colleague, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, raised the issue of Childline and said its night service was to cease owing to a lack of funding.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the T&aacute;naiste to use the money not spent on the 6,000 after-school child care places on a once-off payment to ensure Childline's night service continues.  What better way to spend this money than on a service for children?  Please discuss this proposal with the T&aacute;naiste and, if she agrees, she might take it to the Cabinet for approval.<\/p><p>I particularly welcome the amendment relating to the one parent family payment and the halting of the proposed reduction in the disregard of income.  I know of many parents who are on their own, working part time to facilitate school hours and have a mortgage to provide accommodation for their families.  They are balancing mortgage repayments based on the one parent family payment, income from employment and family income supplement.  They work hard to earn an income and provide a stable home for their children.  The halting of the reduction is a positive move and I am glad that the Government finances made it possible.  I am also glad that there has been a commitment to stop a further planned reduction next year.<\/p><p>It is great to see the restoration of 25% of the Christmas bonus, as it gives a little back to those dependent on social welfare payments.  Many used to look forward to the Christmas bonus to buy a little extra at Christmas time.  <\/p><p>There has been an increase in the living alone allowance for the first time since 1996.  This is the first increase in 19 years, despite the fact that many of those years were good ones, with plenty of money in the country.  I am delighted that the Government has seen fit to increase the allowance because those living alone have the same expenses as anyone else - they must heat their house and pay bills as one would if one shared a house with two or three others.  The increase is small, but it is a move in the right direction.<\/p><p>In conjunction with labour activation measures, the retention of the qualified child payment, the back-to-work dividend, is a very positive move.  It is beneficial to parents who felt they would be only marginally better off in going back to work.  I am delighted that the T&aacute;naiste has confirmed to me that this will not be taken into account when assessing eligibility for family income supplement.  The back-to-work dividend will apply at rates of 100% for the first year and 50% for the second year.  A person should never be better off unemployed than in employment.<\/p> <p>This will be a great help to families and in assisting people to get back to work.  I was concerned when the Minister of State said legislation would not be introduced until April to give effect to this provision, but he counteracted this by saying the legislation would be backdated to 1 January 2015.  I hope we will have the legislation enacted as quickly as possible in the new year.  <\/p><p>I know that labour activation measures are the responsibility of the Minister of State who has clearly outlined in detail all of the schemes available to help to get people back to work or education.  Since his appointment, he has hit the ground running, visiting numerous counties, meeting staff in different offices with responsibility for labour activation schemes such as Intreo offices, local employment service offices, the Employ Ability centres, the partnerships and T&uacute;s.  I know that he is taking a hands-on approach because I accompanied him on some of his visits and know exactly how he is working and what he is doing.<\/p><p>There are many incentives available to help people to get back to work, but I would like to highlight a service that is under the radar.  Many are not aware of the support provided by the nationwide EmployAbility Service.  Just because a person has a disability or an illness does not mean that he or she cannot work.  It is important that people realise this.  The nationwide Employ Ability service provides an employment support service for people with a health condition, an injury, an illness or a disability, as well as a recruitment advice service for the business community.  The local Employ Ability service will provide an employer with employment assistance and access to a pool of potential employees with varying levels of skills, abilities and training; will provide ongoing support for both employer and employee throughout the period of employment; will provide a professional job matching service to help to ensure successful recruitment; and will provide advice and information on additional employment supports.  Many people are not aware of this service which is one that goes under the radar.  It is important to highlight it in order that people with a disability know that they can work and have a life.<\/p><p>Senator Paschal Mooney has raised the issue of child benefit being paid to parents whose children do not live in Ireland.  I have raised this issue with the Minister several times.  I have also raised it at the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  I cannot understand why the child benefit payment made to parents whose children live abroad cannot be made at the benefit rate applicable in the country in which the children reside.  If a parent works in Ireland and he or she sends the money to his or her country of origin, surely the payment should be made at the rate that applies where the family lives, not the rate in Ireland. <\/p><p>I am constantly raising the issue of a homemaker's credit, as Senator Katherine Zappone has just done.  I am speaking for people who were affected by the marriage bar and had to resign their jobs.  The homemaker's credit scheme was introduced in 1994 for women who stayed at home.  What is the difference between women who were homemakers before 1994 and those who took on this role after that year?  Now that we have a little funding, these women, some of whom were forced to give up work to look after children and raise a family, are no different from those who are doing this today and in receipt of the homemaker's credit.  I ask the Minister of State to took at this issue again, as most of the women in question are coming up to pension age and will only be eligible for a reduced pension.  <\/p><p>The Acting Chairman is indicating that I should finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100028#CC00200","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418307900,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I have given the Senator a good deal of leeway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100029#DD00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1418307900,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is most welcome.  It was good to hear the good news that the Government had to give, particularly on the unemployment figures.  The rate of unemployment has come down from 15.1% in early 2012 to 10.7%, which is particularly good when compared to the recent unemployment figure in Spain of 24.4%.<br\/>Senator Paschal Mooney raised the issue of the rate of child benefit that should be applied to families whose children do not live here.  It has been very well worded.  The Minister of State said: &quot;Child benefit helps to prevent poverty, along with other child income supports paid to welfare recipients and low paid working families.&quot;  I do not agree with the decision reached by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection in ruling out a means test for child benefit, even though this has been called for in several reports.  It is a waste of money to give the benefit to high earners and the Minister of State is right to refer to low paid working families.  It is a clear example of something that would not happen in the private sector when something could be done about an issue.  Last year it was reported that Ireland had eight billionaires and 20,000 millionaires.  I am not sure how true these figures are, but only three families handed back their children's allowance payments.  According to a report in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, &quot;If a parent does not wish to claim their child benefit payment, they can notify the Department of Social Protection in writing to that effect and their claim will be stopped in accordance with their wishes&quot;.  That seems to be a very old-fashioned system which obviously is not working.  Will the Minister create a website to enable people to give back their payments more easily?  Surely in the era of computerisation and PPS numbers, this could be done easily.  Such a system could save the State money if the Government was not willing to means test the payment.  Will the Minister of State comment on this idea, as it would be a very sensible move?  <br\/>I recognise that the Government has reduced child benefit rates for successive children, but I wonder if the number of children in a family for whom child benefit is received should be capped?  In Switzerland the payment of child benefit depends on the region in which one lives, but it is usually around &euro;150 per child per month.  However, in most regions the payment of child benefit is stopped after the second child.  I understand there is a similar system in place in the United States.  I know that this will not sound popular in a country that traditionally has had large families.  We have 16 grandchildren, but I do not think my wife and I have more than five children.  I understand that with the increase in child benefit under the Bill, a person with eight children will now receive &euro;1,080 per month as opposed to the previous payment of &euro;1,040.  In Switzerland a parent with eight children would still receive a total of &euro;300.  I feel guilty in saying this, but I wonder if the payment should be capped and only made in respect of a certain number of children?  I do not know and I am sure this would not have been acceptable in the past.<br\/>I also wonder if the total amount paid to a single parent household should be capped to ensure those who rely on welfare payments do not earn more than the average working family.  That is something the Government in the United Kingdom has considered.  Does the Minister of State agree with this sentiment or does the Government believe there should be no cap?<br\/>I know that the Bill introduces the back-to-work family dividend to provide an additional incentive for families to move from welfare to work.  That is a very worthy initiative which will mean that persons will be able to retain some of their child benefit payment in order to make it more attractive for them to take a job.  The new support will also be available to single parents and many unemployed parents who were previously self-employed or working in the construction sector.  That is also a very good initiative.  <br\/>I take the opportunity to ask the Minister of State about the incentives to encourage people to start their own business.  This has a very big part to play in getting people off social welfare payments.  The short-term enterprise allowance and the back-to-work enterprise allowance give support to unemployed persons who want to start their own business.  Will the Minister of State outline how many have availed of this and similar schemes?  Also, will he state the number of new businesses that have been set up and how many have lasted for more than one year?  It would be interesting to get feedback on these novel ideas.  <br\/>One of the massive barriers in getting back to work, particularly for women, is the cost of child care, which is among the highest in Europe.  We have heard this issue referred to so often.  I suggest the benefit be linked with subsidising the cost of child care instead of being a cash payment.  There are other examples which are worth noting.  In Denmark families pay up to 25% of the cost of day care services, with those on low incomes or single parents paying nothing or up to 25% of the cost.There are also discounts for siblings and the government makes up the difference.<\/p> <p>I think that at the very least, we could consider a tax credit for child care.  This would encourage people, particularly women, back to work, may even get highly experienced older women back into work as childminders and could have the effect of reducing the amount of people on the dole.  <\/p><p>Would the Minister consider the example of the UK where parents can claim up to &pound;100 per week to cover child care?  I think the fees are very good points to start from as I believe the cost of child care is forcing many parents to stay at home.  Why would one work if one had to pay for travel, child care, etc., when one could earn a similar amount and stay at home with one's child?  The latter is a much more rational choice and by subsidising child care, we would make a job a much more attractive proposition.<\/p><p>I also welcome the additional money allocated to JobPath which the Minister of State mentioned.  This programme is targeted towards the long-term unemployed, that is, people who have been out of work for over 12 months.  Could we also look at people who have been unemployed for over ten years?  Do we have figures on them?  This is a group to which the Government needs to give targeted assistance.  It is also worth noting that the UK has introduced a scheme specifically for people who have been out of work for over two years.  It is called the Help to Work scheme.  The rules in the UK state that jobseekers who have been out of work for over two years will only receive their benefits if they either show up at a job centre every day or commit to six months of voluntary work.  It means that jobseekers who lack experience or skills will be expected to tackle part in community projects such as tending parks or face losing their handouts under the new Help to Work scheme.  Those who fail to comply with the rules, which also offer signing up to a training scheme as a third option, will have their jobseeker's allowance docked for four weeks for a first offence and 13 weeks for the second.  The idea behind unpaid community work is that it will help the long-term unemployed to learn the discipline of observing office hours and becoming part of a team.  While these measures seem harsh, the UK government says that the rules are needed to help the long-term unemployed.  I think the lesson from this example is that we should treat those long-term unemployed very differently from those who are out of work for several years and that perhaps more incentives are needed for the latter group of people.  In particular, the Government should probably identify those people who are out of work for more ten years as they need more specific assistance to get them off social welfare and back into the workplace.  I have been involved for a little while with the Springboard scheme.  This scheme takes graduates with a high level of skills which are not being used at the moment and helps them to acquire different skills.  I think a similar kind of thinking could take place in this case.  I welcome the Minister and I welcome the Bill as, in general, it is going in the right direction.  Let us make sure we keep our eye on it and enthuse those decision makers to make sure that this continues.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100029#DD00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418308500,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2014 gives legislative effect to one of the social protection measures announced in the Budget Statement of 14 October 2014 which are due to take effect from 1 January 2015, for example, the increase in the monthly rate of child benefit.  This Bill also provides for the retention of the weekly earnings disregard for recipients of one parent family payment at its current level of &euro;90 and the draw down of moneys from the Central Fund by the Minister for Finance for making payments to approved persons in order to discharge the liabilities of an eligible pension scheme.  Section 1 provides for the definition of common terms that are used for the purposes of the Bill.  The term &quot;Principal Act&quot; means the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the term &quot;Act of 2012&quot; means the Social Welfare Act 2012.<br\/>As the Minister of State said in his statement, section 2 provides for a &euro;5 increase in the monthly rate of child benefit bringing the current rate from &euro;130 to &euro;135 with effect from 1 January 2015.  This section also provides that in the case of twins, the monthly rate of child benefit will increase from &euro;195 per child to &euro;202.50 per child,  while in the case of multiple births of three or more children, the monthly rate of child benefit will increase from &euro;260 per child to &euro;270 per child with effect from 1 January 2015.  I am not too sure how often that will happen but it is nice to provide for it.  <br\/>Section 4 enables the Minister for Finance to draw down moneys from the Central Fund to discharge liabilities which may accrue to the State in the event of the wind up of a defined benefit pension scheme in particular circumstances.  These circumstances arise where both the employer and the scheme are insolvent, which is often referred to as a double insolvency; the date of the wind up of the scheme was on or after 25 January 2007, which is the date on which a ruling was given by the European Court of Justice in the UK case of Carol Marilyn Robins and Others <i>v.<\/i>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and before 25 December 2013, which is the date on which the changes provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 were enacted; and the resources in the scheme are not sufficient to fund a minimum level of benefits.  Section 5 provides for the short title and construction of the Bill and for collective citations.<br\/>The increase in the monthly rate of child benefit, which has already been referred to by the Minister of State and previous colleagues and which is provided for in section 2 of the Bill, will cost &euro;72 million in 2015.The retention of the weekly earnings disregard applying to recipients of one parent family payment, as provided for in section 3 of the Bill, will cost &euro;8 million in 2015.<br\/>Budget 2015 provided for a number of social protection measures, some of which relate to statutory schemes and which need to be implemented by way of legislative amendment, while other measures relate to non-statutory schemes and do not require any legislative change.  Of the various social protection measures announced in budget 2015, four of these measures relate to statutory social welfare payments and will need to be implemented by way of legislative amendment.  Two of these measures - the increase in the living alone allowance which is effective from the beginning of January 2015 and the payment of a Christmas bonus, which has already been referred to by the Minister of State and other colleagues - must be addressed.  Two of these measures can be legislated for by way of regulation and the necessary Regulations have been made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  The other two legislative measures require amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  <br\/>In addition to the increase in the monthly rate of child benefit being provided for in this Bill, budget 2015 also announced the introduction of a new back to work family dividend to provide an additional incentive for families to move from welfare to work, which is most welcome.  I understand that the necessary administrative and technical details of this dividend are currently being developed but will not be finalised in time for inclusion in this Bill.  The required legislative amendments for this dividend will be provided for in a further social welfare Bill to be introduced early in 2015 with a view to its enactment by the end of March 2015.  While the dividend will come into operation in early April 2015, it is worth noting that payment of the dividend will be back-dated to the beginning of January in the case of families taking up employment after that date.  The other social protection measures which were announced in budget 2015 relate to non-statutory schemes and do not require any legislative amendments.  <br\/>I will conclude with the question of social welfare tourism.  How extensive is it?  Have we curtailed what was at one stage a significant issue for us?  Have we eliminated it?  Are there any savings we have made?  Does it still happen?  Coming from a Border county, I would ask myself whether there was anybody coming to the South via Belfast.  <\/p> <p>I am not saying they are not entitled to claim, but when people can leave it for a month or two, I am not sure they need it.  The same goes for those who fly in from far-off places to claim it.  <\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister of State every success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100030#EE00200","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418309100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>As always, the Minister of State is very welcome.  <br\/>I welcome the Bill, in particular the increase in child benefit, the introduction of the back-to-work family dividend, the increase in the living alone allowance and the Christmas bonus and, in particular, the retention of the earnings disregard for one parent families and the doubling of JobsPlus payments.  <br\/>I add to the appeal of Senator Marie Moloney that, if there are savings in the case of after-school clubs, perhaps Childline, as the service for children that provides support for them, might benefit.  The difficulty is that there are no Government standards for after-school clubs or how the funding is to be paid.  There is a lack of consistency and quality around the country because the Government is not stating what regulations it wants to see applied to after-school clubs.  These clubs are very important and we should have them in place, but the Government has to give a direction, or else we will have to wait several years, as happened in the child care system - for a crisis to happen and then do something about it.<br\/>I very much welcome that clarity has been provided in the case of Waterford Crystal.  I cannot imagine what it must have been like for individual workers.  It is great to be part of something so positive and the timing is very important.<br\/>The difficulty for me is that when we were making cuts, some of which I supported with a heavy heart, as I do not like to make any cut, we were given a narrative about the importance of services.  We were quoted the first report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare on child and family income support which stated: &quot;The Group recognises that child income support payments cannot be viewed in isolation from other State supports for children such as education, health services and childcare&quot;.  We were encouraged not to always look at CAF transfers but instead to invest in services because that was where we would achieve the quality outcome.  For example, the OECD's 2014 report shows that Ireland is now the most expensive country in the OECD and one of the two most expensive countries in the world for child care, yet we have the lowest rates of investment in Europe in child care services.  The report states a family with two children spend 40% of their average wage on child care costs, whereas the average in the OECD is 12%.  No wonder we are high in the ranking.<br\/>A number of Senators, including Senator Paschal Mooney, raised the issue of child care payments if people moved to another country.  The difficulty is that in other countries the benefits are availed of through services.  Whether it is through health, education or child care services, the investments are made in order that citizens can get the benefit.  I certainly concur with Senator Katherine Zappone on the habitual residence condition.  For me, every child in the country is, first and foremost, a child and the idea that we put an artificial bar in place and say we have this habitual residence condition is unacceptable and needs to be addressed.  In the recent UNICEF report Ireland was in the bottom five of 41 developed countries with respect to the impact of the economic crisis on child well-being.  While we can welcome the increase, we have evidence that children in Ireland fared worse than those in other OECD countries.  The vast majority of OECD developed countries were impacted on by the global financial crisis but many of them managed to actually decrease their rate of child poverty in their responses to the crisis, whereas we managed to increase it.  In fact, I agree with the UNICEF Ireland director, Mr. Peter Power, who said:<blockquote>Countries should place the well-being of children at the top of their priorities during economic recessions.  Not only is this a moral obligation, but it is in the long term self-interest of societies.  Children living in poverty are more likely to become impoverished adults and have poor children, creating and sustaining intergenerational cycles of poverty.<\/blockquote>The report found that the rate of child poverty had risen by over 10% between 2008 and 2012.  While that does not cover the period of the Government, we know that there were further cuts made during its time in office; therefore, we can speculate that the position has not improved.  This is very grave and we should be taking note of it.<br\/>We need to look at how we invest.  When I heard about the &euro;5 increase in child benefit, a part of me was happy and I accept that it will make a difference for some families, especially those on low incomes.  However, is it where we want to get to?  That is my difficulty.  During the crisis we were lectured in the House about the importance of investing in services, particularly child care services.  The T&aacute;naiste told us that we needed safe, affordable and accessible child care services in place, similar to those found in Scandinavian countries.  The Minister of State can see I am not happy about this.  While we had previously heard that the issue of a second preschool year would be looked at in 2016, in response to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, told us it would be introduced in 2020 at the earliest.  Everybody is in agreement on its importance, particularly for special needs children, for whom I have made an appeal in the Seanad.  As we know about the importance of a second preschool year, why are we not looking to make this investment?<br\/>The Department of Social Protection has signed up to the whole-of-government policy, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, a policy for children and young people from birth to 24 years.  Its second key goal is achieving their full potential in learning and development, yet it has not been demonstrated to me that we are going to do what we said during the crisis when we took the tough decisions.  As I said, I supported the Minister in making those decisions, but I was lectured that it was all about services.  However, I do not see the money going into the provision of services and we are still cutting our investment in them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100031#FF00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418309100,"counter":232,"content":"<p>It is not very often that I support a Social Welfare Bill, as we certainly were not given that opportunity in the past few years.  However, I am supporting the Bill, not because I think it is fantastic or that the Government has done anything of significance for those on social welfare payments, but because it does provide for some increases for people whom we obviously need to support.<\/p><p>Before I go into the specifics of the Bill, we need to have a bigger and wider debate about poverty and inequality and their relationship not only with the social welfare system but also low pay.  Many people in work cannot, for example, have a good quality of life and cannot afford to pay basic bills.  The concept of a living or a social wage is gaining traction in Europe.  The Government has a commission on low pay which is going to report back on the issue, while I have taken on the responsibility for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of developing an all-party report on the concept of a social wage and low pay and its relationship with public services.  That is the other element in that many people are living in poverty because they do not have access to a home, housing, health care or education services in the manner they would want to have or should have and all of these issues are interrelated.  We need to fundamentally reform the social welfare system.  Obviously, finding a job is the best way to lift a person out of poverty, or at least it is one of the mechanisms for doing so.  It is welcome that more people are in work and that the unemployment figures have come down.  However, in recent weeks the OECD's report showed that Ireland had the second highest number on low pay among OECD countries.  It is an indictment of everyone in the political system that so many people in the State are on low pay and cannot afford to pay basic bills.  This means that we have to transform the system and look at the relationship between social welfare, work, low pay and access to public services.<\/p><p>Obviously, I do not need to remind the Minister of State that what is contained in the Bill is very modest.  It does not make up for many of the cuts imposed not only in the past few years by the Government but also by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government and even the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Governments before it.<\/p> <p>While the &euro;5 increase in child benefit is welcome, it must be put in context.  I will not rehash all of the pre-election promises made by Labour and Fine Gael as it would start a political row that I do not intend to have.  However, I must point out that the Government has cut child benefit over the last number of years.  While we are giving back &euro;5 per child, it must be considered in the context of cuts which ranged from &euro;10 to &euro;47 per month per child.  We must also look at the &euro;100 cut to the annual back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance for poor families, the cut to maternity benefit of &euro;32 per week and the cut in the lone parent income disregard from &euro;146.30 to &euro;90.  As a consequence of the last cut, a lone working mother is down to &euro;28 per week.  During the intervening years, the cost of living has been rising, which has eroded the value of the total child benefit payment further.  That is the context in which many struggling Irish families will assess the value of the measures contained in the Bill.  They must be looked at in the context of all the other cuts that have been put in place.  These are not just cuts in social welfare but pay cuts and cuts in public services, all of which impact on poverty and inequality.<\/p><p>I appreciate that the Government took over a dire economic situation where the country was bankrupt and on its knees.  No one is underestimating the ability of the Government and the State to deal with the very real problems we had, but many, including me, would argue that there was a fairer way.  What one would want coming out of a government cycle is fewer people in poverty and less inequality.  Almost all of the reports we have seen, including the OECD reports and ESRI reports - with the exception of the last one, which gave some positive welcome to the budget in terms of its progressiveness, although that was countered by NERI and other groups - show that many people still live in poverty.  There is still deep inequality and it will only be solved if we start to fundamentally change how we do things.  That must happen through not being afraid to tax wealth - not being afraid to tax those who earn more and use the money and resources we have to ensure that those who are working have decent pay, that those who are not working have a decent standard of living, and, most importantly that we invest in public services.  I say that as we are going into an election in respect of which we can already see auction politics, with tax cuts being promised everywhere.  What about investment in public services and making sure we have enough teachers in schools and nurses and doctors in our hospitals to provide people with access to health care?  Carers and those with disabilities should be provided with the resources they need.  That is the type of debate I would like to see as we move into an election, not solely one on tax cuts, which is my fear.<\/p><p>I welcome the provisions on the ability of the State to compensate the former Waterford Crystal workers.  I warmly welcome those, having done a great deal of work behind the scenes on the issue myself.  I hosted a number of briefings in Leinster House which Government representatives attended.  We worked constructively together and I commend the Minister for moving on an issue on which the previous Government did not move.  While it was down to the workers who took the court case, it is a very good day for all of us when the deal which will hopefully be voted on by the workers has been provided for by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100031#FF00300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418309700,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

I take on board many of the issues raised by Senators Zappone and van Turnhout on child poverty and the need for the Government to do more to address it.  I support strongly a second pre-school year for kids, as there is a real opportunity there to lay a solid foundation and provide a good educational start.  I encourage the Minister of State to fight hard to have resources made available to introduce a second pre-school year next year if at all possible.  We would all be happy to come up with suggestions as to where funds could be found or savings made to facilitate that.<\/p><p>I welcome the reinstatement of 25% of the Christmas bonus.  We would have liked to see a greater restoration but it is a good start.  I have a query, however.  A constituent approached me last Friday in Ballinasloe who asked why, notwithstanding the fact that he had been on disability allowance for about ten years, he had not qualified for the Christmas bonus.  Did he give me incorrect information, or is there a particular issue?  He assured me he has been in receipt of disability allowance for ten years but was not entitled to the bonus.<\/p><p>I support much of what Senator Feargal Quinn said on incentives and encouragement to return to work.  The only way to address poverty is to facilitate everyone who wishes to work to find gainful employment.  I welcome very much the significant level of job creation we have seen but would love us to be in a situation where as many citizens as possible could be offered meaningful and gainful employment.  I wonder often why there are families where no one has worked for two or three generations and whose members never appear to be asked to participate in a community employment or F&Aacute;S scheme.  How does that continue to be the case?  There is an issue there that we need to address.  I welcome very much the back to work family dividend, which is providing up to &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment.  It is a real incentive.  I am glad the self-employed are being considered in this regard.  Many self-employed people lost their jobs through no fault of their own at the end of the boom and are beginning to pick themselves up and create employment, including, in some situations, employment for another person also.<\/p><p>This morning, I was at a very enjoyable function where Mr. Magnus McFarlane-Barrow was honoured.  He is the founder of Mary's Meals, which provides a meal at school for approximately 1 million people in developing countries across the world.  I welcome the increase in the school meals fund by &euro;2 million in the budget.  Unfortunately, many children in our own country come to school without having eaten a meal.  In many cases, the only real food they get in the course of the day is what they get at school.  There are issues there and in many cases it is not because there are inadequate resources going into the house but rather because of poor parenting.  We need to look at that issue also and perhaps apply funding to addressing it.<\/p><p>The general thrust of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill is welcome.  It is a good start and we all welcome the fact that things are improving within the country.

I always find it a pleasure to come to the Seanad for the constructive debate undertaken here.  I find it useful and informative.<\/p><p>Several people, including Senator Moloney, remarked on my comment that the increase in child benefit of &euro;5 was modest and rightly so.  If there had been a decrease it would have been a massive decrease.  Anyway, I recognise that putting &euro;5 back into a mother's pocket or a family's pocket is modest.  It is really an acknowledgement that things have started to turn.  I, along with all members of the Government, would have preferred for it to be more.  That is why we gave a clear indication that if the economic recovery continues as it has to date, there will be an additional &euro;5 in next year's budget announcement.  The idea is to put down a marker to people to show things are turning.  We want to ensure what is best for the citizen.  The word &quot;citizen&quot; is always important and it is not used often enough.  The citizens of the country will start to see the benefit and not only in child support benefits.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout commented on services.  The important thing is the provision of services.  It is critical.  Several Senators commented on the provision of a second year of preschool.  That is important, especially in areas where there is deprivation.  The benefits to young people, children and families are important.<\/p><p>I will try to address as many points as I can without keeping Senators in sleeping bags for the night.  I will go as quickly as I can.  Reference was made to transfer of benefits, in particular the children's allowance.  There are international agreements.  Senator Mooney was quite right to point out that Irish people also benefit from these transfers.  The overall figure given was &euro;11 million, but there are swings and roundabouts in this regard.  What is happening in this area in a constructive manner?  There is a reflective forum to discuss matters of concern to member states.  The issue of the export of child benefits has been placed on the agenda for the forum to discuss in the near future.  The matter is being examined.  Deputy Mooney raised the matter previously when I was in the House.  I hope the Senator will see that notice has been taken and that action and discussions have begun to take place.<\/p><p>Reference was made to poverty and inequality.  An ESRI report has shown that because the Government has been able to maintain core benefits, income inequality has been reduced in the State.  This is very much about people who have lost out.  Higher incomes have come down a little.  Anyway, the fact that we have able to maintain core social welfare benefits has been most beneficial to people.  This is often remarked elsewhere in Europe.  Countries like Portugal, Spain and Greece have been unable to do that.  It is something that the Irish Government has been able to do through the sacrifice of its people.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste has been very proactive in respect of welfare fraud.  I am unsure whether people noticed last week but reference was made to 20 garda&iacute; being transferred to the investigation unit.  While fraud is significant, given the overall budget for social protection it is rather small.  The figures include overpayments as well.  Anyway, we have a duty to the citizen and the taxpayer to ensure money is spent correctly and that there are no people defrauding the system.  After all, at issue is taxpayers' money.  Senators rightly acknowledged the work that the T&aacute;naiste has undertaken in this area in recent years.  We have seen a significant reduction in this regard.<\/p><p>Senators Zappone referred to vision and reform.  Certainly there has been reform.  Like Senator Zappone, I believe reform never comes quick enough.  It is nearly always too slow for people who are on the political wing of Government.  We are always keen for it to take place faster.  There are so many problems and there is so little money at the moment.  Certainly, we would have been far happier if the economy had turned around a little quicker and we would have been able to invest in services, especially for our young people.<\/p><p>I believe that investment in young people is the way to go.  Let us consider the list of priorities.  My priority is always young people, older people and pensioners because as the upturn takes place, they may not be here to benefit.  This is why the T&aacute;naiste was so keen to increase the children's allowance in this budget and to acknowledge that older people and pensioners have taken quite a knock during this recession.  This is why the reinstatement of 25% of the Christmas has been so important.<\/p><p>Reference was made to access to early years education.  Senator Zappone is doing fantastic work in An Cos&aacute;n.  In my constituency the area-based childhood, ABC, programme has been working under Professor Bleach.  This is a good intervention.  We need to consider the expansion of such programmes and make them more accessible to other people, especially in disadvantaged areas.  If these schemes are to be rolled out we need to consider areas of disadvantage to be prioritised.  Certainly I agree with Senator Zappone in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Marie Moloney referred to child care places.  There has been an increase.  I understand 234 have taken up places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100033#HH00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1418310300,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The figure is over 6,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100033#HH00500","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1418310300,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I will get Senator Moloney more precise figures.  Senator Moloney made a good point about employability services.  I launched the employability service when the staff involved moved to the new offices in Galway.  People should consider the difference the service has made.  A number of services are run throughout the country to help people with disability to get into relevant jobs that they like and enjoy, rather than shoving a round hole into a square box.  Fantastic work is under way in this area.  Since becoming Minister of State for activation I have been promoting employability services throughout the country and I hope to visit many more and assist them.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn asked directly about the back-to-work enterprise allowance.  There have been 10,897 recipients of the allowance.  This is about getting people who have been unemployed back to set up their own businesses.  It has been working well.  Senator Quinn will probably be looking at proceedings in his office.  The Intreo offices are assisting people who have been long-term unemployed into employment and the figures are showing this.  The group engagements are working well.  Group engagement services are given to people on the live register who wish to set up their own businesses.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, I would at some stage enjoy having a longer debate about stopping the children's allowance after the second child.  I have it to say that Senator Quinn dodged a bullet.  I disagree with that and I would like to go through the areas and why I would disagree with him.  Anyway, Senator Quinn is not here.  I know he had to go to an important meeting.  It is not that he is not doing other work.<\/p><p>Child care was raised by Senator Quinn as well and I accept that it is a problem.  Work is being carried out by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, in this area.  The issue came up recently at a Cabinet sub-committee.  The Taoiseach has taken quite an interest in this area.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn should note that several services are tackling people who have been quite a distance from the employment market.  These include Gateway and T&uacute;s.  They are actively helping people who are long-term unemployed to get back into work.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Brennan for his remarks and support.  He raised the issue of social welfare fraud.  There is a special investigation unit with 91 offices and 290 inspectors.  Therefore, the Department of Social Protection does not take fraud lightly.  It is actively working on the issue.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane referred to low pay.  I would be very interested in a wider debate on this.  The T&aacute;naiste has appointed the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, to address this issue.  He set up a commission and the discussion is ongoing.  Certainly, we are delivering in this regard.  I very much welcome the commission and look forward to its recommendations.<\/p><p>Under-employment is very much an issue.  I refer to people on 20 and 30-hour contracts.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, will deal with this.  Senator Cullinane said he would not refer to broken promises.  The Government made one very clear promise, namely, that it would get the country back on its feet.  The unemployment rate is now dropping and the number of people employed is growing.  Certainly, the commitment in this regard has been honoured.  Senator Cullinane said he would like to see more people employed in schools.  In the latest budget, 1,700 additional resource places were provided for in the education system.  During the worst years of the recession, we built classrooms rather than prefabs.  There is much to be said for that.<\/p><p>Reference was made to an individual of the disability allowance who was not paid the Christmas bonus.  One will probably find he was on illness benefit.  If he applies for the disability allowance, he may be entitled to it.  We can take this up afterwards if the Senator wants to provide to me the details.<\/p><p>The increase of &euro;2 million for the school meal programme is very welcome.<\/p><p>I brushed over the relevant issues very quickly but we will have a longer engagement on them next week on Committee and Report Stages.  Senators are very much looking forward to that, as am I.  The interaction will be as constructive as I always find it.  I hope to be taking Committee and Report Stages if the T&aacute;naiste cannot do so.

The issue I wish to raise is that of organ donation.  As the Minister knows, the system in Ireland is not all it should be.  For too long, we did not have organ donor co-ordinators.  There are many staff working excellently in the field very much on a voluntary basis.  We were to appoint 20 new staff in this area as part of the HSE's service plan but there was only one line in the plan on organ donation.  When one considers the number of people waiting for an organ donation and the cost to the Exchequer of organ donation, including the cost of dialysis for those in need of kidney transplants, one realises that if we had an improved system, there would be savings to the Exchequer over time.<\/p> <p>We had the Seanad recalled the summer before last.  The night before it happened, two HSE staff members were asked to move to the organ transplant office so that it could be announced in this Chamber that there was activity in the field.  I welcome anything that results in activity and improvements in the field of organ donation.  The appointment of 20 staff, which was to take place in August of this year, is also welcome.  I hope to find out from the Minister what they are doing and what is his vision for organ donation in his term in the Department of Health.<\/p><p>The Minister has come from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and I raised the following issue with that Department.  We are collecting data from our driving licensing system, whereby people tick the box on whether they want to be organ donors, yet the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will not let the Department of Health access the information.  It is a simple process of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport asking people, when people are applying for the driving licence card, if it is okay to share the information with the Department of Health and with doctors in the event of someone being suitable as an organ donor.  It would make the decision for the family so much easier.  We collect the data but it is not shared or is not available to be shared.  Now that the Minister has spanned both Departments, perhaps he has a view on working with his colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I accept we are here to discuss the new staff in the organ donation section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100034#JJ01100","speaker":"1159","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418311200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue of the steps being taken to boost organ donation and transplantation rates in Ireland.  I was very pleased that, in the face of difficult economic circumstances, the Government arranged for the HSE to allocate an additional &euro;2.9 million to organ donation and transplantation in 2014.  This additional investment is a clear demonstration of our commitment to this important issue.  The extra allocation will facilitate the recruitment of 19 whole-time equivalent staff dedicated to organ donation and transplantation.  These comprise four consultants, six organ donation nurse managers, five organ procurement co-ordinators and four quality officers.  Four people are already employed in the new roles and others are at various stages of recruitment.  All posts will be filled next year.<\/p><p>The consultant intensive care posts and the organ donor nurse managers being recruited will form a key element of the organ donation effort in each of the six hospital groups around the country.  Having these people on the ground in hospitals will provide a major boost for organ donation.  The consultants and nurse managers will work to foster a strong culture of organ donation, optimise conversion rates and champion educational strategies and training programmes that promote organ donation to health care professionals across each hospital group.  These key personnel will have a particular focus on protecting the interests of donating families throughout the donation process.  The consent of the next-of-kin will always be sought before organ donation and no organs will be removed without such consent. <\/p><p>We must do everything in our power to comfort, console and counsel families who find themselves in the most difficult of circumstances, having lost a loved one, while encouraging them to agree to donate the organs of their loved one.  Ultimately, organ donation can bring great comfort to grieving families as well as representing a gift of life for others.  In order to reduce the risks and maximise the benefits of transplantation, procurement and transplantation centres must operate an effective framework for quality and safety and this will be led by a dedicated team of quality managers.  A quality manager has been appointed in each of the three transplant hospitals - the Mater, Beaumont and St. Vincent's - and the recruitment of a fourth quality manager for the national organ procurement service is being progressed.<\/p><p>In line with international best practice, the national organ procurement service is being separated from the renal transplant service.  In order to facilitate the separation of donor and recipient co-ordination, five organ procurement co-ordinators are being recruited.  One is already in post, three are to start in early January and the fifth is to start in March.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I assure the House of my commitment to improving our organ donation and transplantation infrastructure.  Organ donation and transplantation is an area of health care that brings so many benefits to the lives of patients and their families.  I am confident this extra investment will facilitate an increase in the levels of organ donation and transplantation, to the benefit of patients and their families, while being a source of some comfort and consolation to the families and friends of the bereaved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100035#KK00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1418311200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply and I welcome the moves made in respect of organ donation and transplantation.

I am due to meet the organ donation team in the new year and it is something I will put on the agenda for discussion.  I imagine there are data protection issues but they could be dealt with because the person, when renewing a licence, could consent to the information being included on a registry.

It is important that they are maintained to remain safe and fit for purpose for all road users, pedestrians and motorists alike.  The cost of maintenance is incredibly expensive and far beyond the owners' ability to pay.  In 2013, a private road servicing family homes in Killarney, County Kerry, cost an estimated &euro;75,000 to repair.  I am sure the Minister of State agrees this is a colossal amount for an individual, group or family to cover for access to property.  While privately owned, such roads are often used by the public.  Council schemes to tar and chip these roads have been discontinued, leaving owners adrift facing mounting and financially crippling costs for roads that are essential to their livelihoods.  This leads to privately owned rural roads falling into disrepair, with potentially dangerous and restrictive consequences for those who use them.  I know of four farm families in Galway East who have limited access to their farmland so that they can go to work and earn a livelihood.  It is having a detrimental impact on their lives and the situation is clearly unfair to owners of privately owned roads.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that county councils are very stretched financially in providing for the existing public road network and are not in a position to cover the costs that might be involved in repairing these roads.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to introduce a generous road improvement scheme to fund private roads and improve road safety throughout the country.  It would offer much-needed relief to the owners of these private roads and those in rural areas who rely on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100035#KK00500","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418311800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I am pleased to reply on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.<br\/>The Minister has responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects are a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  The NRA has no function relating to non-public roads.  With regard to regional and local roads, the improvement and maintenance of those roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<br\/>Due to the national financial position, Exchequer funding for Ireland's roads has fallen radically.  Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion, while funding this year is less than &euro;800 million for the national, regional and local road network.  The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work required.  For this reason the main focus has to be on the maintenance and repair of public roads, and this will continue to be the position for some years to come.<br\/>There is a scheme in place relating to non-public roads.  The local improvement scheme provides funding for roads and laneways that councils have not taken in charge.  However, the maintenance and improvement of these roads is a matter for the relevant landowner.  There is no separate allocation for the local improvement scheme.  Instead, local authorities may use up to 15%, up from 7% in 2013, of their initial discretionary grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes is 20% of the total cost of the project.  It is my understanding that the majority of local authorities opt to focus funding on public roads.  It is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their discretionary grant that they can use for the local improvement schemes with their own resources.<br\/>As I mentioned earlier, the purpose of Exchequer grants is to supplement local authorities' own resources.  It is also a matter for the local authority to agree and prioritise its own work programme for the year.  The Minister believes that local authorities are best placed to judge the priority of works on private roads, taking road safety factors into account.  In this way, local authorities may decide whether they want to operate the local improvement scheme in their areas or would prefer to put their resources into regional and local public roads.  If a separate fund were to be set aside for the local improvement scheme, this would involve making a <i>pro rata<\/i>reduction to the other road grants headings and imposing the scheme on local authorities that would prefer to prioritise public roads.  The Minister does not favour such an approach.  He will be announcing the 2015 road grants in January.<br\/>Last year this scheme was abolished and I fought hard to get it reinstated.  I also managed to increase the percentage from 7% to 15% last year.  The local authorities have their own discretionary money and the Senator should find out what Galway County Council uses for its discretionary money.  In fact, it uses the grant aid it gets from the Government instead of using some of its own funding.  In some cases, local authorities, including my own, are great at finding money for travelling the world and for events within the councils.  The Senator should ask her local authority to prioritise this matter.  I will continue to push to get whatever funding I can, because I support this scheme.  People in rural areas have private roads which in reality are not private roads but public roads that have not yet been taken in charge by the county councils.  I would like the Government to provide more funding for the scheme, but so should the local authorities.  They are great for creaming off the money themselves, but they should put some of it into roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100036#LL00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1418311800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on his efforts in regard to local roads, particularly private roads, and getting that scheme in place.

There is a rumour - which appears to have some foundation - that has angered landowners, many of whom are farmers.  The rumour is that lands could be acquired by compulsory purchase order, CPO, if necessary.  My proposal is that the only way to move on this project is by agreement with the landowners.  Perhaps the Minister would outline the anticipated procedure, including the appeals process, for acquiring the lands.<\/p><p>The backdrop to this is that approximately a month ago 12 local landowners in Maree, Oranmore, where I live, and in the general area of Clarinbridge contacted me to say they had received a letter from the NRA stating that a proposed route for the greenway goes through their lands.  I was a little dismayed that I, as a local public representative, did not receive a letter on the same matter.  There was a lack of information in respect of informing local public representatives.  However, we have moved on from that.<\/p><p>I attended a meeting in the Loughrea Hotel &amp;amp; Spa last week.  Approximately 250 landowners were present and probably 99% of them were farmers, but to a man and a woman there was 100% disagreement with the acquisition of lands by CPO.  The general view was that this greenway is a great idea in principle, but if it is to work in practice, lands must be acquired by agreement with landowners.  Second, where possible, public lands should be used.  I have met with representatives of both the NRA and local farmers.  I am working in the Maree, Oranmore, Clarinbridge and Roscam area to reach agreement on this project and to move it on by helping to work out a route that is agreeable to everybody.  The 250 landowners are all opposed to it unless it is done by agreement.  That is a considerable number.  The project will never get off the ground unless there is goodwill.  One can understand the use of CPOs for critical infrastructure such as the M6, and even that was difficult.  This, however, is what I would classify as desirable infrastructure.  We will not die if we do not get a greenway.  We are aware that it would bring tourism benefits and that tourism spreads money across the economy, but the only way to proceed is by agreement with the landowners.  It is great in principle, but it must work in practice.<\/p><p>Farmers and people in rural areas are annoyed because they feel they have been walked on.  As they said, the rural schools have been hit and there has been a flat domestic economy, so they wonder why this is now being imposed on them.  Let us not scupper what is potentially a great project by angering farmers.  There are practical issues involved.  I do not know if the Minister will be able to address them in his response, but he is a sensible man and he would understand them.  What about insurance and liability?  The first thing the NRA mentioned to the Galway farmers, which was stupid beyond measure, was that it had surveyed German tourists and found that they wanted this greenway.  It could have said it had surveyed European tourists and found that they were interested in cycling and that a greenway would be a way of attracting tourists.  I am aware of the popularity of the greenway from Achill to Westport.  That is wonderful, because it utilised a disused rail line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100036#LL00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1418311800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100036#LL00600","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1418311800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>It used an existing route, but the Minister can refer to that.<\/p><p>The point is that we must ensure issues such as insurance and liability are covered and there is nothing in that regard that could affect people's private property.

I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.<\/p><p>The proposed Dublin to Galway national greenway is an ambitious plan to develop a 280 km dedicated cycle route that will meander through the towns and villages of Ireland's heartland while offering a unique connection between these two coastal cities.  Planning for the proposed Dublin to Galway cycle route is currently being carried out by the National Roads Authority, NRA and the National Transport Authority, NTA, with planning approval now in place for the entirety of the route between Maynooth and Athlone.  The NTA is responsible for the provision of cycling infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and is therefore proceeding with the planning of the Dublin city centre to Maynooth section of the proposed route.  The Royal Canal is the intended route for this section of the cycle way.  A section of the route from Ashtown to Castleknock was opened earlier this year with funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NTA.  <\/p><p>The NRA is currently undertaking detailed route alignment and design work for the Maynooth to Galway section of the route.  The Royal Canal tow path is the selected route for the section of the facility between Maynooth and Mullingar.  The section from the Meath-Westmealh county boundary to Mullingar is complete and a further section along a disused rail line from Mullingar to Athlone received &euro;4 million funding under the Government's stimulus package in May this year.  The preferred route corridor has been selected from Athlone to Galway.  It is anticipated that this section of the route will pass through Shannonbridge, Loughrea, Craughwell, Clarinbridge and Oranmore and will run along the coast into Galway.  It is proposed to use State-owned lands where feasible; for example, lands owned by Bord na Mona and Coillte.  In terms of the design of the route, the first stage of public consultation has been completed.  While the Minister understands that there has been a negative response from certain landowners along pockets of the route corridor between Galway and Ballinasloe, there is no doubt that Galway County Council will make every effort to evaluate the feedback and refine the route corridor to ensure that all possible alternatives are considered.  <\/p><p>On the general issue of access to land for cycle ways, it is long recognised that using publicly-owned land is advantageous from the perspective of reducing overall capital costs.  The proposed Dublin to Galway greenway is already maximising this option with the development of the route along the Royal Canal from Dublin to Mullingar and then along a disused railway line between Mullingar to Athlone.  The route west from Athlone, however, does not present this level of opportunity for the most part.  As a result, it was necessary to make a decision to use permissive access or CPO to finalise the design of the greenway.  There are valid arguments for both these options and the Minister certainly recognises the value of negotiated permissive access from the perspective of cost and community ownership.  However, for projects of scale like the Galway to Dublin greenway, the process of obtaining permissive access would be administratively cumbersome and resource demanding.  More significantly, it would offer no security of investment from the perspective of the State.  In such a situation, any landowner could withdraw access, as is his or her right, to the greenway at any time, post-construction.  This would be a very precarious situation from the State's perspective and would offer little security in terms of public monies.  Therefore, the Minister thinks it was a prudent decision, in order to maximise the potential of these large scale greenways, to develop such infrastructure using CPO.  While the Minister fully appreciates the anxieties that go hand-in-hand with this approach he does not think the challenges are insurmountable.  <\/p><p>Regarding the Senator's point about an appeals process, the usual CPO mechanisms will apply whereby arbitration is used to finalise pricing.  The Minister further understands that the NRA will be aiming, as much as possible, to route the greenway through the lands of landowners who are willing to co-operate with the scheme.  Ultimately, it will be a matter for all developers of cycling infrastructure to consider access on a case-by-case basis and to take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process of any planned project in order to maximise the potential use of the amenity.  In most cases of smaller greenways and where there are few landowners, the Minister would certainly recommend that all other options be exhausted before land purchase is considered.  However, in the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately-owned land, the Minister does not think it would be realistic to rely on permissive access agreements given that such agreement can be withdrawn at any time without any recourse to the State.  The Minister supports the use of CPO where it is needed but if an alternative approach exists that would give greater security to the State, then he is open to hearing all views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100037#MM00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1418312400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply although I must say it is worrying because there are several major <i>faux pas<\/i>therein.  The Minister of State said that the &quot;preferred route&quot; is mapped out but Victor Cooney, on behalf of the NRA, has said that it is just a &quot;proposed route&quot; and that the authority is open to other options.<br\/>The Minister of State made one point which gives me a little hope.  He said that it is in the State's interests to use public lands where possible and I agree with that.  In that context, I would urge the use of the old N6 road from Athlone to Galway, utilising our beautiful coastline.  If we want tourists to see beauty, we should bring them around by the coast, along the sea front by Maree and Clarinbridge and not have them cutting across farmers' lands.  I mean no disrespect when I say that the reply from the Department suggests that the Minister does not understand rural Ireland and the issues of concern there.  I am probably correct in saying that because we know the Minister is not from rural Ireland.  However, the Minister of State is from rural Ireland and I ask him to convey to the Minister the importance of not implementing CPOs in this case.  We will have another war on our hands if he does so.  We do not need another war to add to the wars over water and everything else.  Let us provide access to rural Ireland in a way that ensures locals will welcome tourists.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100037#MM00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1418312400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport is a very good Minister who understands rural Ireland.  He has family connections in Roscommon through his parents.

That is the preferred way to do it and that is what we hope to do here.  <\/p><p>I will discuss this with officials in the Department because I agree that we need the co-operation and support of farmers.  I hope that the NRA and the county councils can work things out with the farmers.  Where there is an alternative route that does not involve taking someone's land, we will consider it.  The Senator made reference to the preferred route and expressed concerns in that regard.  However, I would point out that the N5 was part of the preferred route but in the end, that was not the route that was selected.  A lot of negotiation took place and another route was found.  There are always preferred routes for projects and we negotiate on that basis.  If we can get agreement, that is fine but if not, we change the route.  I will ask the Minister and departmental officials to make sure, in tandem with Galway County Council, the NRA and the NTA, that they sit down with the farmers who may be affected.  We need the farmers to support us.  In the context of the western greenway, we got the support of the farmers and I thank them for that.  They saw the benefits of the project and got behind it.  Indeed, many new businesses have been set up along the greenway route.  That project would not have happened without the co-operation of the farmers.  I assure the Senator that we will talk to them and try to work everything out.  If we cannot get agreement, we may have to look at other routes and so be it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121100037#MM00400","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1418312400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that reply.
