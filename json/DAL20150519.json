Ireland is a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights system and will liaise regularly with the UK in relation to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers' supervision of states' implementation of court judgments.

As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its principles and institutions.  The fundamental role of human rights in guaranteeing peace and stability in Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted and must at all times be fully respected.  The Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.<\/p>  <p>  We will follow developments closely.

We will work continuously with the British Government and with the power-sharing Executive in Belfast to support the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions and the principles.

The Government remains fully committed to reaching the 0.7% target and to making further progress towards it as our economy continues to recover.  Ireland is a world leader in the proportion of our aid which goes to least developed countries and we strongly support the UN target of providing between 0.15% and 0.2% of GNI for the least developed countries.  Currently, we exceed that target.<\/p>  <p>  Issues of taxation will be central to the financing of sustainable development.  We believe the most effective way to deal with global tax issues is through the OECD.  In an effort to ensure the involvement of the developing world in these processes, the Minister for Finance, at the OECD, has previously called for all countries to undertake spill-over analyses of the impact of their taxation regimes on the developing world, similar to the analysis already commissioned by the Department of Finance in respect of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900009#G00100","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1432043100,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The tax issue is vital to economic justice.

Ireland sits on quite a number of multinational and international fora and, as we have such a good reputation and as our aid is second to none, we can also be a voice when it comes to economic justice.

It is articulated in the recently published document, The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World.  Our policy on international development restates the programme for Government commitment to achieving the United Nation's target of providing 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid once our economic circumstances permit.  Since 2011, the Government has allocated more than &euro;3 billion to overseas development aid.  In 2011, some &euro;657 million was allocated, and between 2012 and 2013 the level of contribution increased from &euro;629 million to &euro;637 million.  The final outturn for 2014 shows Ireland contributed slightly in excess of &euro;610 million to overseas aid.  For 2015, we have again allocated a sum in excess of &euro;600 million to overseas development aid.  We will continue to endeavour to increase this sum until we reach the committed target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900010#H00200","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Other Questions","time":1432043400,"counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900010#H00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432043400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Question No. 13 replied to with Written Answers.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","time":1432043400,"counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900010#H00450"},{"type":"question","time":1432043400,"counter":48,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[19204\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900010#H00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on movements for self-determination in Tibet and among the Uyghur nation of Central Asia.","asker":"1190","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1432043400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The Minister had a very successful visit by the Chinese Prime Minister, Mr. Li Keqiang, and also met his counterpart, the Chinese Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Wang Yi.

Representatives of the International Campaign for Tibet made a presentation at the 28th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva setting out the human rights situation and outlining the growing despair of the Tibetan people.

The Uyghurs are the only population in China consistently subjected to executions for political crimes, and these executions are both summary and public.

The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will be aware of the importance of job creation and the key role the small and medium enterprise sector plays in creating jobs in every county.  Against that background, I was shocked to learn of the experience of an indigenous company that is seeking to create 55 permanent jobs in Carlow as well as 70 construction jobs in the development phase of a new distillery.  I refer to Walsh Whiskey Distillery of Royal Oak, Bagenalstown, County Carlow, which is building the first distillery in the south east for 200 years.<\/p>  <p>  The chief executive of Walsh Whiskey has been working with Carlow County Council since 2012 to facilitate the development of the distillery.  In 2013, the company received a licence from the council to build the facility.  While the company was aware that it would be required, as a business, to pay for water treatment, it was gobsmacked when Irish Water presented it with a bill for &euro;500,000 in addition to the cost of installing a water treatment system.  This unexpected charge is a direct result of the Government's decision to establish Irish Water.  Heretofore, councils always had discretion to assist companies which were prepared to make substantial investments in local communities that badly need jobs.  For example, local councillors, industrialists, engineers and departmental staff would have cut a deal to resolve outstanding difficulties and allow a development to proceed.<\/p><p>The development levies could be charged to future beneficiaries of the infrastructural improvements that would accrue to the area.  Ultimately, as I stated, it would be addressing the deficiency that is obvious, not only in that constituency but throughout this country.  There is a two-tier recovery, that the Minister and the Government is pursuing at pace.  The Minister can be sure under the previous regime and the previous mechanism that were in place a &euro;500,000 bill would not be presented as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>to the company which would make it change its mind and change location.<br\/><br\/>Is Deputy Bruton, as Minister for enterprise, aware of the difficulties that Walsh distillery has in this regard?

A new night caf&eacute;, operated by Merchants Quay, which accommodated 50 homeless a night sleeping on rugs and mats, was opened.

There are rumours amongst those who are homeless that the temporary accommodation, that 260 beds to which I referred, will soon be closed because it was a temporary arrangement until June.  What we are urgently requesting from the Government is a commitment to maintain those beds at a minimum and to increase the emergency accommodation.

Does he accept that the housing crisis is, in fact, creating a homeless crisis in this city and that one of the steps required is for the Government to introduce fair rent controls or at least rent certainty, as promised recently by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, at the Labour Party conference?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900018#Q05600","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1432047000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for raising this question.

The Minister has now put in place a social housing strategy which will develop 35,000 extra social units over the next number of years and he is determined to see a very significant increase in the availability of social housing.

On 5 April 2015, the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, stated in the D&aacute;il that funding of &euro;312 million announced by the Government would provide 1,700 homes by the end of 2017 and would be used for direct builds, meaning not for leasing or buying.  This represents accommodation for fewer than 2% of those on the social housing waiting list.  It suggests that the lion's share of funding will go towards leasing from private landlords and yet the Government's housing policy document warns of the problems arising from the already massive dependence on the private sector for social housing provision, namely, that this reliance is unstable, especially as landlords are seeking higher rents and there are problems identifying new supply.  Michael Taaffe has pointed out that the Government's entire housing strategy is reliant on a long string of fanciful hopes bearing fruit in the right quantity at the right time.  The Government's reliance on non-capital expenditure should be seen as risky at best.  The plan would clearly push the whole area into the hands of the private rental market.  It will put upward pressure on private rents as private tenants compete for units.  The State is adding diesel to the fire.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the Minister that we have a serious housing crisis and the Government is not really dealing with it.  The Government's so-called housing strategy for the next few years does not add up.  The convoluted and contradictory plan announced by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, on several occasions over the past six months does not make sense a lot of the time.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister says the Government is committed to developing sustainable communities but the evidence differs.  Wexford is being given &euro;25 million to build 677 local authority houses, which equates to &euro;37,400 a unit.  Wexford has been told it can build 19 local authority social housing units in the next three years.  I was speaking to a woman who has six children and who is being pushed out of her private rental accommodation.  She is paying the rent but her landlord says he wants to sell the property.  It is obvious that he is not getting enough rent for it even though the woman is adding a top-up payment to the rent supplement.  Why would any landlord take &euro;575 when he can get &euro;700 or &euro;750?  The whole equation is problematic.  There is no sense in the Government's approach and it is too dependent on the private sector behaving in a moral fashion towards those in dire straits.  The Government will need to rethink the strategy.

Contrary to much of the propaganda put around by the Government, when the figures are deconstructed and broken down the live register figures are unchanged.  The standardised unemployment rate is 10%.  The live register basically flat-lined in April with a nominal decline of only 1,800 people, or effectively 0%.  When we factor in the rise in the activation numbers, that is, people who have been placed on labour activation schemes - this figure was 2,000 people in March - the figures will cancel themselves out.<\/p>  <p>  My question to the Taoiseach involved having a look at the types of jobs and where those jobs were.  In January the Taoiseach said that 40,000 new jobs would be created this year and that unemployment would fall below 10% into single figures.  Some 29,000 jobs were created in 2014.  Therefore, we will need far more significant job creation to reach even the levels that the Taoiseach indicated.  Only 14,400 people were taken off the live register in the first four months of this year.  Some 25% of this cohort were put onto labour activation schemes rather than real jobs.  This is becoming a serious source for the Government in glossing over the real unemployment figures.<\/p><p> What types of job are being created?  Official data shows that fewer than half of the jobs added since March are full-time employee positions, which leaves people at a far higher risk of poverty and low pay.  This is reflected in the 70% increase in spending on the family income supplement since 2011.  According to Neary, who investigated payment rates and pay breaches, the risk of low pay is much greater for employees on low hours, in that more than one in two of these are low paid, and the risk is similar for employees with temporary contracts.  This is becoming a recovery based on low pay and low hours.  As of September 2014, the proportion of part-time workers had risen from 19% before the recession to almost a quarter.<\/p> <p> At the end of April, 90,000 people were on labour activation schemes and were not included in the live register.  This means that, in total, there were 439,000 under-employed or unemployed or on labour activation schemes, which is a very high number.  If the figures were being calculated in the US, for example, those people would be included in the figures.  Finfacts refers to this as a broad jobless rate of 20%, and this is the term used in the US.  The emigration rate is, of course, a big safety valve for this Government and, traditionally, for the establishment in this country.  If the emigration rate of the past seven years had stayed at the pre-crisis level, there would be 287,000 more people here in this country, potentially all unemployed.  That would increase the number of unemployed and under-employed people to a massive 726,000, and of the unemployed to over 500,000.  Other countries such as Spain and Italy do not have the same recourse to or tradition of emigration that we, who are living in an English-speaking country, have.  The Government should truly be thankful for the current unemployment rate, given that these people could also be competing for jobs in this economy.  According to the statistics, there are 20 unemployed people competing for every job vacancy, which compares to a figure of five in Belgium and 2.1 in Germany.<\/p> <p> One in ten people who were taken off the live register have now been put on labour activation schemes.  This is a very serious issue which the Government is trying to gloss over; it is a weapon in the armoury of the Government to reduce the unemployment figures.  Moreover, one in four young people are unemployed, and half of those who are unemployed have been in that situation for more than a year, so we have a very high youth unemployment rate.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, reiterated in March that the Government is aiming for sustainable full employment by 2018.  However, that was casually and quietly dropped in the Government's spring economic statement.  Now, full employment has been redefined as an official rate of unemployment of up to 6%, which compares with actual unemployment rates of 4% to 4.6% in 2006-07.  On top of this, the spring statement quietly abandoned the target of full employment, projecting an official jobless rate of 7.8% in 2018 and 6.9% in 2020.  This must be the context for the Minister for Finance's insulting comments about people being allergic to work in this country, which really annoyed and infuriated a lot of people.<\/p> <p> With regard to geography, which Deputies on the other side of the House should be concerned about, employment growth in Dublin and the mid-east is equivalent to 94% of the total net employment growth.  There is a massive geographical imbalance whereby areas outside the Pale are still languishing and stagnating, with the same unemployment figures.  The midlands and mid-west had very moderate increases, while the Border counties are stagnating.  In my own area of Blanchardstown, where there are two Ministers, since December 2014, some 59 people have come off the live register, and, if we go by the national figures, 15 of them will have been put onto labour activation schemes.  It is not a very glowing report in terms of recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900020#S03700","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432048800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy I will give her a full response later today when I get the relevant tables.  She spoke about the breakdown between local authority areas, but the breakdown is done by region, which is a European standard for reporting such information.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to job activation schemes.  There were 89,704 people engaged in activation schemes run by the Department of Social Protection in March 2015.  Those engaged in work-based activation programmes do not fall under the definition of being unemployed and do not appear in the employment estimates as reported by the Quarterly National Household Survey, QNHS, which is the official source of estimated unemployment in the State.  The primary classification used by the QNHS is the ILO labour force classification, which states that those engaged in education-based activation programmes may or may not be classified as unemployed, depending on the labour force situation.  The classification for unemployed persons includes those persons who in the week before the survey were without work, had taken specific steps in the previous four weeks to find work, and were available to take up work in the two weeks after the survey.<\/p>  <p>  In the spring statement, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, outlined that there was strong economic growth of 4.8% of GDP in 2014 and that this should continue to contribute to the growth of the labour market, with employment projected to increase by 40,000 this year.  If the present trends continue, it is highly likely that the unemployment rate will move below 9% by the end of this year.  In quarter 4 of 2014, there were 1,938,900 persons in employment, an increase of 1.5%, or 29,000, on quarter 4 of 2013.  Employment is moving in the right direction.  While Deputy Coppinger wants to put a negative spin on it, these are the figures.  The CSO does not lie, and these are the statistics in its survey.  These are actual net jobs that this Government is creating in a growing economy.  We will continue to do that for as long as we are in government and, I have no doubt, we will do it in the next Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900021#T00200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1432048800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I will try to stay away from the statistics, because we can all get a bit bogged down in them, although there are a number of critical statistics that we need to look at.  I was a bit shocked by what the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation said earlier when he denied that a two-tier recovery is taking place.  It is very strange to hear him come into the House and utter that denial when we know that in the very recent past the Department of Finance made a submission to the Low Pay Commission effectively acknowledging and accepting that, in fact, a two-tier recovery is taking place.<\/p>  <p>  Thanks be to God there is a recovery - we will acknowledge that and we want to see that recovery expanded and consolidated.  I accept the political charge that is made that not every political party would have the same commitment to the achievement of full employment once again.  However, we have to deal with facts.  There is no point in either deluding ourselves or deluding the public about the progress that is being made.<\/p>  <p>  When we talk about a two-tier recovery, we see clearly, as Deputy Coppinger pointed out, what is happening in the Dublin area.  However, while this substantial growth happening in the capital is welcome, it is growth that is not being experienced by the rest of the country.  Even when we look at the growth that is happening in the capital, we have to look at the type of growth that is taking place and we have to ask ourselves what percentage of the new jobs that are being created are part-time jobs or jobs in low-paid employment.<\/p><p>Against that background, we have to consider the dispute in Dunnes Stores.  We have to ask ourselves what sort of country we are living in when the country's leading retailer, for which the people of the country have a lot of regard and respect, employs many people on the type of contract that creates an environment for them in which not alone can they not get a mortgage, but they cannot even enter into a sustainable long-term rental agreement.  <\/p> <p> A number of Members recently held meetings with the group of unions representing Bord na M&oacute;na.  They made it quite clear to us that within that profit-making semi-State company, moves would appear to be under way to change terms and contracts of employment and the rates of pay for people employed by the company.  It is clear that the company has been emboldened by the sort of environment in which we are living, where it seems to be quite possible to drive down wages and disimprove the terms and conditions of employees.  That is something I, for one, would never support.<\/p> <p> Understandably, I spent a lot of time over the past couple of weeks in Carlow-Kilkenny, as I am sure the Minister of State has, and one need only knock on the doors to find out from people that they are in the second tier and have yet to feel there is any real sense of recovery, additional cash in their pockets or jobs of which they or their family members can avail.  Last evening, we met community groups and representatives of business interests with our candidate, Bobby Aylward.  One of the issues raised was the lack of IDA Ireland visits to Carlow-Kilkenny.  The record of IDA Ireland in terms of visits to the constituency is rather poor.  <\/p> <p> I read the statistics on my county, Kildare, and noted that in each of the past three years there has been only one IDA Ireland visit.  I find that quite shocking.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900021#T00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432049400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>What about the Kerry Group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900022#U00200","speaker":"975"},{"type":"speech","time":1432049400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The Kerry Group is very welcome and will be a great employer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900022#U00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1432049400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>How many jobs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900022#U00400","speaker":"975"},{"type":"speech","time":1432049400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I am not quite sure.  Maybe Deputy Carey can tell me.  The Kerry Group is welcome, as were Hewlett-Packard and Intel before it.  We cannot stay static, however.  County Kildare is growing rapidly and is one of the fastest-growing counties in the country.  As a result of the growth in population, we must see a corresponding growth in jobs.  The Minister of State alluded to some statistics.  Those on job creation and job losses in County Kildare were interesting.  The statistics on IDA Ireland-supported companies show - Deputy Carey is correct - that 1,522 jobs were created in the course of 2012, 2013 and 2014, which is very good.  However, in the corresponding period, 1,526 jobs were lost in IDA Ireland-sponsored companies.  As far as IDA Ireland is concerned, we in County Kildare have been left with a net loss.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, appears in mass media every day to tell us about all the jobs that are being created.  We cannot see those jobs; they are not tangible.  The points made by Deputy Coppinger are very relevant and correct.  Between 86,000 and 90,000 people are in various job activation schemes.  It is good that those people are being activated, but let us not fool ourselves about the fact that they are in need of full-time employment.  An additional 124,000 are in part-time employment, but aspire to achieve full-time employment.  The ambition of some 250,000 people is to achieve full-time employment and they do not fall into the category to which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, alluded to in the past week or so.  Such people want to go to work, as do the majority of people who are unemployed.  <\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister of State tell us what will be done to ensure that those in activation schemes can progress from them to more meaningful employment?  What will be done by the Government to address the plight of those people in part-time employment who want to work full-time?  What will be done to ensure that State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland reach out and become far more active in encouraging employers to locate in the regions where their activity is badly needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900022#U00500","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1432049400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>The Minister of State quoted from some of the tables with which he will supply us later, namely, the quarterly national household figures.  I presume the Minister referred to the last published figures from February which relate to last year.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand 26,900 net new jobs were created last year.  When one examines the figures and the details, as others have, such as Deputy Coppinger who mentioned them earlier, one can see that the Government's recent commitment to deliver full employment by 2018 would be quite difficult.  The difference between those who were made unemployed and the jobs that were created was 26,900.  The Government said it needed to create full employment by 2018.  To do that it would need to double that figure each year between now and 2018.  That goal has eluded the Government for four years, as have other goals mentioned by Deputies.  I do not see any strategy which is capable of doubling the delivery of net jobs to the State each year for the next four years.  Some 50,000 net jobs per year would need to be created to achieve the Government's goal.  It is also my goal, but it has been set by the Government which wants to deliver it by 2018.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have the tables to which the Minister of State referred.  Therefore, we do not know whether the CSO reflects the fact that for every new job created, five people have migrated from our shores to America, Australia and elsewhere.  I do not know whether the table on emigration supplied by the CSO is among the tables the Minister of State has put together and said he will circulate.  <\/p>  <p>  Does he accept the figures show that the number of people in employment in the west had fallen by 4,800 and in the south west by 5,000 up to December 2014?  The numbers in employment in the Border region, as Deputy Coppinger mentioned, have fallen by 1,300 since the Government took office.<\/p><p>That suggests that whenever the Government issues these tables, the figures for those who have emigrated should also be attached.<\/p> <p> There was no increase in employment in the Border area, despite Enterprise Ireland and the IDA saying that 2014 was a successful year.  For those living in rural Ireland it does not seem to have been successful.  I have cited three different regions - the west, the south west and the Border region - as having fewer people employed than when the Government took office.<\/p> <p> Unlike the Government, the IDA has failed to meet its targets on regional job creation.  This is in part due to a lack of investment in infrastructure and a lack of political will.  The Minister of State is obviously not responsible for that.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation can come before the House and respond on the IDA and Enterprise Ireland as well as the local enterprise offices, which are not properly funded or resourced.  Unless the Minister, Deputy Bruton, remedies that, the CSO figures for which the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, is responsible will show a further decline in employment.<\/p> <p> This situation is not captured in the figures that have been presented to date.  How many of those jobs are part time or low paid?  That is a key factor in terms of the jobs being created in future.  We have seen a further decline in 2014 in the number of young people aged between 20 and 34 in the labour force.  That might be a reflection of the nearly 90,000 the Minister of State has said are in job activation.<\/p> <p> There needs to be a greater focus on city and town marketing plans that provide e-commerce platforms for local businesses, although, again, this is not the Minister of State's responsibility.  He needs to be saying that these CSO figures are reflecting unemployment, under-employment and employment decline not only in rural Ireland but also in towns and cities.  The Minister of State can reflect that at the Cabinet table.<\/p> <p> Does the Minister of State accept that the Labour Party and Fine Gael continued to fail Ireland's missing generation, with 60,000 fewer 20 to 34 year-olds in employment since they took office?  That is a huge figure which I talked about earlier in respect of emigration.  The number of new graduates leaving is even higher.  It would be interesting to see if the CSO figures are reflecting the number of graduates in employment.  We are training up a whole new generation of graduates, yet the State is not likely to see the benefit of its investment in their education.  Other countries such as Australia, England, America and maybe even countries in Europe will see the benefit of that investment instead.  The most recent data from the Higher Education Authority tells us that the number of Irish graduates working abroad has increased, and that 12% of the 2013 graduates were working overseas compared to 5% in 2008.  Although I doubt it, those statistics may be contained in the CSO figures that are going to be released later.<\/p> <p> Does the Minister of State accept that unemployment has fallen?  We accept that.  However, the number of those in jobs activation, which other Deputies have mentioned, has not been added to that figure of roughly 89,400 that the Minister of State mentioned himself.  People in jobs activation schemes are classified as employed.  We would have a different and substantially higher unemployment rate if those numbers were added together along with the under-employed, those in part-time work who would like to be full-time employed and those on temporary contracts who would like to be on full-time contracts.  This opens up the Government to the accusation that the figures are massaged.  That is a charge the Minister of State needs to answer in respect of the way the CSO figures are contained.  We will go onto another question afterwards about crime figures; there is a controversy around how the question is put and the statistics gathered.  It is the same in this case?<\/p> <p> In other countries, those on job activation schemes are recorded as unemployed.  Those not in full-time employment are also accounted for so that there is a real unemployment figure rather than a fake one.  Many job activation schemes have not led to jobs or full-time employment, as has been discussed in this House.  There is a major question about how to use statistics and whether the statistics reflect reality.<\/p> <p> The number of those in part-time work continues to increase and is now 13% higher than in 2007.  People who are unemployed would be happy with whatever work they can get, yet the Minister of State should accept there is a danger that the statistics will be reflecting an increase in part-time work.  Although increased employment is welcome, we need to look at the quality of those jobs.  The figures I have seen to date do not indicate whether the increases are in high-end jobs, whether the new jobs pay or make work pay.  Nor do they indicate how many of those in full-time employment are in fact also in receipt of the likes of family income supplement, FIS.  It is necessary to ensure that it is worth people's while to present for full-time work or at least for the minimum 19 hours that would qualify for FIS.  There are people who want full-time work and those who are happy with 19 hours.  That is for them to decide.<\/p> <p> When are the next quarterly national household figures due?  Has the Minister of State any indication as to whether they will be substantially different from the ones presented to the public in February this year?  What is he going to do?  What are the changes in terms of the west, the Border and the south west in particular?  They were the main focus of the downturn in employment numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900022#U00600","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432050000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Let me confirm to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that quarterly national household survey data for quarter one of 2015 is due for publication by the CSO this Thursday, 21 May at 11 a.m.  I am not aware of the figures as of yet nor does the Government get the figures before the CSO releases them.<\/p>  <p>  Both Deputies asked similar questions.  Two-tier recovery was mentioned.  I would not call it a two-tier recovery but there is no doubt that the large mass of population in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway means those places are going to recover faster, specifically in the city areas - I think the Deputy would recognise that.  It is going to take a little bit longer to go down into the rural parts of the country.   Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke about the south east, particularly County Carlow.  As he mentioned his candidate I will mention mine - David Fitzgerald has outlined his plans for Carlow-Kilkenny over the last weeks.  In the south east in general there were 40,000 jobs lost between 2008 and 2010.<\/p><p>In the past two years 23,000 jobs have been created.<\/p> <p> Regional imbalance is a concern and a priority for the Government.  This is why the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has specific target areas for the various regions in the Action Plan for Jobs.  He spoke about this on Leaders' Questions.  Recently he brought together all of the agencies under the Action Plan for Jobs to get the regions up and going.  The Minister changed the structure of the local employment offices, LEOs, and they are now more interactive with regard to what is happening in each county than they may have been in the past.  The 2014 annual results for the LEOs published by the Minister show that 4,012 extra jobs were created by companies supported by the Department through the LEOs.  At the end of 2014, total direct employment among the 6,058 client companies stood at 31,326 jobs.  A total of 7,305 new jobs were created during 2014 in gross terms.  Taking into account losses, the net increase in the number of people at work in these companies was 14%.  Jobs growth happened in every county during 2014 in companies supported by LEOs.<\/p> <p> In recent months, Combilift created an extra 200 jobs in Monaghan with a &euro;40 million investment.  In Tipperary, Ribworld created 100 jobs.  In Leitrim, VistaMed created 125 jobs.  In Longford, C &amp;amp; D Foods created 70 jobs.  In Athlone, Alexon created 200 jobs.  In Waterford, West Pharmaceutical created 150 jobs.  Bausch and Lomb made a recent announcement there also.  In Wexford, 200 jobs were created by ClearStream, and TalkTalk made a jobs announcement in recent years.<\/p> <p> We would love to be able to say 300 or 400 jobs are being created throughout the country, but we must create the economy and the basis for enticing companies and foreign direct investment to come to Ireland.  There was a total collapse of the construction industry in 2008 and 2009 and it is still recovering.  In fairness, the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, have made significant investment in local authority housing, and there have been many school extensions and new schools.  St. Aidan's in Enniscorthy has had an investment of &euro;7.5 million, and a &euro;4.5 million investment has been made in St. Senan's national school.  The CBS in Enniscorthy and the national school in Bree have had significant investments, as have other schools throughout the county.  This investment increases employment in the construction industry, but we cannot depend on this industry as we did in the past.  We must look at other methods of employment.<\/p> <p> Under the Action Plan for Jobs, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is acutely aware of an imbalance, but I do not want to call it a two-tier recovery.  Every county in the country has seen an improvement in the tourism industry because of the reduction in the VAT rate put in place by the Government to entice tourists from across the water to come to Ireland and create extra employment, and this has happened.  I am concerned about the fact that hotels throughout the greater Dublin area have increased their prices significantly in recent months.  Hotels went through a very lean period during the recession, but I would not like to see them out-pricing themselves, because it will turn people away from coming to Ireland for holiday or seeing it as a cheap destination.  It is all about employment and having deals for people to come to Ireland.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh spoke about migration and emigration .  We all know of people who emigrated between 2008 and 2012, specifically young, well-educated people.  We call it the brain drain of Ireland.  Many of these people are returning.  I cannot say all of them will coming back, as some of them have set up homes and families in the US, Australia, Canada or elsewhere.  We must create the economic climate for them to return.  Creating the economic climate to establish new jobs and encourage direct investment is the most important thing we must do.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also spoke about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  I did not realise the work that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland carry out until I became a Minister of State, because I now have a direct relationship with them.  On trips abroad, specifically for St. Patrick's Day, representatives of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland travel with Government representatives.  We also have diplomats who represent Ireland abroad.  They do an absolutely fantastic job.  I did not realise the work they do until I went abroad and saw it at first hand.<\/p> <p> I would love to see IDA Ireland bring more foreign direct investment companies or potential clients to County Wexford, but there must be an attractiveness there for companies.  My understanding is that when a foreign direct investment company approaches IDA Ireland, it must go through a checklist as to whether Wexford or Kildare has facilities A, B, C, D and E.  A county might not have A but they might have B.  It is about putting the perfect fit together.  One company was very interested in locating in the south east, as the Rosslare Europort is there, but the reason it hesitated about coming to Wexford was the road network.  The Enniscorthy and New Ross bypasses will open up County Wexford and create an extra incentive for a foreign direct investment company to go to Wexford and create jobs.  I have no doubt this is the same throughout the country.<\/p> <p> I do not want us to leave the House saying there is a two-tier recovery in Ireland.  Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway are recovering a touch faster, but we must create the environment for the rest of the country.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is acutely aware of this, which is why he has established regional projects in the Action Plan for Jobs, which was a brilliant initiative in early 2012.  Every Department is involved in it.  It breaks down the barriers to creating employment in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900023#V00200","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","time":1432051200,"counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900025#X00100"},{"type":"question","time":1432051200,"counter":222,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[13368\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900025#X00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the reason the Central Statistics Office's data on recorded crime for quarter 3 of 2014 have not yet been published; and when they will be published.

As a member of Dublin City Council's joint policing committee, I recall being presented with reports in which there was clearly a difference in how crime statistics were compiled for different districts, even where districts were only two or three miles apart.  It was only when one amalgamated the figures for two or three subcategories of crime that one would arrive the true figure for a particular crime.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital, at the very least, that everybody involved in gathering statistics in regard to crime use the same terminology.  In particular, there should be a clearly understood rationale for referring to a crime under a different title and an explanation as to why some crimes are recorded under a different category.  In the case of theft, for instance, a number of categories might be used, including theft from a vehicle, theft from a house, larceny, theft from a shop, and so on.  During my time on the joint policing committee, we sometimes had to ask the superintendent presenting the report to give an explanation of the differences between crimes and the reason for their categorisation in the statistics.  In addition, we often queried instances in which crimes were recorded as supposedly being solved.  The problem was that \"solved\" did not necessarily mean there was a conviction at the end of it.  It might mean, for example, that the garda&iacute; involved in the investigation had managed to identify a suspect.  There was not necessarily a delivery for the victim of the crime.<\/p>  <p>  There probably is a need to have different subcategories for particular crimes, but the overall theft figure, for example, should also be provided.  This is not just important for those of us who look at these statistics and ask about them in this Chamber.  It is important because it influences how the Garda authorities allocate scarce resources.  They must be able to respond quickly where they see a crime surge happening in a three-month or six-month period, for instance, by ensuring that adequate manpower and resources, including vehicles, investment in buildings and so on, are directed towards areas of highest crime.  That can only be done effectively if the statistics stand up, and, as I understand it, it was because there were doubts in this regard that the CSO suspended the provision of the information.  It is to be hoped that when the data are finally released, we can be confident that they stand up.  They should, in addition, be presented under the same categories as those used for the Garda national crime figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900025#X00500","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1432051200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I join the Deputies in welcoming the resumed publication of the CSO quarterly recorded crime statistics in late June.  I accept that the suspension of the provision of this information has been a concern for Members, including Deputies opposite, several of whom have raised it on more than one occasion in the House in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of 2012, the Garda Inspectorate conducted a major review of how crime is investigated in Ireland.  This led to the publication of a report in November 2014 which examined issues such as training resource management, treatment of persons in custody and many other areas which are not of relevance to crime statistics.  The main focus of the report was on cases of assault, burglary, domestic violence and robbery reported between 2011 and 2012.  As part of its analysis, the inspectorate examined 1,500 crime records on the PULSE system, spoke to 1,000 garda&iacute;, examined 158 calls for service received in the 12 months up to mid-2012, visited external stakeholders and other police services, sampled computer-aided dispatch and paper records, collected data on staffing and employment levels, and visited stations and control rooms in various Garda divisions to observe operations.<\/p>  <p>  Of particular interest in respect of the CSO was the inspectorate review of how crime is reported and recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Specifically, the report raised several concerns in regard to the accuracy of recorded crime and other administrative data, including the non-recording of crimes on PULSE.  In fact, the inspectorate estimated that more than 30% of offences reported were not being recorded on PULSE.  It identified evidence of a lack of timely recording of incidents, lack of sufficient detail on PULSE narratives, misclassification of incidents, including to non-crime categories, incorrect reclassification of incidents - again, including to and from non-crime categories - incorrect application of detention status to some incidents, and shortening and alteration of narrative feeds to justify subsequent decisions on detention status.<\/p>  <p>  While the issues raised in the report relate primarily to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they also have implications for the crime statistics produced by the CSO.  In its response to the findings of the Garda Inspectorate, the CSO said it viewed with concern any issues which could have an impact on its official quarterly statistics.  The crime data published by the CSO, the office noted, depend entirely on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's systems and procedures in respect of recorded crime.  In November 2014, the director general of the CSO contacted the Garda Commissioner with a view to examining the statistical implications of the inspectorate report.  The CSO then commenced work assessing the statistical issues arising.  This involved a detailed analysis of both the PULSE system and other Garda administrative data sets by CSO crime section personnel.<\/p><p>This work, which is an important step in ensuring the quality and coverage of crime statistics, delayed the current schedule of publication of the crime statistics by the CSO.  The CSO will publish a more detailed response by the end of June 2015, identifying the extent of the impact on statistics in respect of coverage and classification from the issues highlighted in the Garda Inspectorate report.  As a precaution, until the conclusion of the CSO review process, the CSO suspended the release of any new statistical information and publications that incorporate PULSE-administered data.  The publication of the quarterly record of crime reports of quarter three and quarter four of 2014 and the Garda crime statistics 2009-2013 have been delayed as a direct result of this review process.  The CSO will resume publication of quarterly reports in late 2015.<\/p> <p> The Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation forms an important component of the overall justice reform programme, which is currently under way and in respect of which significant progress has already been made.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established an implementation steering group to focus on the implementation of short, medium and long-term recommendations in the report and to assist in the overall reform process a strategic transformation office has been established at Garda headquarters to co-ordinate the implementation of reforms arising from the report.  As part of this process, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is reviewing all aspects of how crime is being recorded and classified as a result of the recommendations made in the inspectorate's report.  A new instant recording process, which addresses the challenges identified in the report, has been developed and is currently being piloted in three Garda divisions.  The pilot is focused on achieving data integrity for both crime and non-crime incidents reported to the Garda information services.  That is a comprehensive reply for the Deputies opposite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900025#X00600","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432051800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1432051800,"counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900026#Y00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1432051800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Private Members&rsquo; business which shall be No. 65 &ndash; Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) Bill 2014 &ndash; Second Stage, shall be taken on the conclusion of Topical Issues and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after three hours.

This issue is the funding of local radio.  Over the course of the last 20 years no other medium in this country has expanded as rapidly to the four corners of the island as local radio.<\/p>  <p>  There are 34 or 35 local radio stations operating in the Republic of Ireland at present but their access to funding from the State is very limited, to say the least.  The Sound &amp;amp; Vision scheme, which is funded from the licence fee, is approximately 7% of the total licence fee take.  In that scheme very strict guidelines are imposed on the local media providers in terms of how that funding can be drawn down.  These businesses have not been immune to the downturn in the economy over the last few years and many of them have experienced significant cutbacks in terms of their employment.  They employ hundreds of people across the country.  They have lobbied and been anxious for a period of time that the Government would honour its commitment in the programme for Government to undertake a review of the funding of broadcasting to ensure a viable sector for both independent and State-owned broadcasters.<\/p>  <p>  The current provision under the Sound &amp;amp; Vision scheme is limited very much to programmes that can be provided primarily in the areas of history, culture and the Irish language.  Indeed, most of the funding from that scheme is granted to the existing State-owned media outlets and a very small proportion of it ends up being utilised on local media outlets.  In many parts of the country, not least in my own, local radio is by far the most listened to and most used form of media on a daily basis, and there is a need for the Government and the Minister to ensure that the sector remains viable into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will have some positive news in that regard.  I will take the opportunity afterwards to respond to his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900028#AA01300","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1432053000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Government policy is to encourage and support a diverse media that serves all of the people.  Licence fee funding for public service broadcasting provides an independent and reliable income, which allows the two public service broadcasters - RTE and TG4 - to meet their public service objectives with a high level of editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.  Under the dual funding model, RTE is statutorily obliged to use its commercial revenues to further subsidise its public service obligations.<\/p>  <p>  All public, community and independent commercial broadcasters can access public funding from the broadcasting funding scheme, mentioned by the Deputy, which encourages programming on Irish culture, heritage, adult literacy and global issues.  Funded by 7% of net television licence fee receipts, Sound &amp;amp; Vision II funded 477 projects, worth over &euro;3.6 million, from commercial radio stations.  This represented 40% of the total radio allocation.  By contrast, allocations to public service broadcasting stations from the fund in the same period were worth less than &euro;1 .6 million or 18% of the total.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise the contribution that the commercial sector makes to broadcasting in Ireland, but I remain to be convinced that the further distribution of public funds to independent commercial broadcasters, beyond the supports that already exist, would represent good public or broadcasting policy.  The net effect of such a move would be to reduce the amount of funding available to all other broadcasters, community and public, and I see little logic in this proposition in the current circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I recently published an economic analysis of the Irish advertising market, which was undertaken by Indecon as part of the Government's response to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's five year review of the funding of public service broadcasting.  It is now my intention to put forward a number of proposals for amending the current regulatory framework for advertising.  In regard to commercial radio advertising, I am proposing to give the BAI oversight and control of the amount of advertising minutage allowed to such broadcasters.  I expect that this will provide more flexibility than in the current situation, where the amount of permitted minutage is effectively set in stone.  I will also put forward amendments to ensure that the BAI's reviews of public service broadcasting funding will always take account of the impact of its recommendations on the broader advertising market.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these proposed changes will lead to a more sustainable advertising regulatory framework for all broadcasters which, in the context of an improving economy, should assist in delivering a viable future for everyone in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900028#AA01400","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1432053000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I cannot say that I am entirely satisfied with the Minister's response.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to review the system, and the Minister has outlined some of the changes he proposes to make.  However, it has been brought to my attention with regard to the Sound &amp;amp; Vision fund, which is the 7% figure I mentioned earlier, that the funding for individual television projects tends to be in the range of over &euro;100,000, whereas funding for radio projects tends to be in the &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000 category.  The reality is that for many communities, individuals and families in this country, their local radio station is their supplier of news and current affairs information.<\/p><p>While I understand the limitations of the existing system, I feel the current provision is not adequately reflective of where people actually get their news and current affairs content from.  The Minister has outlined some changes in relation to advertising, which are to be welcomed.  The recent economic downturn has had a significant effect on local radio providers around the country.  Changes in that regard may have an impact into the future, but there is a crunch or pinch situation that exists at present.  I suggest that in terms of what the licence fee aims to provide, the allocation received by local independent radio stations, or for which they are eligible to apply, is not reflective of the content produced by such stations on a daily basis.  I will probably return to this matter again.

For that reason, a legislative amendment would be required if we were to go down the road being suggested, or at least being suggested for discussion, by the Deputy.  I have to say I have some sympathy with the point he has made about radio.  As a former radio producer, I fully appreciate the importance of radio, particularly local radio, in the area of news and current affairs and in the area of programming generally.  Radio makes a critically important contribution to social and community life in urban and rural areas across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Given that one can achieve so much more bang for one's buck with radio programming, it is sometimes frustrating for people who work in radio to see the huge amounts of money that seem to be spent in the public and private sectors on the production of television programming.  That is the point I would make, with the indulgence of the Chair, about the public and private approaches to what radio can do and can achieve.  The consideration by any Government of a transfer of public funding to private commercial operators would not be not without controversy and should therefore be given serious consideration by the Oireachtas.  At the very minimum, a considerable debate about the circumstances in which we might want to take the licence fee and distribute it across the board to commercial operators would have to take place in this House.  We would need to have regard to the likely impact that would have on public service broadcasters and public service broadcasting.  It is natural that the withdrawal of resources from public service broadcasting will have an impact.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the issues raised by the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland and the various radio stations around the country, many of which have suffered greatly as a result of the impact of the recession.  I want to see this sector thriving.  It is very much part of my thinking to ensure it grows and thrives, but not at the expense of the public sector.  We should be able to configure our funding arrangements and our regulatory system, in relation to advertising minutage and so on, in a way that ensures we do not seek to improve one sector by taking resources away from another sector.  I will be quite happy to return to this issue with the Deputy and with others in this House.  I reiterate that it is extremely important for us to support broadcasting generally and ensure both the public and private sectors can survive and thrive into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900029#BB00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Establishment","time":1432053600,"counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900029#BB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1432053600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting this important issue, which focuses on the urgent need to secure approval for a new secondary school in Kinnegad, to be addressed on the floor of the D&aacute;il this evening.  It is important that this matter reaches the D&aacute;il, as it has done in the past by means of the parliamentary questions I have been persistent in raising.<\/p><p>My colleague, Mr. Denis Leonard, who is a former member of Westmeath County Council, remains a tremendously dedicated community activist despite his defeat in the local elections last May.  His loss from electoral politics has been severely felt.  He has been and remains at the vanguard of a campaign to establish a new secondary school in Kinnegad, which is now the third largest town in County Westmeath with a population of approximately 3,000 and the demographics associated with an expanding population.  It has experienced a rapid increase in population and continues to grow from a demographic perspective.  This augments the case and makes a persuasive argument for a new school.  Mr. Leonard, who was a councillor at the time, was not behind the door in June 2011 when he let us all know in no uncertain fashion that he was greatly disappointed and annoyed by the failure to include Kinnegad in that month's announcement of 40 new school projects to be completed by the end of 2017 as part of the public capital schools programme.<\/p><p>This failure was particularly disappointing in the context of the N4-M4 study, which was conducted by the Department in 2004.  The 2004 report advised that a site should be specifically reserved for the development of a secondary school in Kinnegad to cater for a projected enrolment of more than 700 students in the long term.  Indeed, it referred specifically to post-2011 needs; in other words, the requirements we have now.  As I have said, the population of Kinnegad has doubled since then.  It is now the third largest town in County Westmeath and its population is still increasing.<\/p><p>Approximately 560 pupils are attending the excellent St. Etchen's primary school in Kinnegad.  Significant numbers of new students are starting there in September.  There are five primary schools, with an average of approximately 100 pupils per school, within six miles of the town.  Children in the general Kinnegad area attend approximately nine different secondary schools, some of which are approaching maximum numbers because their own immediate catchment areas are population growth centres as well.  Many of these schools are also stretched from an accommodation perspective.<\/p><p>Unlike some people who have shown a belated interest in the need for a secondary school in Kinnegad, I have not come to this topic recently.  As long ago as 2006, I tabled a parliamentary question to the then Minister for Education and Science, Mary Hanafin, calling for a school to be put in place in Kinnegad by 2011 on the basis of the then population projections for the Kinnegad area.  In response, the then Minister said:<blockquote>The local area development plan for the N4\/M4 corridor outlines my Department's long-term educational strategy at both primary and post-primary level for the area concerned.  The recommendations in the plan are being considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme from 2006 onwards subject to the prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.<\/blockquote>When I contacted the then area manager of Westmeath County Council - the late great George Lambden - to seek a response from the council to the need for a site to be acquired for a secondary school in Kinnegad, he indicated that the council would be willing to meet officials from the then Department of Education and Science to discuss the matter and said that a site could be identified if the Department were prepared to purchase it.  In 2006, the then vocational education committee confirmed that the subject of a secondary school for Kinnegad had come up for discussion with the Minister of State's Department when future educational infrastructure developments were being reviewed.<\/p><p>Things have progressed positively at local level since then.  I am aware that approximately 17 acres of suitable land are now available at a very reasonable price.  A smaller acreage can be bought if that is what is required.  More importantly, this specific land is zoned as &quot;educational&quot; in the county development plan and an access road has been constructed adjacent to the local primary school.  It is perfectly located from a strategic perspective, in terms of the clustering of educational infrastructure.  It is clear that the closer to each other the primary and secondary schools are, the more they will complement each other.<\/p><p>I do not need to over-elaborate as I spell out how important and vital a secondary school would be to the future development of the Kinnegad area and its large geographical hinterland.  It would allow young people to attend secondary school in their own localities.  As a consequence, it would give them a greater sense of local community.  It would allow them to have opportunities to contribute to the community as young citizens through school programmes.  It would ensure young students, who are at the heart of the community, do not have to leave the local area every day to secure their secondary education.  It would minimise the strain on the school transport system and lead to savings for parents who currently have to pay for school transport.  This is another issue that is often referred to locally, as school transport costs represent a significant drain on the hard-pressed budgets of parents.<\/p><p>On behalf of the citizens and the community of Kinnegad, I request that the commitment given to the provision of a secondary school in Kinnegad be honoured.  That is no more and no less than what the people of the area deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900029#BB00400","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1432053600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to remind the House of the significant challenges we face in meeting increasing demand for pupil places throughout the country in the coming years and to explain how this will be addressed.<\/p><p>We remain in an era of significant growth in the school going cohort at both primary and post-primary level.<\/p> <p> At post-primary level, it is projected that almost 33,000 extra places will be needed between 2013 and 2020.  Post-primary enrolment is set to continue to rise until 2025 at least with some 71,698 extra places being needed between 2013 and that time.  Up to 2020, this increase in pupil numbers at post-primary level is the equivalent of up to 33 new 1,000 pupil post-primary schools.<\/p> <p> The Deputy probably knows the Department uses a geographical information system, GIS, to identify where the pressure for school places will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, and the Department of Social Protection in addition to the Department's databases.  It also uses data from local authorities.<\/p> <p> With this information, the Department is in the process of carrying out a nationwide demographic analysis to determine where additional post-primary accommodation may be needed from 2017 onwards.  This is a significant exercise and is continuing.  When the exercise has been completed arrangements will be made to make additional accommodation available where it is needed.  However, the needs of the Kinnegad area are included in this nationwide demographic review.<\/p> <p> In June 2011, the Minister announced the need for the establishment of some 20 new post-primary schools to cater for increased demographics across a number of locations up to 2017.  This announcement did not include a proposal to establish a new post-primary school in Kinnegad, as the demographics of the area did not support the need for a new second level school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900029#BB00500","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432054200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.  The Minister for Education and Skills should consider the M4 study, which indicated that between 2011 and 2017 the demographic need was pressing.  One can always get a set of criteria to suit whatever outcome one wants to achieve.  There are very few primary schools outside a major urban centre with 560 pupils.  In the satellite areas for 5 miles around it, there are five primary schools, each with 100 pupils.  Kinnegad is on the eastern side of Westmeath, the envelope of Westmeath and is a beautiful town.  A secondary school in Kinnegad would also facilitate students from just across the county boundary in Meath.  The demographics are extremely positive.  A huge influx of people came into the area in the early 2000s up to 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The county development plan provided for that influx.  It also provided for the designation of an area consistent with the M4 study to be zoned for education.  The land is there.  The Minister will never again have the opportunity to get this land.  It is very reasonable.  Nobody is trying to gazump anybody else.  It is available at a fixed price and is adjacent to the primary school, a complementary location.  It will be very disappointing if an opportunity like this is not taken.<\/p>  <p>  There is a population of approximately 3,000 in Kinnegad with a significant cohort of young people.  This increases to 5,000 when the hinterland is included.  St. Etchen's is one of the largest rural primary schools, accommodating 560 pupils.  There is a strong and compelling case to make sure Kinnegad is not bypassed on this occasion and gets the secondary school it deserves.  It is important for the third largest town, which is expanding, in Westmeath.  The people there are willing to put their shoulders to the wheel to make sure this becomes a reality.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Department of Education and Skills to stop its usual foot-dragging tactics.  It always allows the egg to be cracked and then tries to unscramble it.  It has the opportunity to buy land at a very reasonable price that is designated for educational infrastructure.  Now is the time.  Studies are only exercises in procrastination, obfuscation and delay.  There is no need for any more studies of demographics.  The Department can check with Matt Melvin and the other teachers there, who will tell it about the study.  I do not want any more foot-dragging on this.  It is time that it was brought, and driven, forward.  I ask the Minister of State to relay that to the Minister for Education and Skills.  I will certainly take every opportunity of doing so to ensure that the voice of the people of Kinnegad, who deserve a secondary school, is heard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900030#CC00200","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1432054200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I take on board what the Deputy has said.

Last week it was reported that &euro;50 million, required by Dublin City Council to deal with the homeless crisis, had not been paid or allocated to the council by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I spoke to council officials this week and there has been no progress on this.  The &euro;50 million in question is &euro;42 million for homeless services and &euro;8 million to refurbish council homes which are vacant.  This comes against the backdrop of unprecedented numbers of people becoming homeless, huge demand for emergency accommodation and social housing and a shortage of private rental properties.<\/p>  <p>  Forty new families become homeless a month, mostly due to soaring rent levels which are completely unregulated.  There are 1,000 children in emergency accommodation, 150 or so people sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin and over 20,000 unable to find affordable and suitable housing.  In regard to housing the only place there is no shortage is the press office of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Every week it seems there is an announcement of money already announced with more details but somehow less actual information.  This strategy is to confuse the public and give the media pre-written column inches without any substance in the hope it will not look deeper.  It does not need too deep a look as the Government's plan is very shallow indeed.  Despite false claims of billions being spent on housing, this is a six year plan for a Government with only approximately six months to live.<\/p>  <p>  What is behind the headline?  This Government plans to build just 167 homes in the next two and a half years in this city.  This is creative accounting masking callous inactivity.  The real figures show less than a third of planned funding for this and the following two years will actually go to real social housing.  The rest is a transfer of funding from rent supplement to the slightly different housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  This Government is doing less and less to provide housing.  We need commitments and action on real change; a commitment to increase emergency bed capacity; to maintain 50% housing allocation for the homeless in Dublin; to create a one-stop shop in local authorities for homeless and at risk tenants; to introduce a fair rent system of regulation to end the flow of tenants into homelessness; to invest in building thousands more social houses every year; and to admit that we face a national emergency due to our housing shortage and that serious, strong and even drastic measures are needed to ensure the public good is served and the right to housing protected.

A total of &euro;64 million has been allocated in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency for the housing strategy.  In all my years of living in Carlow-Kilkenny I have not heard of such an allocation being made by previous Administrations.<\/p><p> On 1 April last, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities to meet the delivery targets set out in the social housing strategy for the years until 2017.  This funding will be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes by local authorities and will result in a 25% reduction nationally on housing waiting lists.<\/p> <p> The targets are ambitious and must be backed up with resources - hence the importance of the provisional funding allocations that were also announced.  The allocation of &euro;1.5 billion is a significant commitment by the Government to support delivery of social housing by local authorities and others.  The Government followed up the setting of three-year targets by approving, on 5 May last, the largest social housing construction endeavour for many years.  This &euro;312 million investment covers all 31 local authorities and will result in 1,700 housing units being built across approximately 100 separate projects.  The announcement, the first of its kind under the social housing strategy, will be followed by further announcements.<\/p> <p> Headline allocations have been made in respect of social housing targets for all local authorities until 2017.  In addition, allocations to local authorities in respect of a number of specific areas of housing activity have been made or are being finalised.  The Minister has made an additional &euro;10.5 million available nationally for homeless accommodation and related services in 2015.  This increase in funding of more than 20% brings the Exchequer contribution this year to &euro;55.5 million.  The 2015 regional allocations are being finalised and will be confirmed shortly.<\/p> <p> The Department has secured increases in funding in important areas such as disability grants and supports for older people.  These apply both to local authority tenants and the support local authorities provide to private home owners to make adaptations which enable older people or persons with a disability to remain in their homes.  Further allocations in respect of energy efficiency upgrades for local authority housing will be made shortly, bringing benefits to householders through reduced fuel bills.<\/p> <p> On the issue of tackling vacant social housing units, I want local authorities to continue to effectively address this challenge.  The Department continues to provide Exchequer support for this work and will soon announce a new round of targets and funding.  The social housing strategy makes clear, however, that this funding will be linked to local authorities having in place ongoing maintenance programmes to address the issue of vacant properties.  Local authorities need to make social houses available to new tenants as quickly as possible.  Given the rental income available to them, they should be able to quickly find new tenants for the majority of units that become vacant.<\/p> <p> I am confident that all these measures, for which the Government is providing increased resources, are tackling social housing with an increased focus and vigour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900030#CC00600","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432054800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The Department has clearly not got the message that there is a major crisis in housing.

In response to the crisis, the Government has allocated money for long-term projects that will take a number of years to deliver.  Emergency measures are required immediately to tackle the scandal of 1,000 children sleeping in homeless accommodation every night.

The service, which helps very vulnerable people, was recently informed by Tusla that it will not receive further funding from the end of June and now faces closure.  I ask the Minister to intervene to protect funding for this valuable service.<\/p><p>I will give one example of an experience shared by a domestic abuse victim.  She writes: <blockquote>My moment of truth came when I saw my two young children hiding under the kitchen table during an &quot;argument&quot; with their father.  I remember seeing four little frightened eyes peering out from under the table and in that moment I realised that this wasn't just about me.  It was damaging the children as well.<\/blockquote>Organisations such as the Westmeath Support Service Against Domestic Abuse step in to provide a voice in the wilderness.  The service is client-centred and cost-effective and is managed by Ms Ann Foley who has built up a valuable relationship over many years with the Courts Service, solicitors, the Garda, social welfare and housing services and others.  This has allowed her to ensure timely interventions are made where and when they become necessary.  As the Minister is aware, crisis intervention frequently requires a fast response.<\/p><p>On 7 May last, Ms Foley received a stark letter from Tusla in which the organisation informed her, without consultation, that it would cease funding the service she provides at the end of June.  This abrupt notification is unacceptable, as was the ruthless manner in which Ms Foley was given a month's notice to shut down the service she provides.  She is suddenly faced with having her meagre funding of &euro;49,000 per annum withdrawn.  <\/p><p>I want to inform the Minister today that this service provides a holistic service for those, primarily women, who are suffering from domestic violence.<br\/><br\/>The Minister should remember too that this is also Ms Foley's job.

There is no need to shout.<\/p>  <p>  The needs of those suffering domestic violence in this country are well known and I certainly would want to see the services that support them supported.  I welcome the opportunity to clarify the Government's approach to the funding of domestic violence services in County Westmeath and around the country.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, with the establishment of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence service provision is under one body with clear national direction.  We now have a single line of accountability and a consolidated national budget which is reserved for allocation to these particular services.  The establishment of Tusla has presented an opportunity to develop new approaches in terms of how best to meet the needs of Ireland's children and families.<\/p>  <p>  Domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services can now be delivered within a broad child and family support framework and this represents a significant change to the previous service delivery model.  Tusla is in receipt of Exchequer funding of &euro;643 million in 2015, including over &euro;12 million in capital funding.  This represents an increase of over &euro;34 million or 5.6% on 2014.  Tusla's budget for the provision of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will be in excess of &euro;19 million in 2015 as opposed to &euro;17 million.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of these services over recent months.  The purpose was to identify strategic priorities and set out a roadmap for the future delivery of sexual violence and domestic violence services.  The review has demonstrated to Tusla that the organisations that provide these services to those who experience domestic violence have operated in difficult environments.  They have made huge efforts to maintain services in the face of funding and other challenges.  However, Tusla considers, arising from the review, that there is scope for a more co-ordinated and more equitable approach to the provision of these services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this process, Tusla has reviewed the configuration of domestic violence services in County Westmeath and has identified scope for some degree of re-organisation and reconstitution of services while ensuring continuity for service users.  Tusla has assured me that there is no question of services in the county being reduced.<\/p>  <p>  Westmeath Support Services Against Domestic Abuse was in receipt of &euro;47,146 in funding from Tusla last year.  In 2015, funding of &euro;23,572 is being allocated with services in the area to be re-configured.  Tusla met the organisation on Friday last, 15 May, and has agreed to a further meeting with the organisation to discuss issues regarding continuity of service.<\/p>  <p>  The funding to Westmeath support services is one component of a reconfiguration of domestic violence service provision in County Westmeath.  The change in funding arrangements constitutes a re-allocation rather than a reduction in funding and Tusla has committed to enhancing the availability of services to women and children experiencing domestic violence in the Westmeath area.  Tusla will continue to engage with stakeholders in County Westmeath around how best to provide domestic violence support services as part of an integrated community-based service and to ensure that responsive services are in place.<\/p>  <p>  At all times, Tusla's key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims of sexual violence are being met in the best way possible.  For this reason, the 2015 budget is being directed towards front-line services and ensuring no potential service is disadvantaged because of geography.  Tulsa, in reviewing the make up of current services, is seeking to address any identified gaps in services, to avoid duplication of services and to support effective delivery of front-line services nationally.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputies that the Government will continue to give a high priority to the provision and development of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services and that Tusla will work closely with service providers in this regard while giving particular priority to supporting front-line services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900032#EE00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1432055400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister's reply.  However, the negative consequences of Tusla's abrupt withdrawal of funding from this organisation cannot be underestimated.

Surely we must protect such funding rather than take it away from organisations.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 January 2014, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, became an independent legal entity and its key remit was to offer support and protection to families and children.

Apart from the elite few, no one has escaped austerity.  It has invaded every home, every classroom, every hospital and all our public services.  Homelessness has reached more families than ever before and our health care system is crumbling.  Job opportunities have reduced while work conditions have declined and our front-line services have been stretched so far beyond their limits that we may never know the full extent of the consequences.  For the unfortunate few, economic recovery will never reach them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's sole focus on fixing an economic deficit has left us with a social one.  Now, amid some vague signs of economic recovery we need to ensure that resources are fairly distributed in the future.  The call to enshrine economic, social and cultural rights is a timely one.  A new Government will sit across this Chamber, regardless of its composition, by the spring of next year.  We want that Government to be held accountable to its citizens as it reconstructs our future.  We want to ensure that everyone has enough to live a dignified life.<\/p>  <p>  When Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann was written in 1937 it was progressive in its time in its consideration of fundamental rights, having been written only 11 years before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.  Today, only civil and political rights are adequately considered in our Constitution, for example, the right to privacy and family life, while there is limited provision for economic, social and cultural rights in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed wording of this Bill is intended to be in addition to the text of Article 45 of the Constitution to the effect that the State shall progressively realise, subject to its maximum available resources and without discrimination, the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and that this duty will be cognisable by the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The international covenant presents economic rights as entailing the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his or her living by freely chosen or accepted work and to just and favourable conditions of work.  Social rights are expressed as the right to social security, protection and assistance of the family; the right of everyone to an adequate standards of living for them and their family, including food, clothing and housing; the continuous improvement of living conditions and the right to be free from hunger; the right of everyone to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health; and the right of everyone to an education.  Cultural rights would protect the right of everyone to take part in cultural life, to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he or she is the author.<\/p>  <p>  Enshrining these rights in the Constitution would bring it into line with the growing trend in many countries that have revised their constitutions to include economic, social and cultural rights.  Twenty-six EU states have made some form of constitutional provision for economic, social and cultural rights.  Internationally, 106 constitutions protect the right to work and 133 constitutions provide the right to health care.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is at the cusp of cultural and social change.  People are calling for a more social justice-led future and an expansion of the protections of human rights.  There is political will in recognising these rights in our Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2014, 85% of the members of the Constitutional Convention voted in favour of amending the Constitution to strengthen the protection of economic, social and cultural rights.  A majority of members of the convention voted in favour of a constitutional provision to progressively realise such rights, subject to the maximum available resources, and to enshrine that this duty be cognisable by the courts.  The convention further voted on whether specific additional rights should be enumerated in the Constitution and it voted in favour of a proposal that all of the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, be enumerated within the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2014, the Constitutional Convention sent a recommendation to the Government to implement these rights and the Government was due to respond by July of that year.  Nearly a year later we are still waiting for a response from the Government to proactively address the status of these rights.<\/p>  <p>  Political will extends to the current Government too.  The Labour Party introduced two Private Members' Bills on this issue - one by Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn in 2000 and the second more recent one by Deputy Kevin Humphreys in 2012.  Prevailing myths and misconceptions about economic, social and cultural rights, combined with a lack of real political will, have hindered their application in Ireland but these misconceptions do not stand up.  The idea that ESC rights are only aspirations and not intended to be part of our judicial system is misconceived.  Decisions in courts in other countries have proven time and again that these rights are legally enforceable.  These rights have been recognised through a wide range of legal systems found but not limited to Finland, Germany, Latvia, Portugal, Argentina, South Africa, India, Brazil, Kenya, Colombia and Mexico.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051900033#FF01000","speaker":"1001"}]
