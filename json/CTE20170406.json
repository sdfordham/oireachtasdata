Apologies have been received from Deputies Aylward, Cassells and MacSharry.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings of 29 and 30 March 2017 agreed?  Agreed.  There is nothing specific arising out of the minutes that will not come up on our agenda so we will move on to correspondence received since our last meeting.  There are a number of items before us.<\/p> <p>  Category A concerns correspondence for today's meeting, namely, items 385A, 386A, 387A, 399A, 402A and 403A.  They are briefing documents and opening statements from Dublin Institute of Technology, NUI Galway and Waterford Institute of Technology in advance of today's meeting.  We will note and publish them.<\/p> <p>  Category B concerns correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-ups to previous meetings.  The first item is 355B(i) and (ii), which is correspondence dated 23 March 2017 held over from last week from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  This is a follow-up to an appearance before the committee on 20 February and a subsequent request for information.  It has already been noted and published.  Having had a better chance to review it, do any members wish to discuss it?  It concerns the European accounts.  If members wish to raise anything in respect of the correspondence, they are free to do so at any subsequent meeting.<\/p> <p>  The next item is 356B, dated 23 March, held over from last week, from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We noted and published it last week.  We just held over consideration of it because it is a substantial document.  I propose to move on but if members wish to raise anything in respect of the correspondence, they can do so at a subsequent meeting.<\/p> <p>  Next are correspondence items 383 (i) to (iii), inclusive, received from the Higher Education Authority, attaching a copy of the Quigley report of the statutory inspection on the relationship between Waterford IT and campus companies and the report by the HEA on the implementation of the Quigley report recommendations by Waterford IT.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  It is relevant to today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  Items 391B(i) and (ii) comprise an e-mail from NAMA on 30 March attaching a letter from the chairman of NAMA referring to comments I made at last week's meeting on the committee's draft report on Project Eagle and information held by NAMA about the chairman.  I think members saw the correspondence at our meeting last Thursday.  We will note and publish the correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The next item is 407B, correspondence received on 5 April 2017 from Mr. Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority correcting a statement made by Dr. Graham Love, chief executive, at a meeting last week.  For the record, the reference was to persons B and C.  They had made a protected disclosure prior to their suspension from work and not the other way around, as had been stated.  It is important people understand that because I took it as it was said on the day but the correction changes the background a little.<\/p> <p>  The next item is 409B, correspondence received on 6 April 2017 from the HSE as a follow-up to a request for further information regarding our meeting with the director general on 9 March.  Did members have an opportunity to consider this?  It is a letter regarding the freedom of information issue in respect of differences of approach in this matter and RTE and the information supplied to us.  The director general also confirms the issue regarding the various staff numbers, H3, H7, H12, H4 and H6, as they relate to the Grace case.  I have read the letter.  The HSE splits hairs as to who raised a timetable and who suggested it.  I propose we send all of this to the commission of investigation.  The key issue of difference between the director general and the RTE correspondence we have received is that the HSE, when it responded to the freedom of information, FOI, request, mentioned the issue of a timetable.  We then took the view that the HSE was suggesting a timetable to be covered by the FOI.  The HSE states that while a timetable was mentioned, it did not suggest a specific timetable.  We are splitting hairs inordinately.  We cannot have a meeting discussing the difference between mentioning a timetable and suggesting a timeframe.  I suggest we just send the correspondence on to the commission because we cannot achieve much more by calling the director general back before the committee.  The differences are all there for the commission to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>It is a bit more than splitting hairs, to be fair, although I understand the point the Chairman makes about the FOI request.  There are two elements to this.  The FOI request is one but there are also the answers the director general gave to the issue as to whether some of those involved in the decision-making regarding the Grace case are still working in the public service.  That was the question he was asked.  Even in his correspondence to us he restates this and at length goes through the individuals' involvement with the HSE, as if that were the question asked.  That was not the question asked.  With respect to the Chairman, it took us a few hours to get some information from the director general when he appeared before the committee before.  For the first time he did place on the record, because of questions from members of the committee, that a second person does in fact work for Tusla.  If we did not have that hearing and if the director general had not come before us, the public would not be aware of that.  We would still be none the wiser.  The reason we asked him to appear before the committee in the first place was to correct the record of a previous hearing and question marks remain as to evidence he presented to us at the last hearing.  It strikes me overall - and I say this generously to the director general - that trying to get straight answers to straight questions from him is like trying to get blood from a stone.  As we all said the last time he was here, given the gravity of the issues involved, that is unacceptable.  We have therefore requested that he come before the Committee of Public Accounts again.  We will obviously be guided by other members as to whether they feel that is appropriate.  However, given that the issues are so serious and that all we are trying to do is correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts and get straight answers to questions, that is the very least we deserve.  We have a job to do.  The Chairman said the last time that we will not be stonewalled by anyone and will not allow anyone to come before the committee, give inaccurate information and then walk away and that is it.  We must put down a marker as a committee that such stonewalling is simply not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#B00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>That is fine.  I only referred specifically to the FOI aspect.  The two conflicting points of view are very well stated.  I do not know how much we will get beyond the publicly-stated positions, but the points Deputy Cullinane makes about the staff and the staff numbers were the original points we invited the HSE in to discuss.  The Deputy's point is well made in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#B00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I concur with my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.  We should have him back before the committee.  This matter would be much simpler if people simply co-operated with the committee, but there are a number of outstanding issues on which we need clarity from him.  We need him to put those on the record.  It should not be a long meeting if he comes before the committee in the right frame of mind.  Specifically, I endorse the point Deputy Cullinane made about future hearings of the committee.  People coming before us need to understand that if they mislead the committee, whether by accident or design, and if they are invited back to correct the record, they do not come in and for a second time sow confusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#B00500","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I think Mr. O'Brien should be brought back.  I see the Chairman's point that the correspondence should be sent to the commission.  However, Mr. O'Brien should come back before this committee.  His testimony was extracted like pulling teeth without anaesthetic.  It was difficult.  I particularly zoned in on the staff.  It is now confirmed that two of the staff work with Tusla.  That was dragged out.  I also asked about public procurement.

Has it been published?  We were to look at that issue in terms of the costs and whether the voluntary body was given sufficient funds.  They are serious issues because when I asked if any money had been provided for Grace in view of the trauma she has suffered, I was told nothing had been given.  In the middle of trying to extract information without anaesthetic, we might forget what we are about, which is that the head of the Health Service Executive should be absolutely upfront with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#C00700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>There is a consensus that we should invite Mr. O'Brien back.  I agree with Deputy McDonald that it would be helpful if we can close it off and be concise.  I therefore ask all members to contact the secretary with a list of specific queries for Mr. O'Brien so that when he comes to the committee he will have the complete answers rather than members raising issues on the day and he having to come back again.  It would be helpful for the efficient running of the committee.  He is genuinely not available next week.  We will ask the secretary to arrange a date as soon as practical.  It will be as soon as possible after Easter.  I ask members to submit their specific queries so he can be put on notice of precise issues.  We will be conscious of the points that have been made today.<\/p> <p>  The next item is category C in regard to correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  No. 373C is correspondence received on 24 March 2017 from an individual referring to inappropriate language used by Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, while he was at the committee.  While the correspondent is sure Mr. O'Brien did not mean to cause offence with a particular term used, he or she makes the valid point that it should be brought to Mr. O'Brien's attention.  I propose we forward a copy of the correspondence to Mr. O'Brien.  There was a particular use of words by Mr. O'Brien that could have been interpreted in an uncomplimentary manner.  It was perhaps not the most appropriate language to use in that case.  It is a fair point that the correspondent makes and we will forward it to Mr. O'Brien.  Is that agreed?  Agreed<\/p> <p>  No. 389C is correspondence dated 30 March 2017 from an individual following on from a letter from the committee in which we advised her of how her complaints against the HSE, the Garda and her previous employer could best be dealt with.  While I believe we can only reiterate that she should use the structures of the State available to deal with individual cases, I note she also raises the issue of the pharmaceutical company Novartis which she raised with us in another item of correspondence.  We have written to the Department on this issue and I propose we forward any reply we receive.  Is it agreed that we write to the individual along these lines.  Agreed<\/p> <p>  Nos. 390C and 392C are correspondence received on 30 March and 3 April from an individual referred to as Person A in regard to the University of Limerick meeting last week.  She requests the opportunity to meet with the PAC to give her side of what happened.  I also want to point out that there are three more items of correspondence from former employees of the University of Limerick.  We dealt with three third level institutions last week and we will be dealing with three today.  When we have the six done, we will review where we stand.  A significant amount of correspondence has been received from former employees of the University of Limerick.  We need to consider it all after today's meeting so we will hold this item over.  We will note it and come back to it.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 397C and 404C are correspondence received on 4 April 2017 from individuals referred to as Person B and Person C in our meeting last week with University of Limerick.  Similarly, we will note that correspondence, hold it over and come back to it.<\/p> <p>  No. 406C is correspondence received on 5 April 2017 from another individual and ex-employee of University of Limerick.  We will note that correspondence, hold it over and come back to it when we are finished our hearing with the third level instructions.<\/p> <p>  No. 393C is correspondence received on 31 March from an individual in relation to the fair deal scheme and the person&rsquo;s experience of fitness programmes for elderly people.  I propose that we write to the individual informing him that the adoption of such programmes is a policy matter and not within the remit of the committee.  We are dealing with the fair deal scheme with the HSE.  Nursing Homes Ireland have written to us separately.  We will consider it as part of the total correspondence.  It may not be within our remit but when we close off the issue of the nursing homes, we can dispose of it at that stage.  There might be something in it that we can refer on to the Minister in the future.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 394C (i) and(ii) were received on 29 March 2017 from an individual alleging waste of taxpayers' funds in the Irish Prison Service.  The person wishes to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the inadequacy of the internal audit unit to properly police and protect the rights of someone who raised concerns with the PAC.  Is the correspondence noted?  Noted.  Should we ask for a response from the Prison Service on it?  I have not yet had an opportunity to do so.  The correspondent is asking us only to note it and to be aware of it, not to take specific action.  We will note it.<\/p> <p>  No. 395C (i) to (xi) are a copy of correspondence sent to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 31 March. The correspondence refers to the waste of taxpayers' money and harassment of a family.   Has it been sent to other Ministers?  We will note it.  We have not been asked to do anything specific.  It is only a copy for our information.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 370C and 396C.  Item 370C was held over from last week and 396C was received on 22 March 2017.  It refers to fraud allegations in Teagasc in regard to the selection process for a post of responsibility in 2007.  The clerk has reviewed correspondence with the previous committee going back to 2015 on this issue.  A response was sought by the committee at the time from Teagasc in regard to the issues raised.  Teagasc provided comprehensive background on the case, which had gone through an internal grievance procedure, been referred to a rights commissioner service and gone through a Labour Court hearing.  The person&rsquo;s claims were not upheld in any of the three processes.  A copy of the Teagasc response was sent to the individual by the committee on 26 January.  I propose that we hold this over with a view to writing a detailed letter.  We will be able to close off this matter but I have not yet had an opportunity to see the letter from the previous committee.  I want to be consistent or at least aware of that.  We will have that circulated.  When we see how the former committee approached this matter, we will deal with it at that stage.<\/p> <p>  No. 398C is correspondence received on 3 April from an individual in relation to Waterford IT and campus companies such as FeedHenry.  Can we note this for today's meeting?  Noted. <\/p> <p>  The next item is reports, statements and accounts received.  There are two items, first, the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, and the European fisheries fund for Irish operations with a turnover of &euro;1.6 billion for the end of 2015 as per the auditor's report; and, second, a file concerning the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, and the Loughs Agency 2015 accounts clear audited opinion.  We will note those items.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  It is on the screen in front of the members.  Today, we will have Waterford Institute of Technology followed by the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In session two, we will have the National University of Ireland, Galway.  Next Thursday, we will have the Department of Education and Skills dealing with the special report on the cost of the child abuse inquiry and redress scheme.  Caranua is also invited to that session.  We will have to work out whether we take both together or deal with them separately, but that can be decided during the week.  Many people who were affected by this issue have expressed an interest in being here or watching the proceedings.  I will facilitate anybody who makes such a request.<\/p> <p>  On 4 May 2017, we will be dealing with Bord na gCon.  On 11 May 2017, we will deal with the Department of Justice and Equality appropriation accounts for 2015.  There is a specific chapter dealing with the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision.  Sometime around the date of the last meeting, we noted the report by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the Templemore issue.  There is also the issue of the different slant to the Garda Commissioner's evidence before this committee a couple of years ago compared with her evidence at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality last week.<\/p><p>Would it be too much if we bring in the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with direct provision and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all on the one day?

The institute&rsquo;s consolidated income for the year amounted to over &euro;99 million.  As seen in the graphic in the submission, State grant funding of &euro;28 million accounted for more than a quarter of that total.  Tuition fee income of nearly &euro;31 million included fees of &euro;7.4 million paid by the State and student contribution income of over &euro;15 million.  In addition, research grant income of &euro;19.5 million was recognised in the year.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure in the year was nearly &euro;96 million.  Of that, around 68% was accounted for by staff costs.  A detailed analysis of expenditure is given in note 11 of the accounts.<\/p> <p>  While the consolidated accounts show an operating surplus of &euro;3.7 million for the year, the audit certificate notes that the group had an accumulated deficit of over &euro;15 million at 31 August 2014.  The institute addresses the question of the group&rsquo;s financial position in note 24, and concludes that it remained appropriate at the date of signing to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the institute&rsquo;s financial position, the accumulated deficit prior to the consolidation of the subsidiaries was &euro;3.3 million.  After consolidation and taking into account the current year surplus, the deficit is now over &euro;15 million at 31 August 2014, as outlined in note 19 to the financial statements.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a qualified audit opinion in respect of the financial statements, arising from the failure of the institute to include comparative information for the prior year in its consolidated income and expenditure account for 2013-14.<\/p> <p>  The institute&rsquo;s subsidiaries were incorporated into the financial statements for the first time in 2013-14.  Note 19 explains that prior year comparatives were not available because the subsidiaries&rsquo; financial statements for 2012-13 covered a 14-month period.  The relevant accounting standard provides that, in such cases, amounts for the prior year should be adjusted, with the basis for adjustment disclosed.  Accordingly, the audit concluded that it would have been appropriate for the institute to include adjusted comparable figures for 2012-13.<\/p> <p>  The governance code for institutes of technology provides that audit committees should submit an annual report on their activities to an institution&rsquo;s governing body.  The audit certificate also draws attention to the fact that the audit committee in Waterford IT did not issue an annual report for 2013-14 to the governing body until June 2015.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s recent special report on financial reporting in the public sector identified Waterford IT as the only institute of technology that had not completed its financial reporting for 2013-14 by the end of 2015; that audit was subsequently certified in October 2016.  In terms of the 2014-15 audit cycle, Waterford IT is now the only institute of technology for which the audit has not been completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Drinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I invite Professor Donnelly to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#E00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Chairman, I came in without a copy of the opening statement.

I wish to begin by setting my remarks in context.<\/p> <p>  The institute&rsquo;s current situation needs to be considered in the context, first of all, of demonstrable under-investment in the third level sector over a decade or more and, moreover, inequalities in the ways funding is distributed between institutes of technology, IoTs, and universities.  Some aspects of that are outlined in our briefing document but in summary, between 2008 and 2015, State investment in the IoT sector in general dropped by 50% while student numbers increased by 30%.<\/p> <p>  As we saw in our briefing, our mission is to serve our students, the citizens and the communities of the south east and our social, industrial, cultural and commercial partners and stakeholders - regional, national and international.  Since its foundation in 1970, the institute has responded proactively to the region&rsquo;s needs and with huge success, evolving from a provider of vocational training programmes to a research-led, internationally respected educational institution.<\/p> <p>  In the past ten years,  the institute has successfully attracted over &euro;135 million in competitively sourced research funding from various sources.  We have been instrumental in attracting knowledge intensive industries to the south east region and Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, has been vital to job creation and regional development.  Since 2008, WIT has signed 34 licences and been involved in the spin out of ten companies resulting in the creation of more than 600 high impact jobs in Waterford.  Enterprise Ireland, in a statement to the Committee of Public Accounts on 31 January 2013, stated: \"Waterford is a shining example of how co-locating the incubation centre with the institute has led to the establishment of a software industry that probably should not have existed in Waterford.\".<\/p> <p>  The institute has played a pivotal role in the transformation of Waterford city as a leading high impact digital and advanced manufacturing economy.  A key example of this is FeedHenry, a spin out of Waterford Institute of Technology, which created 50 jobs.  It was recently acquired by Red Hat.  Red Hat announced an investment of &euro;12.7 million in a new project which will create an additional 60 jobs, going some way to address the unemployment deficit in the city.<\/p><p>At the same time, the institute's record in promoting regional access and participation is also extremely strong.  Approximately half of our undergraduate intake is from sources other than the leaving certificate student cohort.  Over one third of our full-time learners come from target socioeconomic groups, approximately 10% of our students are registered with our disability office and almost 3,400 students at the institute are currently receiving some form of grant.<\/p><p> WIT's current situation must be set in the context of these efforts to address regional need while at the same time bearing catastrophic funding cuts.  The success we have had over many years in the research domain and in access give just two examples of the hard work of our management and staff in the interests of the region despite the restrictions imposed on the institute.<\/p><p> I turn now to addressing the items specifically referred to in the committee's correspondence.  In respect of the institute's 2013-14 financial statements, the delay was, first, as a result of the institute complying with a request from the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a substantial policy change which required a full review of research income and a change in the policy relating to the recognition of research overheads, a change that was requested across all third level institutions.  Second, 2013-14 was the first year the institute was required to consolidate the financial activities of the subsidiary companies which were the subject of the Quigley report, issued in June 2013 by the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p> For the year ending 2013-14 the institute's financial statements, before consolidation, record a surplus of &euro;1.168 million compared to a deficit in the prior year of &euro;306,000.  General expenditure in the year increased by 0.9%, largely due to increases in utility costs.  However, State recurrent grant fell by &euro;2.78 million compared to the previous year, that is 9%.  Some of this deficit was offset by an increase in student contribution and tuition fees particularly as non-EU fees increased by &euro;1.55 million.<\/p><p> Also in that financial year, the subsidiary companies reported an annual financial profit of &euro;1.096 million.  However, the consolidation required the alignment of policies in relation to the treatment of assets, deferred capital grants and reserves, both recurrent and capital, and this necessitated a transfer of &euro;26.936 million from revenue reserves to capital reserves, hence creating the deficit the committee has just heard about. <\/p><p> In the year prior to consolidation we moved the financial year end of the subsidiary companies to 31 August rather than 30 June, in order to bring the financial year end in line with the institute's.  A consequence of this approach is that comparative 12 month figures for the year ending 31 August 2013 were not available to include in the consolidated income and expenditure account.<\/p><p> The overall financial position of the institute remains difficult; funding levels have not yet been fully restored to the third level sector as highlighted by the financial review published by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in October 2016.  That report indicates that the future sustainability of the institute of technology, IoT, sector is under threat and that there is a \"critical need for investment in order for the sector to survive and flourish\".  The WIT executive is focused on addressing matters associated with the financial situation that are within its control.<\/p><p> As reflected in the higher education sector systems performance 2014-2016, the institute places a high degree of emphasis on good practice, corporate governance and internal audit.  The audit committee was reconstituted and greatly strengthened in December 2013, following the recommendations of the Quigley report; the detail is included in our briefing statement.  It was an administrative error that the report mentioned in PAC's correspondence was not furnished to the governing body in the year ending 31 August 2013 within the acceptable timeframe.  However, the records and minutes held in the institute confirm that the governing body was, and remains, fully apprised of the work of the audit committee.<\/p><p> Finally, with regard to the technological university process, WIT remains committed to the provision of enhanced educational opportunities and an enhanced innovation and development infrastructure for the south east.  This is needed by the people of the south east and demanded by all our stakeholders.  The technological universities legislation currently under consideration will enable the provision of that enhanced higher education infrastructure.  In this context, we continue to engage with our colleagues in IT Carlow to explore the potential to create that new entity.<\/p><p> The institute made a successful application for funding, with our partner, IT Carlow, in support of the engagement process to the HEA and the agreed project plan for this will see the institute complete the commencement and activation phases of the process by the end of 2017.

I have to make an important statement before we commence our meeting.<\/p> <p>  The accounts the president presented here today cover the period 1 September 2013 to 31 August 2014.  The institute has not completed the audit of the accounts for any period since then.  For any organisation to come to the Committee on Public Accounts with accounts that are three years old is a disgrace.  It is insulting to the committee and to the Irish taxpayer that an organisation as big as WIT should be putting our committee in a position of wasting its time discussing items that are three years old.<\/p> <p>  I also note the other colleges here before us today, the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, whose accounts also only cover the period 2013-2014.  Its accounts are three years out of date and it expects us to spend our time discussing them.  In respect of the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, the accounts before us today are for the same period, 2013-14.  I am informed by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office that it has recently certified the accounts for 2015 but they have not yet been published.<\/p> <p>  If anybody came into the president's organisation applying for any position in WIT, and I would say the same for NUIG and DIT, with a curriculum vitae, CV, that was three years out of date they would not get an interview.  These three third level institutions expect to take the time of the Committee on Public Accounts, the national Parliament discussing items that are three years out of date.  There are very important issues we do need to discuss and this puts us in a dilemma.<\/p> <p>  I am also sending a signal to every other public body that ever comes in here with accounts out of date, they will get short shrift.  I am also directing my comments to the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills who allow this position to continue.  I find it unacceptable that the Department would roll out money, year in year out, for the Estimates in 2015, 2016 and 2017 without sight of up to date audited accounts from the witnesses' organisation.  Due to the seriousness of this situation we are now suspending the meeting while the committee goes into private session to discuss whether it will proceed with today's events.  <\/p> <p>  The meeting is now suspended.

The plan is to discuss with Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and the National University of Ireland, Galway, issues concerning their financial statements.  We note that none of the three organisations has completed audited or published their accounts for any period since August 2014.  The committee is gravely dissatisfied at being presented with information that is at least three years out of date.  It reduces the impact of the effectiveness of the reporting structure of those organisations to this committee.<\/p> <p>  We have invited the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills back first on this occasion, so that the committee can discuss the whole question of their role in ensuring that this sector operates properly.<\/p> <p>  Last week, we heard from three other third level institutions.  One of their accounts was for the same period, the year ended August 2014.  The other two accounts were for 2015.  This matter has exercised this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Comptroller and Auditor General recently published a report on the timeliness of publishing financial statements.  <\/p> <p>  We will start by asking Ms Colette Drinan from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to comment.  Committee members will then have some questions to pose.  We believe that it is fine looking at individual colleges, but the idea that year in and year out they can get funding without us seeing sight of the previous year's financial statement is not adequate from our point of view.  It should not be adequate from the Department's viewpoint either.  We will therefore be asking the representatives to take our views back for action to the Department as a result of this discussion.  It is our intention to resume the meeting with Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and the National University of Ireland, Galway, once we have completed this session because of the serious issues we want to discuss.  People will see the grave and unacceptable situation in which the committee is placed by being presented with accounts that are three years out of date.

It is entirely unacceptable that institutes of higher education, whoever they are, can float in here with archaic, out of date records.  I want, therefore, an assurance from everybody concerned that they understand that is not on and has to stop.  Whatever steps they have to take to straighten that out, whether it is the Department, the HEA or elsewhere, it should be straightened out.  It is not acceptable to the committee or taxpayers who fund all of this, and they also fund the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA.<\/p> <p>  I am alarmed at what is unfolding in a piecemeal fashion in respect of this sector.  It strikes me that in terms of governance and good practice that the higher education sector is in a mess.  Alongside this committee, the Department and the HEA are responsible for overseeing and insisting that this mess is straightened out.  It strikes me that some of these institutes are personal fiefdoms.  They seem to be run almost like the wild west and that is not good enough.  I want to be helpful by making some requests and suggestions.  First, in respect of the governance of these institutions I do not believe that we have had a comprehensive or fully frank account of what has happened or what has been revealed by whistleblowers in terms of how their disclosures have been processed and managed, or how those individuals have been treated.  <\/p> <p>  I recall that, back in 2014, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; from the Department of Education and Skills, who, unfortunately, is not with us today, informed us that he had given an instruction that the whistleblower matters were to be resolved or sorted out with an eye to the new legislation.  I do not believe that happened, however.  It is as simple as that.  I am not convinced and I need to be convinced that it happened.  Therefore I would like to get a comprehensive written account from the Department and the HEA in respect of protected disclosures made in each of these institutions.  The witnesses do not have to give us identities - that is not necessary - but I want a full account of how those matters were processed and how people were held to account at every level, up to and including the boards and paid executives of these institutions.  I would like the Department and the HEA to furnish us with a full bird's eye view of exactly what happened without delay.  We would then have to consider that information and see how we can move forward.  <\/p> <p>  I am citing whistleblowers but I could also cite human resources departments and their processes, or many other facets.  As our starting point, however, we should focus on the whistleblowers because let us remember that is the genesis of much of the information on malpractice that has been uncovered and which we now have.<\/p> <p>  My second point concerns the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Deputy Connolly raised earlier the inability of the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit foundations.  I share her concerns in that regard.<\/p><p>I want to pinpoint a related but more specific issue, intellectual property, the commercialisation of intellectual property and the spin-off companies that arise from it.  It is about the money that is generated by the commercialisation of intellectual property, what goes where and who gains from it.  I am very concerned that the taxpayer, the Committee of Public Accounts and the witnesses do not have proper oversight of exactly what is happening in that dynamic across the higher education sector.  I am absolutely determined that we get to the bottom of it, that we get concrete assurances on governance arrangements and conflicts of interests.  From the point of view of the taxpayer, we should get an absolute assurance that when as taxpayers we invest in learning and innovation, we are getting a return on it and are fostering an environment in which innovation is encouraged and prolonged.  I am worried that this process is allowing opportunities for private gain by individuals or corporates and is leaving the taxpayer behind.<\/p><p> I wish to put a proposition to the Comptroller and Auditor General that a special investigation be conducted into the commercialisation of intellectual property and that the protocols and processes be examined institute by institute.  <\/p><p> All members know that this sector is absolutely essential for the growth and development of society for the benefit of our children and ourselves and for the knowledge economy.  This is the pulse and is where it happens or not.  I am concerned about the messing and the sloppiness.  I think the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority have been asleep at the wheel.  I cannot arrive at any other conclusion when one sees the absolute mess that surrounds these institutes.  I hope that from today, not just the individual colleges but the system will understand that this is not good enough.  That needs to stop.  <\/p><p> I am making two firm propositions to the HEA and the Department on whistleblowers and governance.  I am requesting the Comptroller and Auditor General to get under the bonnet of the commercialisation of intellectual property and the very considerable resources and money that are generated through that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#H00500","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I will take a comment from Deputies Cullinane, Catherine Murphy and Connolly in that sequence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#J00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I concur with everything my colleague, Deputy McDonald has said in the first instance and also the opening comments of the Chairman on the out-of-date and archaic accounts which were presented to us.  This prevents the members of the Committee of Public Accounts from doing our job.  Our job is to ensure that we do a look-back exercise over how taxpayers' money is spent.  We need information from State bodies, institutes of technology and universities to allow us to do our job fairly.  We always put questions without fear or favour.  Our only role is to protect taxpayers and the interests of institutes, be they institutes of technology or universities.<\/p><p>Dr. Graham Love appeared before the committee a number of weeks ago.  It was probably his first appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and in his opening statement he stated the Higher Education Authority, HEA, had done a review of governance<b><\/b>across different sectors.  What strikes me, and Deputy McDonald referred to it, is that no review was conducted on intellectual property spin-outs.  My understanding is that the spin-outs are in part the responsibility of an arm of Enterprise Ireland.  I think that is completely unacceptable because Enterprise Ireland has a vested interest.  In my view it must be anchored in the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills.There are question marks around who is minding the shop and who within institutes is protecting the interests of those institutes.  It appears to me that the institutes are at arm's length from the Department and the HEA.  The institutes are given far too much latitude and far too much independence.  The relationship between the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills and the institutes is not what it should be in terms of governance and oversight.  I agree with my colleague that it is not good enough for the members of this committee.  The members of the Committee of Public Accounts do their best.  We invite people to appear before the committee and put them through their paces, in that we ask them questions and listen to their responses and then that is the end of it.  The following year we do the same and the same problems come up.  That is not good enough.  I agree with the comments made by Teachta McDonald that it is a bit like the wild west in terms of how some of this has been managed.  This is not acceptable.  I concur that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, notwithstanding its heavy workload and resource issues, should do a special report on the spin-outs from intellectual property.  In my view this area is completely unregulated.  It is absolutely light-touch regulation.  We will see examples of this when one of the institutes comes before us.  I concur with the recommendation that the Comptroller and Auditor General would do a special report but also that both the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills would furnish us with reports on governance and oversight on accounts, managing conflicts of interest and the whistleblowers issue that Deputy McDonald raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#J00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>We will ask for a response when the members have put their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#J00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I am absolutely surprised at the time we will have to expend on this sector.

The witnesses can see all the paper we have.  We are struggling.  We are not accountants and we are struggling here looking at 3%, 5% and 8% of intellectual property rights being sold off to private companies.  When I asked Dr. Love about that, he told me that Enterprise Ireland had a policy on it.  Like my colleagues who are here today, it shocked me that Enterprise Ireland would set the policy for education.  It truly shocked me.  I am not sure what the HEA is doing.  I do not wish to be personal but the HEA seems to be reacting rather than being proactive about intellectual property rights, which belong to the people.<\/p><p> What is happening to the whistleblowers is very unfair.  We are talking about a small place.  Whistleblowers are being identified here, albeit not by name.  They are writing letters to members of this committee which are being referred onto the Chairman.  We are now in a position where we are arguing about who said what, which is not our role.  This is not a court of law but a place to bring accountability.  Clearly, if whistleblowers are coming forward in such numbers, there is something seriously wrong with accountability.  We then find ourselves acting as judge, which we do not want to be at all.  Whistleblowers are asking to appear before this committee which is something we are going to have to consider.<\/p><p> Foundations are being set up and the universities seem to have washed their hands of them.  The foundation accounts are not being consolidated.  Clearly, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said that it is a matter of control and the universities do not have control.  He is limited in that way.  There is nothing wrong with the universities submitting the foundation accounts in an open and accountable manner to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  NUI Galway, for example, only introduced a mechanism last year but is clapping itself on the back for setting up a formal procedure for processing payments.  As someone with very varied experience, I am absolutely reeling.<\/p><p> I wish to turn to the professor from Waterford with regard to his opening statement, which captures it.  We had the Quigley report and the comments from the HEA on that report dating back to 2013.  I would have thought that the first sentence of his opening statement would have been that there were more than 40 recommendations and all of them have been implemented.<\/p><p> The issues of intellectual property rights and whistleblowers will have to be addressed.

However, when the taxpayer gets 1% of the spin-out company, we have no idea whether that even covers the costs incurred by the taxpayer.  What accounting mechanisms are in place to keep track of the costs being incurred by the taxpayer in relation to this intellectual property which is ultimately privatised, with the State only getting 1% or 2%?

However, I want to provide assurance that there is a policy and protocol in place, as well as local policies in all the institutions, that is rigorous and which stands up to international standards.

I understand from talking to the Comptroller and Auditor General that his office is satisfied with where the institutions are at in terms of their responsiveness to updating the accounts.  I also want to stress that we have put in place a governance framework for higher education over the last two years which has involved a number of steps to provide further reassurance.  It involves things like regular liaison and reporting with the Comptroller and Auditor General and an early warning system.  We now have financial contracts in place with the higher education institutions that insist on those institutions having their draft accounts ready within six months of the year end.  We have established rolling reviews to look at particular governance issues.  The first one was on procurement because we recognise that procurement across the higher education sector is not good enough.  We have revised our annual governance reporting templates to take account of all the issues around governance that are becoming apparent.  We take it absolutely seriously.  We have new reporting arrangements in place with the Department of Education and Skills around a risk register, financial accountability framework and a system performance framework.

When one takes out some of the issues and examines them in the manner in which this committee has done, it is quite disconcerting.  We have been working with the people to whom committee members referred, namely, the whistleblowers.  I have been meeting them individually, talking to them and trying to get to a situation where we can address their issues.  We do not want them to be in limbo, looking in all directions in an effort to have their concerns addressed.  As recently as two weeks ago I spent three hours with some of them.  We are moving to address particular issues and have been discussing them with the University of Limerick and the HEA to try to find a mechanism to move forward.<\/p><p>I accept the Chairman's frustration but from our perspective, we are dealing with these issues.  As Mr. Brownlee said, some of these issues go back to 2013-2014.  We have been working on it.  Over the past year, there has been much more liaison and discussion with the Comptroller and Auditor General than before so the situation has improved greatly.  There have been a number of meetings between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Secretary General, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the HEA, the Comptroller and Auditor General, ourselves and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have been doing all this to address the issues that are there.  These things are unacceptable and need to be addressed but I assure the committee we have been addressing them.  We are working on them and we are trying to put better systems in place to ensure the committee is not in this position and will not be addressing these issues in the time to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christy Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>We will try to wrap up this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#L00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for those responses.

What is important in terms of the first request, at least for our institute, is the requirement that one raises funding from the marketplace.  The requirement on FeedHenry was to raise &euro;500,000 in investment.  Once that happens the IP is assigned to the company.  The institute still retains the right to recoup the IP if the company fails.  What happened was the person who entered into negotiation on behalf of FeedHenry agreed that there would be assignment of the IP to the company if it raised &euro;500,000 and in return for that the institute would get a percentage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Willie Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>What was the percentage shareholding the institute got initially?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#N00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491465600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>It originally got 12%, which was diluted on the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Willie Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Why 12%?

Why was that policy change made in the first instance?  We were advised by the HEA and the Department that there is an internal review into all of this in Waterford.  Why did it take 14 months for Professor Donnelly to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts about him being a director?  Why is there now an internal review in Waterford IT?  The person carrying out the internal review is the financial controller.  The financial controller is a subordinate of the president.  The financial controller sits on the commercialisation committee.  In answer to a parliamentary question, I was informed that the president had to delegate responsibility regarding this internal review because of potential conflicts of interest, which also causes me concern because even as president there are conflicts of interest that now have to be managed.  I am alarmed and concerned that people may be wearing multiple hats and are not in a position to do the job they are well paid to do.<\/p> <p>  I am really interested in this and the committee should also be interested in it.  Why is there an internal review in Waterford now?  What triggered that internal review?  What brought it about?  Why is it happening now?  I say this to the representatives of the HEA and the Department.  An internal review that is carried out by a subordinate of the president, carried out by somebody who is in the chain of command in terms of decision making - or at least the office was, although the person concerned may not have been - where that person would have sat and does sit on the commercialisation committee, is absolutely and completely unacceptable.  We need an external review.  It has to be external given the dynamics here.  I am looking for a commitment from the HEA that we will get that here today because it is necessary.<\/p> <p>  I could say much more because I have been given a huge amount of information.  I said at the start that I have a friendly relationship with Professor Donnelly.  I have been given a lot of protected disclosures by people within the institute and I have no doubt we will come back to this issue.  I have not even put any of the allegations that were made by people in those protected disclosures to Professor Donnelly.  There are many of them and they are of concern to me.  I am not satisfied with the internal review.<\/p> <p>  Let me be clear on the questions I am putting.  Why did it take 14 months for Professor Donnelly to correct the record of the Committee of Public Accounts?  What was the trigger for this internal review?  What brought it about?  Who made the decision to carry out the internal review?  How can an internal review take place which is actually being carried out by a subordinate of the president's and someone who sat on the commercialisation committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#P01400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>We have got those questions.

I am concerned that there might be a perception on the part of some that there is something wrong with individual researchers benefiting.  It is written into the national policy and international policies that researchers should be incentivised to gain from intellectual property they develop.  The second thing I would like to say and, again, I stress that I am talking at the entire higher education system level, is that it is not unusual for the stake of an institution one of whose researchers develops intellectual property in which the institution takes a stake to be significantly diluted down during the process of maturing the product or service that is ultimately sold.  I said this last week.  I will give an international example to help the committee.  University College London, UCL, a serious institution of high repute that is very good at research and spinning out and commercialising research, spun out a company called Biovex a number of years ago.  This involved immunotherapies for cancer - initially melanoma.  There were several rounds of investment.  UCL initially had a 20% stake so it was even higher than some of the things we discussed here today but, again, this is not unusual.  This stake got diluted through the various rounds of investment.  Eventually, that company was bought by Amgen, an international biotechnology company, for &euro;1 billion in 2014.  I do not know UCL's actual percentage stake by that stage but it was 0.00 something.  The institution and the researcher got thousands of dollars out of the figure of &euro;1 billion.  I am using this example to make the case that it is not unusual for that to happen.  What is really important is that UCL's reputation as a place of great science and technology that attracts industries, capital and big companies looking to hire people was significantly enhanced.  UCL uses it as a case study.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#Q03700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I do not know.

The value lies in the employment of people locally, the reputation of the institution, the attraction of further enterprises to collaborating with that institution and the attraction of further academic staff and students who want to go there.

When someone is head of research and innovation, they hold a well-paid job and a demanding role.  They should have to make a choice between the management, executive and oversight role and innovation.  If they want to go into the innovation space, by all means they should go into the innovation space.

I go back to what Enterprise Ireland said about creating an industry that should not have been in Waterford.  I could have solved the problem with the conflict of interest and saved myself a journey up here because as the PI of one of the world leading telecommunications research groups, I created IP.  I could have licensed the IP to FDIs, my financial partners, including Cisco, Intel, IBM.  That IP would have gone out of the south east and it would not have created jobs in the region.  I took a decision to focus on creating employment in the south east.  Of course, that created conflict but the institute was mature enough, had these structures and was aware enough of those conflicts.  What I am proud of today as the first vice-president of research in WIT and as its president is that at least 600 families are raising children and working in Waterford who ordinarily would not have been.  They are contributing to the social and cultural life of Waterford.  This is a blackspot.  We take our responsibility as an institute seriously regarding the economic, social and cultural development of Waterford.  I have no doubt and I am clear when I look in the mirror that Willie Donnelly did everything as he was supposed to do and my commitment was not for financial gain.  It happened as a side effect and my commitment was to the social and economic development of a region that I care passionately for.  I am a Kildare man; I am not even a south east man.

The first relates to Dublin Institute of Technology's financial year ending on 31 August 2014 and the second relates to the Grangegorman Development Agency for 2015.  The accounts for Dublin Institute of Technology show an operating surplus of &euro;4.1 million on normal operating activities for the 2013-14 financial year.  After taking account of transactions relating to development of the site at Grangegorman, the net operating surplus for the year was just over &euro;2 million.  The institute's total income for the year amounted to nearly &euro;168 million.  As seen in the graphic, State grant funding, at nearly &euro;73 million, represented the largest income source.  Tuition fees of just over &euro;59 million included &euro;12.3 million in fees paid by the State and student contribution income of &euro;29.5 million.  The institute&rsquo;s operating expenditure for the year was nearly &euro;164 million, with staff costs accounting for just over two thirds of that figure.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the institute's financial statements, but he drew attention to two issues in his audit report.  Expenditure is deemed by the audit to be non-effective where full value has not been received for payments made.  The institute has referred on page 5 of its financial statements to a prepayment of nearly &euro;700,000 made in July 2014 to a provider of library services.  The prepayment related to services to be provided during 2015.  However, the parent company of the service provider was declared bankrupt in September 2014.  As a result, the institute did not receive any of the contracted services in return for the payment made and did not receive any reimbursement. <\/p> <p>  The audit certificate also draws attention to a disclosure in the institute's accounts regarding instances of non-compliance with public procurement requirements.  The value of goods and services that were not subject to competitive tendering during the year was &euro;5.1 million. <\/p> <p>  The Grangegorman Development Agency is a statutory agency which was established in 2006 to develop educational, health care and other facilities on the former St. Brendan's Hospital grounds in Grangegorman.<\/p><p>The education facilities are funded by the Department of Education and Skills and Dublin Institute of Technology.  The institute aims to transfer most of its activities to the Grangegorman campus by 2021.  The healthcare facilities are funded by the Health Service Executive.  As illustrated in the graphic contained in literature given to members, in 2016 the agency received total funding of &euro;21.6 million.  At the end of December 2015, the agency's financial statements record land and buildings of &euro;116 million, of which &euro;41 million is land transferred from the HSE.  In regard to the buildings of &euro;74 million, &euro;54 million was funded by the Department of Education and Skills and &euro;21 million was funded by the institute.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear opinion in respect of the agency's 2015 financial statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Drinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491465600,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s session.  I am accompanied by three colleagues - Mr. Denis Murphy, director of corporate services; Dr. Noel O&rsquo;Connor, director of student development with internal responsibility for the DIT campus development; and Mr. Colm Whelan, head of finance.  I would also like to acknowledge our colleagues from the Grangegorman Development Agency, Mr. Gerard Casey, chief executive, and Mr. Peter O&rsquo;Sullivan, finance director.<\/p> <p>  DIT has provided technological education in Dublin since 1887, continually evolving to meet the educational needs of successive generations.  Today, DIT is one of the largest higher education institutions in Ireland with over 20,000 students and 2,000 staff.  Our role centres on learning, teaching, research, technology transfer, promoting innovation and engagement with industry partners, community partners, professional bodies, and Government agencies.  Our activities address a range of ages and levels, from leading a training programme for the child care sector in inner city Dublin, continuing development of apprenticeship, undergraduate degree programmes, to PhD research.  A distinctive aspect is the range of access pathways which enable and facilitate progress to the highest level of individual achievement.  Approximately 5,000 students graduate each year from purpose-driven programmes that are practice-based and research-informed.  They are our best ambassadors.  Over 100,000 DIT graduates contribute to society and every sector of the economy, from those just entering their careers to those in leadership positions in Ireland and across the world.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee will have received our submission on the DIT consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 August 2014 which refers particularly to liquidation of a supplier of library services to DIT, procurement non-compliance, progress on a technological university for Dublin and the Grangegorman campus development.  I confirm that we take our responsibilities in all financial matters very seriously.  We continue to address procurement non-compliance as highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  DIT has continued to balance its budget over what has been a challenging period and I commend my colleagues and our students whose significant co-operation has enabled us to achieve this.  It is of particular regret that this was made more difficult when DIT incurred a major additional cost due to the liquidation of a long-time supplier.<\/p> <p>  To deliver the best opportunities for our students, DIT is developing a new campus in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city at Grangegorman and creating a technological university for Dublin with our partners in the institutes of technology in Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  The Grangegorman campus will bring together all of DIT on one site from our six current locations and 30 individual buildings.  Today, there are 1,200 students and 200 staff in Grangegorman.  By September 2019, this number will increase to 10,000 students and 600 staff.  The campus is also a major contributor to regeneration that will bring this quarter of the city in line with other parts of Dublin.  The new technological university will have three physical campuses &ndash; at Grangegorman, Blanchardstown and Tallaght &ndash; underpinned by a digital campus that will provide our students with online learning resources.  Building on our shared strengths, the new institution will have 28,000 students across our full range of disciplines.<\/p> <p>  These twin priorities, in line with Government decisions for higher education, are the focus for the DIT strategic plan to be delivered for our students and for the greater Dublin region.  We  acknowledge the support of the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority and successive Governments who have worked with us.  We have also had tremendous support from our industry and community partners and university partners in Ireland and abroad.  Here in Dublin, the support of Dublin City Council and Dublin Chamber of Commerce has been invaluable.  The challenging economic environment over recent years has impacted very significantly on higher education as a whole.  However, my colleagues, our students, our graduates and our partners are ambitious for us to succeed in what we have set out to achieve and we hope to see significant progress in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement and I hope we can answer all the questions satisfactorily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian Norton"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":603,"content":"<p>The witness is very welcome.

In terms of copyright agreements, there are then agreements in terms of what constitutes fair use of copies etc.  We pay to the agencies that supervise that area a fee to enable provision of copies free of charge.  The model is right.  The business of publishers is essentially to take in input provided by researchers.  As the Deputy indicated researchers do need to place their work in the journals because there is no point doing research unless it is communicated.  Publishers make their money by selling that research to other libraries.  The material generated within an institution is still available within that institution but the Deputy is correct in terms of what she said regarding access to information elsewhere.  That is a universal global issue.

Obviously the majority are not aware of this scheme and we need to ensure that the way the funding is being passed through the HEA to the relevant colleges for these courses is transparent and that it is obvious what it is being used for.  Second, in the higher education field, we need to ensure that if expertise in these specialist fields is required, we are moving towards being able to do it ourselves.  What is being done to ensure that happens?  Frankly, we will have single points of failure all over the place regarding the requirements for such programmes which we obviously have if there are 600 students.  We need to see if there is a plan or a strategy to gradually move towards that through the HEA.  I would like to see an obvious sign of that graduating from the beginning of where these programmes are signed off.<\/p> <p>  I want to see every single programme across every single college and to see what the HEA and others have done to make sure this will change gradually and we will be moving to a point in each programme whereby we will no longer have to do this.  Surely there has been massive progress in this regard, particularly for the programmes that started some years ago.  I am sure this will become obvious when this documentation is sent to us.  I am glad I raised this point.<\/p> <p>  The final issue in regard to general procurement is that the cost of &euro;5.1 million at 11.4% is a very significant figure.  It obviously cannot continue.

DIT was very fortunate in that we obtained the largest number, approximately 250 students, but tied to that was the fact that we had to provide accommodation and English language tuition for those students.  It was part of the package.  At a very late stage in the year we found we had a large contingent of Brazilian students coming to DIT and we had to respond.

In that year, the university recognised income totalling &euro;269 million and realised an overall surplus of nearly &euro;2.8 million.  Academic fees, totalling over &euro;101 million, represented the university's largest category of income &ndash; nearly &euro;37 million of that figure was received directly from the HEA.  As is evident from the graphic in the presentation on the screen, in addition, recurrent State grant funding totalled &euro;46 million, and State funding for pensions amounting to &euro;44 million was also recognised.  Grants in support of the university&rsquo;s research activity totalled &euro;53 million.  The university&rsquo;s total expenditure in 2013 to 14 was &euro;266 million, with pay and pensions accounting for more than two thirds of that figure.  A detailed analysis of the university's operating expenses, totalling nearly &euro;70 million, is provided in note 7 of the accounts.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s audit opinion in respect of the financial statements was unqualified.  However, a number of matters were raised in his audit report.  These include a standard note for the university sector on the reasoning behind the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset and the committee will recall that the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined the background to that issue in his opening comments during the meeting with the HEA last week.<\/p> <p>  The university&rsquo;s statement of accounting policies notes that the results of Galway University Foundation Limited have not been consolidated with those of the university group, on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the university.  The foundation&rsquo;s main purpose is to engage in fund-raising activities for the purposes of the furtherance of education and research carried out by the university.  The financial statements recognise an amount of &euro;17.5 million due from the foundation to the university at 30 September 2014 in respect of capital projects that were completed in 2011.  The audit report also draws attention to the fact that the foundation had net assets of nearly &euro;58 million at the end June 2014, which indicates further substantial funding expected to become available to the university.<\/p><p>The audit certificate also draws attention to instances of procurement non-compliance noted in the course of audit, with payments totalling just over &euro;1 million made by the university to eight suppliers during 2013-14 in respect of goods and services that were not subject to competitive public procurement. <\/p><p> The recent special report on financial reporting in the public sector identified NUI Galway as one of two universities that had not completed their financial reporting for either 2012-13 or 2013-14 by the end of 2015.  The audits for both of those years have since been certified - in April 2016 and November 2016, respectively.  While some progress has been made in bringing the timeline forward on the 2014-15 audit for NUI Galway, it is the least advanced audit in the university sector for that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#JJ00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Drinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Drinan and call on Dr. James Browne to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#KK00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491465600,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I should introduce my colleague, Mr. John Gill, who is joining us.

I will give a very short presentation initially and then we will take questions as they arise.  I thank members for the opportunity to discuss the 2013-14 financial statements.  I am here in my capacity as president of the university and chief financial officer.  My colleagues have been introduced so I will not introduce them again.<\/p> <p>  In general, I believe NUI Galway has made very significant progress in recent years.  We have been enabled to become leaders and to welcome leaders in teaching and research from all over the world.  NUI Galway has continued to rise in the world recognised rankings, QS and Times Higher Education and is now ranked in the top 2% of universities in the world.  We are also recognised in the top 200 most international universities in the world.  I believe that is a significant achievement in the last number of years of austerity in the country and the third level sector. <\/p> <p>  Our research is recognised internationally, with significant success in recent times, particularly in acquiring EU funding where we are national leaders in terms of our ability to attract funding from the European Union Horizon programme.  We are committed to being a top-ranked and research-led university and our students and graduates want and deserve no less. <\/p> <p>  Like other Irish universities, NUI Galway has faced many challenges, with increased numbers of students, lower staff numbers, changes in funding models and overall reductions in support available to the university.  On funding, the sector and NUI Galway welcome the recommendations of the Cassells group on higher education funding.  Those recommendations are being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills and we welcome that.  We understand that there are challenges involved in implementing these recommendations.  However, we are acutely aware that they now need to be addressed and we wish to impress on the committee the importance of addressing that issue in due course. <\/p> <p>  However, today's business, the financial accounts of 2013-14, is somewhat different and we are here to provide the committee with material to address concerns it has raised, specifically regarding three issues, namely, the relationship with Galway University Foundation, non-compliance with procurement and the delay in production of accounts.  I will take members through each of these very briefly.  The details are in the submission.  <\/p> <p>  The mission of Galway University Foundation is to advance the strategic priorities and academic objectives of NUI Galway.  Its primary function is to generate financial support for our programmes and activities and it plays a vital part in the university's development.  The foundation does not receive funding from the university or the State for its fundraising activities.  The expansion of our campus in recent years by 40% in terms of square meterage would not have been possible without the foundation's support.  Let me be clear about that and acknowledge the tremendous support of private donors and of the foundation in helping the university to achieve its goals.  It is important to note that all the projects in question, which cost &euro;300 million, have been completed without any debt on the State or university.  That is in great measure due to the support of the foundation, which is able to leverage public money with and through private money.  The foundation is absolutely critical for the university and its future.  My experience would suggest that that is the case.<\/p> <p>  Turning to procurement, the university's policy is very clear.  We wish to encourage best practice, establish policy and procedures, provide training and advice, monitor compliance and co-ordinate procurement, both locally and in collaboration, where appropriate, with national partners.  In recent years, the university has devolved procurement activities and established what we term decentralised centres of excellence in procurement in the university in major areas such as buildings and estates, information systems and also library services.  This has been a significant success for the university.  We welcomed the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement and we certainly support its development.  The transition to this centralised national approach has not been without challenges and we respect that.  However, we acknowledge that significant progress has been made and we believe that the office is now working well with the university.<\/p> <p>  The third issue raised by the committee was the delay in the accounts.  Let me explain very briefly.  The university produces two formats of annual financial statements each year - the so-called HEA funding statements and GAAP format financial statements.  Both are audited by KPMG.  The GAAP accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The university adheres to long-established audit timelines.  In September 2013, the university undertook a detailed review of the appropriateness of its accounting treatment due to a highly technical issue.  This led to delays in the presentation of the financial statements to the university's governing authority.  This had knock-on effects on the provision of subsequent financial statements.  We can talk about the detail of that later on if members wish.<\/p> <p>  That is my opening statement.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I and my colleagues are very happy to provide further clarification, if necessary. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#KK00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Browne.  Before I call Deputy Catherine Connolly, the witnesses from the National University of Ireland Galway are the third group of witnesses to appear before the committee.  They were preceded by representatives from Waterford Institute of Technology and Dublin Institute of Technology.  The witnesses may have heard me express great displeasure at being presented with accounts covering the period 2013-14.  The committee takes the view that it is not acceptable for third level institutions to present accounts from such a long time ago.  Members were almost of the opinion this morning that the committee was wasting its time discussing such old accounts.  In any event, given the importance of the issues to be discussed, we proceeded with our deliberations.<\/p> <p>  As I indicated to the representatives of the other institutions, the committee is insisting that the financial accounts for the financial year ending in the summer of 2016 be completed by the end of June 2017 and be ready for audit on 1 July.  We are also asking that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General have the accounts audited before the committee resumes its meetings in September 2017.  We are asking third level institutions to have their accounts ready approximately 12 months after the end of the financial year, not within three, four or five months.  It is outrageous that accounts from two or three years ago are being presented to the committee.  We are not doing our duty in discussing issues dating back three or four years.  We also want the Department and the Higher Education Authority to insist that financial statements are presented in the manner we have proposed.  We do not understand how organisations can obtain funding in the annual Estimates process when they have not presented their accounts for the previous year or even two years.  Dr. Browne gets my point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#KK00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491465600,"counter":986,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#KK01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":987,"content":"<p>The institutions must provide whatever resources are necessary to achieve this.

The experience that I have had in the university in the past ten years or so - I have spent, I would say, 15 years on the foundation board - has been that donors like to deal with independent foundations.  One may well ask the question, why is that the case?  That is the case internationally and it is the case in this country.  I can give the committee, and I am happy to talk to the Comptroller and Auditor General, examples of individual donors who have done that.  In fact, on our reserves - that is the reason I mentioned that the reserves are not as big as they appear in the accounts - there is some money in that foundation which is for a third party, through a donor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#MM02800","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>What does that mean?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#MM02900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491465600,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>Just what it says, a third party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#MM03000","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>Sorry, I do not understand what that means.

My point is that foundations need to be at arm's length from the university in order to deal with donors and also, very importantly, to provide reassurance to donors that the purpose for which their donation is intended is being realised.  The foundation acts effectively as a guardian of the donor's funds.  The donor gives funds to the foundation in anticipation of funding a certain project or certain activity.  When the donor is satisfied that project is complete or that activity is under way, then the foundation, as guardian, releases those funds to the university.  The university, of course, goes ahead with the project in the expectation of donor funds being released.  That, to my mind, is best practice.  That, in my experience, is best practice in foundations.  That, to me, is why it is so important to separate the foundation from the university.  I think that is the reality of what happens around the world where foundation and philanthropy is well developed.  Philanthropy in Ireland is not well developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#MM03200","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I will interrupt the president there, if he does not mind, because I have a limited time to ask questions.

A meeting with the management team is then organised by my office and we work through a set of projects which I and the accounting team believe are in the interests of the university.  He then creates a basket of opportunities and solicits funds with his colleagues for those projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#NN04800","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1491465600,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>A basket of opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#NN04900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491465600,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>I missed the last comment.

Prior to that, the results had been more balanced and there had not been a cause for great concern.  When the result came out, the university was very concerned, as it should be, and it brought in experts to look at the promotion process, who revised it completely.  The next scheme was not until 2013-14 as there had been a ban on promotions in universities brought about by the austerity measures.  The processes in this round were very different.  The same basic principles applied, such as academic peer reviews by colleagues and rankings on the basis of academic output, but there were a number of important differences arising from the advice of gender experts.

That is not to say it is rampant or evident in every charity but we should not suggest that because we have sufficient levels of oversight in the charity sector we should be satisfied.  I am not satisfied.  While there is no public funding, as Dr. Browne put it, because it is funding that comes from individuals, where there is a very close synergy and where money is transferred from a foundation to an institution, there is a need for a re-examination of the current structures.

We were the first university in the country to have incubator units, going back to 1973.  With the support of what was then the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, IIRS, the university then created an incubator unit on the campus.  We are very proud of that.<\/p> <p>  The university has significant research activity, funded primarily by third parties, including State third parties.  That activity creates intellectual property.  The university has policies with regard to the exploitation of that intellectual property.  It has policies with regard to conflict of interests and all or any conflicts arising from intellectual property.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the exploitation of IP, the university incurs the cost of patenting intellectual property with the support of Enterprise Ireland.  Exploitation can arise in a number of ways.  One way is where a company, an external organisation, decides it wishes to purchase IP from the university.  If that happens, the proceeds are shared within the university.  We have a table which shows the precise break-out of those shares, which I can pass to the Deputy if he is interested.  The money is shared between the university centrally, the school to which the individual belongs, and the individual who acquired the IP.  That is all set out in our procedures.  That is one way of exploiting it.<\/p> <p>  A second possibility is that an individual in the university who has created intellectual property which has been patented may wish to exploit it through a start-up company.  The university supports that, with the support of Enterprise Ireland generally or with the support of other similar organisations, and the university takes a share in the company.  The individual will also have a share in the company, which then proceeds to do its business.  The reality is that, over time, the university's share is diluted as further investments go in.

We had a discussion earlier about an independent or external examination or review of one institute.  We have just heard from another higher education president who has given his view on the matter.  He used the word \"unacceptable\".  I have been raising very similar concerns and I need to know before I leave here today that the concerns I have raised, which are genuine, reasonable and are in the best interests of all institutions, will be addressed.<\/p> <p>  If nothing else comes of this, we must at least tighten up on the relationship between people in management and governance roles and spin-out companies.  However, we cannot just examine whether there was compliance with rules within an institute.  There must also be a thorough examination of the differences and variations between the institutes.  We must examine whether it is appropriate for heads of research and presidents of institutes to have shareholdings in companies in which they have an obvious role and where everyone accepts there is a conflict and whether it is possible to manage those conflicts.  In that context, I have concerns.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Love has expressed his view but it does not tally with my world view.  I want be sure that the external review will have very strong terms of reference and will examine all of these issues.  The review cannot just focus on whether a policy was adhered to but also on whether the policy itself is appropriate.  It must assess whether there is sufficient arms-length separation between people who hold very senior posts in educational institutions and people who have a connection with spin-out companies.  That is very important but I am not sure, from what I have heard this morning, that the external review is the best possible way to do that.  I fear that it could be a desktop examination of somebody else's work, which is not appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017040600002#RR04100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1491465600,"counter":1431,"content":"<p>We only got the request for an external review yesterday so we have not had a chance to define the terms of reference yet.

In terms of where it originated, we have many different items of legislation - electoral Acts and local authority Acts - in this area and we are looking to come up with a single definition of &quot;donation&quot; in this Bill.

However, this does not cover a donation to a member of a local authority.

Subsection (1) defines the seven forms of interest that are declarable interests for the purposes of this legislation.  They are laid out in subsection (1)(a) through to subsection (1)(g).  They are an income, a contract, an office, an asset, gifts and travel accommodation, property that could be supplied or lent and interests of a residual nature.

If he or she is no longer a public official, this is not required but he or she may still be subject to other parts of the Bill, such as in respect of land.

I am in favour of doing this but it would be a matter for the standards commissioner.

I am not proposing any amendment that might get in the way of the latter but I can reflect on the word \"means\" and on whether it might get in the way in the future.  That is not my intention.  It is particularly not my intention for people who are newly elected to the Oireachtas.  It is entirely possible that a person could have a professional business outside public life and have a matter they are in the process of resolving with the Revenue Commissioners.

Subsection (1) provides for the issuing of advice by the commissioner to a person to whom the Act applies regarding steps that could be taken by the person to comply with the Act.  Subsection (2) provides that when a request for advice is made, the relevant provision of this Act will not apply between the time the request is made and the time the commissioner gives or declines to give that advice.  Subsection (3) provides that the commissioner may issue confidential advice and guidance where he or she considers it appropriate to do so.  Subsection (4) provides that in any proceeding or investigation of a breach, regard will be given to whether a person complied with the advice furnished, but regard will only be had to the compliance with advice in respect of determining the sentence of the individual concerned.  Subsection (5) provides that subsection (4) applies to advice or guidance confidentially under subsection (3), despite its confidential nature.<\/p> <p>  I will restate this in plain language.  This goes to some of the questions put to me earlier regarding the application of the Act.  If a public official has a question on how a provision of the Act is being implemented, the official can go to the commission and ask for advice if he or she has a concern.

I am proposing amendment No. 25 to ensure that the new standards commissioner will be required to consult relevant stakeholders before drafting the model code of conduct for the guidance of public officials with regard to compliance with the provisions of the Bill, as required under this section.<\/p><p>Questions were put to me earlier in respect of ensuring that people who could be affected by the implementation of this code would be aware of it and would have an opportunity to input or to have their views known.  We are going to put that on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 26 relates to section 30(2).  The purpose is to allow public bodies the flexibility to draw up and issue codes of conduct which, while taking into account the model code that will be issued by the new standards commissioner, are specifically relevant to the particular public body concerned.<\/p><p>Officials will be covered by this Act.  Certain officials might have a particular role that requires a particular code of conduct.  The purpose of the Act is not to provide a code of conduct for every job in the public service.  It is to provide a relevant robust footing to issues raised by the Mahon tribunal.  It is then up to other bodies to make the necessary provisions.  If other bodies need to draw up a code of conduct that takes account of the requirements, they will be able to do so.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 27 is next.  It would not be practical for each Department to draw up its own separate code.  It is sensible that there is an appointed body to draft such a code for Members and for members of the Government.  The purpose of the amendment is to include a new subsection in section 30 that would make it explicit that sectoral codes would be drawn up based on the model code.  Moreover, any public body not covered by these sectoral codes will draw up its own code.  For example, we propose that my Department would draw up a code for civil servants, including special advisers.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government would draw up the relevant code for local authorities and elected members of local authorities.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 28 provides for a technical change to the Bill to take account of the nature and status of Oireachtas committees.  This is because it would not be appropriate for the new standards commissioner to give a direction to an Oireachtas committee.  The relevant power has been removed by this amendment.  Among other things, Article 15.10 of the Constitution provides that each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with the power to attach penalties for the infringements.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 29 deals with a technical issue.  The provision is to ensure that a procedure is in place for the new standards commissioner and for public bodies to amend or revoke codes of conduct and to issue replacement codes of conduct.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 30 is another technical change to section 30 to ensure that the obligation to consult stakeholders also relates to where a new replacement code is drawn up by the new

It lays out that a public official \"shall not accept gifts from the same person, the value of which, in aggregate, exceed &euro;600 over the period of a year\".  Section 11 (4) states, \"Where a gift the value of which exceeds &euro;600 is given to a public official, then, unless the gift is unconnected with the performance of the official&rsquo;s functions, he or she shall, within 14 days [do the following]\".  I would see all of this in the light of the fact that we are talking about something that has to exceed &euro;600 in value.

As a result, I have tabled these amendments, which are all related, in order to deal with the issue.<\/p><p>These revisions operate on the basis that there will be no hearing or interviews under oath in the course of an investigation but that there will still be the possibility of an oral hearing before the commissioner.  The distinction is that where a breach is such that a prosecution for an offence is anticipated, the breach can be processed, through the investigation procedure provided for in Chapter 3, to a prosecution without any hearing taking place.  As no hearing would take place, there is no possibility of prejudicing a subsequent prosecution.  If a breach is such that an administrative sanction only - rather than a prosecution - is anticipated, the commissioner can hold an oral hearing without the fear of any subsequent prosecution being tainted.<\/p><p>To express this in a different way, a fundamental rule in criminal law is that which relates to self-incrimination.  This rules stipulates that an accused cannot be compelled to provide evidence of information against himself or herself which could then be used against him or her in a criminal prosecution.  The only circumstances in which that could happen would be in respect of a criminal trial.<\/p><p>Let us say a suspicion is formed about a criminal offence being committed.

The breadth of what is required would mean that the person who is the subject of the inquiry would have to be informed of what is underway at the preliminary stage.

It should be entirely open to the commissioner to say that he or she has received a statement - that for example lays out an asset - and the commissioner has reason to believe that the statement is not accurate.

The first thing is reputational damage.  One could be completely innocent.  Again, it is a question of striking the balance we are talking about.  We are arming an agency of the State with significant powers and money to carry out an investigation.  With regard to the preliminary part of this and the opening of the formal investigation, it is very important that there be a completely level playing field in order that, if another investigation is undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it will at least know it found something wrong.

In response to Deputy Calleary earlier, I committed to writing to local authority representative bodies, for example, to notify them of what is currently before the Oireachtas, which we will do.  However, we are debating a point of principle, namely, whether this body should have the ability to initiate an investigation if it believes it is warranted.  If the commissioner believes that a matter has been declared, or not declared, he or she has a concern about it, and he or she alone is in possession of that information, should the commissioner have the ability to do something about it?  I believe the answer to that question has to be \"yes\" because if not, we will be back to all of this being driven by the kind of impulse we have currently, much of which is reactive.<\/p> <p>  We can consider before Report Stage Deputy D'Arcy's concern to make sure we do not get to a point where there is the potential for a wave of unnecessary investigations being carried out.

The separate point is a point of principle which Deputy D'Arcy is raising legitimately.  I accept Deputy D'Arcy's need to raise it.
