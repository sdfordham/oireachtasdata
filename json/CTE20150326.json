The Secretary General is giving us the annual operating cost for 2015.  These are 20 year contracts.

I had specifically asked that the information be provided to us even on a local authority basis to avoid that kind of problem.  The Secretary General could have been more helpful.  He was well able to give us the operating cost based on the 115 contracts <i>in situ<\/i>, broken down by region, the south, the east, the north west and the total.  All I am asking for is the total cost of those 115 contracts.  I do not need to know about the individual contracts for wastewater treatment plants in Ringsend, Portlaoise, Mullingar or Roscrea.

We have indicated to the HSE that because of the number of items on the agenda the meeting may last a full day.  <br\/><br\/>No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated Monday, 23 February 2015, from Mr. Seamus Carroll regarding moneys owed for works carried out at Ennis General Hospital.  The committee has come across a number of these cases - Deputy Deasy referred to one such case - in relation to the payment of contractors and subcontractors.  This case involves Glenbeigh Construction which I understand is a firm that procures many public capital projects.  It appears that this small firm is losing out.  The State should not facilitate this.  The committee will again write to the HSE to ask it to review the case to see if steps could be taken which would result in the contractor being paid.  This is an issue across Departments where contracts are made available and something needs to be done to protect the small firms and individuals who end up doing this work in order that issue will not continue to arise.  The committee will write to the Department about it and will raise it again at next week's meeting.<br\/><br\/>No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated Tuesday, 3 March 2015, received from the HSE on the payment of allowances at St. James's Hospital.  The committee can discuss this issue next week with the HSE and will forward the correspondence to the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA to ensure salaries should not be paid to public servants for lecturing.  <br\/><br\/>No. 3B.3 is correspondence received from Ms Susan Gray, chairperson of PARC, the road safety group.  It concerns the recording of information by court clerks on drivers who are disqualified but who do not have their licences endorsed.  The correspondence is to be noted.  This matter was raised when we discussed the issue of penalty points.  We have made a recommendation which is being considered by the criminal justice working group, from which we should receive an update.

The committee has seen that there is no proper policy being pursued in the HSE on travel or entertainment.  It is clearly not good enough that F&Aacute;S should have taken it on itself to provide the same services for its members' spouses as it did for its members in certain categories.  The committee needs to look at the issue on a broader basis and write to all of the agencies involved requesting them to examine their practices to ensure they are in compliance with proper standard practices.  This issue comes up from time to time in the case of the HSE, F&Aacute;S and other agencies.  In the case of F&Aacute;S, there is a legacy issue, it pertains also during the years in a number of agencies.  As well as ensuring the committee has it finally sorted out, I suggest it write to all bodies in receipt of public funds and that are using taxpayers' money to fund their operations to ensure they are compliant and that they write back to confirm the practices in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#D00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I know that in 2008 and 2010 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took up this matter.

While that may be the response of the Department it certainly falls way short of what is required with regard to the response that the business people in that locality are asking for.  From looking at the different sites there the response falls far short of what a commercial operator might do in terms of the development of Howth.  There are lots of issues still to be dealt with and we can deal with these issues in the context of the report and raise the fact that there are many other issues at ports around the country of which we are aware.  Although it is in court now, the John Shine case is a typical example of how the State ignores the efforts of a businessman to conduct his business and at the same time to resolve issues.  It is no way to carry on a business, in my view.

The authority has a development remit and a planning role.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall previous hearings into the events surrounding the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg by a joint venture company, in which the authority was a partner.  The failure of the joint venture project resulted in significant losses for the authority, which contributed to very difficult financial challenges and gave rise to a major legal case against the authority.   Against this background, the Government announced its decision in May 2012 to dissolve the authority and transfer its planning and development functions to Dublin City Council.  Legislation will be required to give effect to this decision, and I understand this is being prepared.  The actual dissolution date has not yet been determined, and in the meantime, the authority has a transitional business plan in place to resolve the liabilities of the authority through the liquidation of assets, including the transfer of the relevant infrastructure, and to deal with any remaining litigation.<\/p> <p>  In 2013, the authority disposed of significant investment properties, resulting in a turnover of &euro;21 million, and reported an operating surplus of &euro;2.7 million for the year.  This compared to an operating deficit of &euro;5.7 million in 2012.<\/p> <p>  For 2013, the authority chose to change its accounting policy to show all fixed assets and certain investment assets that were previously held at nil value at their market value.  The 2012 comparatives have been restated to reflect the effect of the change in accounting policy on the prior period.  As a result of this adjustment, the 2012 net assets increased by &euro;5.2 million to &euro;10.2 million.  The 2013 net assets of the authority amounted to &euro;15.2 million.<\/p> <p>  The authority&rsquo;s liabilities decreased from &euro;24.4 million at end 2012 to &euro;12.7 million at end 2013, and this was funded through the proceeds of the sale of investment assets.  The authority continued to sell its investment properties throughout 2014 in order to meet its outstanding liabilities.<\/p> <p>  The 2013 financial statements were certified on the 23 December 2014, and a clear audit opinion was given.  However, on page 16 the audit certificate drew attention to the executive board&rsquo;s compliance statement, which discloses that the authority did not comply with public procurement guidelines in a number of instances.  My office is awaiting draft financial statements for 2014 from the authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I am the acting chief executive of the authority.  I was appointed in March 2014 and I am on secondment from Dublin City Council.  I work with the authority two days per week.  I am joined by my colleague Mr. John Crawley, the authority&rsquo;s financial adviser.  We are here to discuss the 2013 annual report and financial statements and to bring the committee up to date on developments in the authority since we last appeared in February 2014.<\/p> <p>  Last week we submitted a briefing document to the committee, to which we will refer to this morning.  This briefing covers an update on the recommendations in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 77, some details on the authority&rsquo;s financial position, and a report on the future development of the docklands.<\/p> <p>  On 31 May 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to dissolve the authority.<\/p><p>A new council and executive board were appointed in June 2012 to the authority to oversee the transition.   The Minister envisaged that the authority would remain in place for a transitional period.  During that period the authority is required to wind up existing operations, prepare the transition to new arrangements and make recommendations to the Minister on appropriate structures for the future.  These structures should ensure the following: the docklands brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment; that high-value development is maintained and enhanced; that an appropriate fast-track planning regime remains in place; that the local community and the business sector continue to be involved in the regeneration project; and that job creation is facilitated. <\/p><p> In addition, the board has also considered and made recommendations to the Government on how best to achieve the Minister&rsquo;s key objectives for the future regeneration of the docklands in a way that the board considers will build on the positive elements of the authority&rsquo;s legacy in terms of social, physical and economic regeneration.  In this regard, following the Government's decision to wind up the authority but to retain an appropriate fast-track planning framework to complete the docklands project, a strategic development zone designation, SDZ, was proposed by the authority and Dublin City Council.  The Minister designated the city council as the development agency. On 16 May 2014 the SDZ was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is now effective and operational.  Until such time as the authority is dissolved it continues to operate its section 25 planning function alongside the SDZ planning scheme. <\/p><p> The authority&rsquo;s board, executive and council have proposed the creation of a forum under the auspices of the city council to assist it in the regeneration of the docklands area.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht has considered the issue of the wind-up of the authority and in its recently published list of 16 recommendations is supportive of the creation of a consultative forum which we understand will be established on a statutory footing.  The authority has worked with the city council on the best operational model to be used going forward.  A docklands unit has now been established within the city council and is based in the authority&rsquo;s offices in Custom House Quay, ensuring that there continues to be a physical presence in the area to oversee the continued regeneration of the docklands. <\/p><p> A series of key objectives and associated risks were identified to implement the Government decision, as reported on in the 2013 annual statements and these are being addressed and resolved, where possible, in advance of dissolution.  As regards the current status of the authority, the legal mechanism for the wind-up is through a dissolution Act.  The authority has given significant input to the Department on the dissolution Bill which we understand is expected to be dealt with in the Oireachtas legislative programme during the current session.  In terms of wind-up of existing activities, the authority followed two key strategies, namely, the sale of assets to deal with remaining liabilities, where feasible, and the transfer of infrastructure to Dublin City Council.  In light of what I understand are the complexities in drafting some aspects of the dissolution Bill provisions, a new board was put in place from 1 January 2015.  This board is made up of three members from the previous board and five senior executives from the city council. <\/p><p> In summary, since the successful resolution of the Donatex case and the issues surrounding the Irish Glass Bottle site, the finances of the authority have been stabilised from a negative position of nearly &euro;200 million to an expected positive closing position of some millions.  This should be seen in the context of a very challenging legal environment.  A new fast-track planning mechanism has been put in place to support the delivery of 2,600 housing units and up to 366,000 sq. m of commercial property, which in turn will create up to 23,000 new jobs.  In the past week the first planning permission under the new SDZ scheme was granted by Dublin City Council marking the beginning of a new phase in the regeneration of Dublin docklands.   A framework for the local communities' continued involvement in the future regeneration of the docklands has been agreed.  Regarding the mandate given by the Minister to wind up the authority, I am pleased to report the work is almost complete.  My colleague and I are happy to deal with the committee&rsquo;s queries to the best of our knowledge and ability. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Clegg","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Clegg.

We received a statement from a previous chair, Professor Niamh Brennan, on this matter.  Mr. Clegg mentioned the special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding No. 77.  Professor Brennan, to quote one section in summary of what she had to say about her term as chair from 2009 to 2012, wrote:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>I think it is a shame that the Dublin Docklands redevelopment project foundered on a single, high-risk, Irish Glass Bottle site throw of the dice, bringing the Docklands development authority from a cash-rich, successful organisation to the brink of insolvency and irretrievable reputational damage.  Irish taxpayers and the local Docklands community deserve better.<\/blockquote>I suppose she is not quite accurate once we go through No. 77, the special report and what Mr. Clegg has said himself in his own report, which he gave to us earlier.  It is clear that there is a total legacy of failure in the operation of the docklands authority from 1997 until roughly 2009.  There were issues of governance, financial matters and internal systems of financial control.  The board itself was not being informed about decisions that were taken; there was seemingly an internal cabal there.  There was a conflict of interests, with the CEO of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority going to Anglo Irish Bank straight from the docklands.<\/p><p>It seems as though the entire planning process was compromised by the development requirements with the result that, as Mr. Clegg says in his final remarks, the authority has now stabilised from a negative position of nearly &euro;200 million to a positive position.  Of course, the glass bottle site was the last throw of the dice and was a total disaster.  Could Mr. Clegg comment on that in the first instance?  What is his opinion on what happened with his predecessors in the job for a start, and on the operation of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority over a ten-year period or a little longer?

Two consultants were engaged because of their previous knowledge in 2013 without any tender process.  These contracts amounted to &euro;116,383.  A third contract amounted to &euro;501,106 in 2013 and was the subject of a restrictive competitive tender process.

The requirement for procuring a financial advisory service arose first in 2010 when the then finance director resigned.  There was an embargo on recruitment in the public service and the authority put out a tender for the provision of financial services.  This was done on three occasions, in May 2010, March 2013 and November 2014.  In each case, Crawley Business Consulting Limited was the successful candidate.<\/p> <p>  The procurement issue relating to March 2013 which is under review in our financial statements was that when the service was put in place, it was expected that the authority would be wound up eight months later.  The dissolution date at that time was November 2013 and any residual unfinished work would be carried over to the successor of the authority.  Due to circumstances beyond our control, the wind-up of the authority was delayed.  This was due to complications regarding significant planning matters.  In 2013, we were faced with the dissolution being extended to June 2014 and the board had to continue the orderly sale of assets and liabilities.  Had the wind-up taken place in November, these activities would have been carried out by the authority's successor. <\/p> <p>  During 2013, there was a greater workload on the authority.  This was when the authority was starting to dispose of its assets and vigorously working to collect moneys owing to it.  At the same time, the authority's staffing went from 15 down to four.  There was more work to be done, the authority was in wind-up mode and the staff were leaving.  Understandably, when staff knew the authority was to be wound up, they sought other jobs.  Therefore, given the short-term extension of the board, the financial services contract was not put out again to tender.  <\/p> <p>  When I came on board in March 2014, the deadline date for dissolution was June 2014 and we were working towards that date.  The wind-up did not take place in June 2014 and the dissolution date was extended to December 2014.  In August, I carried out a review of procurement compliance and put the service out to tender again.  I suppose what occurred is that the authority would have made the decision in 2014 that there would be a wind-up in November so it used a restricted procedure.  In hindsight, there is no doubt the better course of action would have been to go for an EU tender competition and we did that subsequently.  However, we need to look at the context at the time the decision was made in 2013.  The wind-up was to be in November, staff were leaving and there was additional work.  Also, the authority was operating in a complex legal environment.  It defended a &pound;100 million claim, the bankers were going to call in loans, it looked as if its overdraft facility would be withdrawn and it had to negotiate a new overdraft and it had to deal with the complexity of selling assets within the docklands.  This was a complex work environment.

The Deputy referred to three tenders in his question.  One of the other two tenders related to VAT consulting services.  When we commenced the asset disposal programme in mid 2012, we reverted to the previous tax advisors who advised us, on the basis of the authority's records, when we acquired those assets.  In other words, the assets had been acquired over a period of time and we reverted to the previous tax advisors as we did not have in-house VAT experience.  When we went to the tax advisors we had previously procured, we discovered that a key person involved in the advice who had the particular corporate knowledge had left the organisation and set up her own business.<\/p> <p>  We followed the trail to her business.  At the time, we took the view that there were good technical reasons as to why we would operate that contract to a single economic operator.  We acknowledge that best practice was not followed by not putting it out to open tender.  However, we felt there was critical knowledge available and given the short timeframe we had available to sell the assets, we engaged the services of that person.  That person has been engaged to see out the remaining work.  There are no further instructions to be given to that person at this time.  In the event something new arises that is not particular to the past, we have now accessed the DCC tender panel where we can procure VAT services.<\/p> <p>  We had a second contract in regard to ducting networks which had been installed in the authority over the period 2000 to 2008.  A firm was procured for that piece of work.  In or around the time of the economic collapse, the authority put all expenditure on hold, including expenditure on the ducting network.  Unfortunately, the ducting network fell into some financial and operational disrepair as a result.  When I came on board, we took up that issue and reverted to the people who had been running the contract previously and asked them to finish out a piece of work.  We did not put that out to tender at that point because we felt they had the specific corporate knowledge.  Frankly, we did not have the records ourselves to be able to do the work.  Subsequently, when we got it under control, we put it out to tender and it is currently on a short-term tender, pending a strategic decision in conjunction with the SDZ as to what we want to do with ducting networking in the future.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we accept we did not follow best practice, but we were in a particular set of circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Crawley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Has Mr. Crawley any comment to make on his own case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#H01000","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I was the recipient of that contract, which I tendered for three times over the period in question.

While the authority was an operating authority it accounted for the liability on its own balance sheet.  That is not the norm in the public sector.  Normally in the public sector, pensions are accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The liability is still in the order of &euro;8 million.  On the wind-up of the authority, we started to close out issues of liability, among which were pensions and balance sheet adjustments, which I will refer to  later.  We asked the Department for guidance and it was agreed that pension scheme obligations would be taken over by the State.  Ultimately the decision as to where that is to rest remains outstanding but because it was to be taken over by the State we were no longer going to account for it on our balance sheet and we thus wrote it back.  The State is currently carrying a future pension liability of approximately &euro;8 million, based on the valuation from 2013, which will have to be met at some point in time.  Separately, it appears that the asset position of the authority will be in the order of several millions of euro, possibly as high as &euro;9 million.  As we are a State agency under the auspices of the Department, those proceeds go back to the Department, which will make the decisions on how they should be dealt with in the future.  We are still working with the Department and Dublin City Council, which will take over many of the responsibilities of the authority, to decide exactly where those liabilities will be met and how the assets can be used to fund them.  Approximately &euro;1.1 million of the liability of &euro;8 million will arise in the next five years and a further &euro;1.2 million will arise over the following ten years.  This is because the staff working in the authority were relatively young and, therefore, their deferral dates are quite far into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Crawley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The Department's view is that the liability remains with the State and it is not unreasonable that the assets would be used to fund liabilities.

On the recommendation of the consultant we put fire marshals in place to ensure that a detection process is available in the event of any emergency and that people can be evacuated safely.  In working with the management company, we made sure that communication was entered into with residents.  A letter was sent from the management company to all owners and residents and Dublin Fire Brigade also sent a fire safety leaflet and a fact sheet outlining the key questions.  The next stage of work was the installation of fire alarms.  We have paid for the marshals and the fire alarms, and that work has just been completed.  Our immediate reaction was not to consider the liability issues but to make sure people were safe.  The main issue arising was a deficiency in the fire alarm system, which is in the process of being resolved.  We have put in place a good detection and evacuation process.  The next stage is to examine in detail the remaining deficiencies in each department.  This is a question of compartmentalisation, where fire proofing is done within individual units.

Have there been other deals since then, or are there any in the pipeline at the moment similar to that one?

I was always told that if one gives two excuses, then one does not believe the first one.  If Mr. Crawley says there were competing priorities at the time and that time was being left for people to come in on it, then he does not believe either of them.  The fact it took from the end of 2013 to 2015 to sign over on a deal that is way below market value is quite extraordinary.  Were there secret deals or are there any in the pipeline?

The authority was originally established as the Custom House Docks Development Authority in 1986 and it because the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 1997.  It has been in existence for well over a quarter of a century and its activities have left a very bad taste in the mouths of the members of local communities.  Sheriff Street lies cheek by jowl with the docklands development area, DDA.  There is 100% employment in that area, but in Sheriff Street there is an unemployment rate of over 60%.  The level of community gain has been very limited.  Some &euro;7 million was supposed to be spent on a school but that development never materialised and neither did the local employment charter and the 20% commitment attaching to it.  Can Mr. Clegg indicate how this is going to be rectified in the new strategic development zone?  Many developments occurred during the Celtic tiger period and there are now many iconic buildings, office blocks, etc., in the DDA.  The area is a very desirable location for companies that are seeking to establish operations in the city.  Nevertheless, development there has led to the creation of a ghetto-type situation.  The evidence of this is now more stark than ever, and something must be done in the context of the SDZ to eliminate the poverty and deprivation that exist cheek by jowl with enormous affluence and 100% employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#P02900","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>As I said in my opening statement in respect of the potential relating to the undeveloped lands, some 23,000 jobs could be created.  Just over 50 acres remain to be developed, and that is why we put in place the strategic development zone, SDZ.  We also have a fast-track planning process in place.  As I pointed out earlier, the first planning permission was granted by Dublin City Council on Friday last.  When one is going to create 23,000 jobs, the trick is how to ensure local employment.  We are going to include a clause in our planning permissions to encourage contractors and developers to work with the city council in order to ensure that we will maximise opportunities for local people.  As we all know, however, this is not enforceable contractually.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the local labour charter, which has been taken on board in the context of the Grangegorman strategic development zone.  The Dublin City Council office in the docklands is seeking to upgrade that local charter.<\/p><p>More importantly, we have engaged quite effectively with the local employment services in Amiens Street and Pearse Street.  We are trying to identify the industries that are coming to the Docklands so that if we know that in two or three years a particular industry will come, the local employment service can contact this industry with a view to establishing its employment needs.  If those employment needs can be catered for within the local employment service's records, good, but if not there is an opportunity to train people.  The local employment services are quite excited about this.  There is an opportunity here to get real, local jobs.  The people to use this are the local employment services.  They are the State bodies.  They are the experts.  We are working very closely with them right from the start.  I am optimistic about this, but local employment charters are not enforceable.

I welcome everyone to the 17th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.<\/p><p>During our sessions this week we are hearing from a number of witnesses on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead-in to the banking crisis 2002 to 2007 and any changes in approach after the crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. Michael Doorly, former finance director of Independent News and Media, and Mr. Gerry O'Regan, former editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  Specifically, Mr. Regan and Mr. Doorly have been invited to discuss the independence of editorial policy on the economy and property boom and, separately, their newspapers' business model and sources of revenue including that from the real estate sector in the period from 2002 to 2007.<\/p><p>Mr. Doorly is the company secretary of Independent News and Media plc.  He is an experienced senior executive in the group and has held a variety of senior management roles in the subsidiary Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Limited, including that of sales and marketing director, finance director and operations director.  He has also travelled extensively with the group to New Zealand, South Africa and the UK.  Mr. Gerry O'Regan was editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>for seven years from 2005 to 2012.  Prior to that he was editor of <i>The Herald<\/i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>for periods of six years and five years respectively.  Before that he was deputy editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and held various other editorial positions on the newspaper.  Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan are welcome before the inquiry.<\/p><p>Before I begin I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  In whatever sequence they wish, I invite Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan to make their opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#A00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427328000,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us.  As the Chairman outlined, I was editor of the<i>Irish Independent<\/i>for a period of seven years from 2005 to 2012, and I was previously editor of <i>The Herald<\/i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>for a total of 11 years.<br\/><br\/>I am qualified to discuss the editorial policy of the newspaper during my period as editor, rather than matters such as advertising revenue streams.  The established policy and practice of strict separation of the editorial and advertising functions meant I was solely responsible for editorial direction.  Under line management systems, other executives were accountable for commercial activities such as advertising.  Correspondence on behalf of the committee states it wishes to specifically discuss &quot;editorial policy on the economy and the property boom (2002-2007)&quot;.<\/p><p>By way of background and context, I think it should be noted that the overall role of an independent media in a free society is both complicated and nuanced, depending on events and circumstances.  However, my essential point in relation to editorial policy, particularly with regard to economic coverage, is that there was no conscious attempt on my part, or on the part of the newspaper, to fuel what has been described as the property boom.  It would be wrong, I think, to retrospectively arrive at definitive conclusions regarding the coverage of the economy and the property market on the basis of subsequent events and evidence which was not then but is now in the public domain.<br\/><br\/>The ever-changing dynamic which is a mass-selling daily newspaper requires sophisticated analysis when it comes to assessing editorial coverage on a particular issue.  As the biggest-selling daily newspaper in the country, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>has a wide and multilayered readership base.  These demographics, by definition, continue to evolve.  The primary objective of an editor is to try to cater for such readership requirements by marrying statistical data and social trends with editorial instinct.  The roadmap for editing, therefore, by definition, remains constantly subject to change, depending on changing events.<br\/><br\/>Coverage of the economy and related matters, such as the property market, is a key part of the journalistic remit of a paper like the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  However, such coverage cannot be conducted in an intellectual vacuum, and editors, writers, contributors and analysts cannot but be influenced by the prevailing climate at a given point in time.  Certainly, up to and including 2007, the overwhelming consensus both domestically and abroad was that Ireland had transformed itself economically.  The country had by then enjoyed a number of years of unparalleled prosperity, manifest most of all in historically low unemployment rates and a period of net immigration for the first time in the history of the State.<br\/><br\/>It is important to give cognisance to the economic context and background in which media reporting and commentary we are now discussing took place.  It was obviously done within the parameters of knowledge at that particular point in time.  Certain objective data statistics and facts have to be taken into account when we look back at the period we are now reassessing.  The facts show the economy grew strongly from 2002 and this continued in 2007.  National debt was among the lowest in the developed world at 25% of GDP.  The country's fiscal performance was outstanding and employment levels were at heights never seen before in Ireland.  All of these factors led to a powerful so-called &quot;national feel-good factor''.  Ongoing reporting and analysis of economic and related matters continued against this background.  Central to some of the arguments being considered by the committee is that editorial work had to be carried out within the framework of known events and facts at that particular time.<br\/><br\/>The overwhelming consensus was that, despite the rapid growth of the construction industry and the ongoing rise in house prices, the essential pillars of our economy were sound.  The prevailing wisdom was that if a property bubble was to emerge, the country's still high employment figures and positive Government finances would mitigate against a serious economic downturn.  Hence the widespread belief in the financial, economic and political communities that a ''soft landing'' would result from the rapid expansion of the property and construction sectors over the previous number of years.  It is important to note also that this was the prevailing economic consensus abroad, particularly at EU level, and the approach to Irish fiscal and economic strategies by various reputable international organisations could be described as removed and benign, seemingly on the presumption that the fundamentals of our economy were sound.<br\/><br\/>As we now know, however, and as has so often happened in similar circumstances throughout economic history, underlying trends were gathering pace which would have serious negative implications for Ireland.  Clouds were gathering in the international financial world and the storm that erupted in 2008 led to a global financial crisis, which had profound economic and fiscal consequences for the economies of both the USA and Europe, and particularly for those on the periphery of things, such as Ireland.  In time, such developments would have profound consequences, particularly for our own banking structure.<br\/><br\/>The consequences for the Irish economy have been well documented, but for the period I have been asked to comment on, 2002 to 2007, the full import of a changing economic landscape worldwide was still in the future, and, as such, could not completely inform editorial coverage in the newspaper.  My predominant objective as editor was to optimise the circulation of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  By definition, in an intensely competitive environment, this meant embracing and encouraging wide-ranging and diverse views in its editorial content.  Daily newspapers articulate and reflect various dimensions of what has been described as &quot;the national conversation&quot; at any particular point in time.  Sometimes, of course, the predictions and assertions by some commentators about possible future trends may prove to be incorrect, but that really is intrinsic to the very essence of journalism, including economic forecasting.<br\/><br\/>The ultimate safety valve for the maintenance of editorial standards in a newspaper is the perception and understanding of its readers.  They can be influenced in making the ultimate choice, and it is a very grim choice for any editor - they can decide to stop buying the paper - if they believe certain editorial standards are not being met.  For all media, including newspapers, the consumer is the ultimate judge and jury.  For this and other reasons, which I hope will emerge in the discussion to follow, there was no hidden agenda in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>to try to artificially bolster the property market for the period under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Thank you.

During the period which is the subject of the committee's inquiry, I was finance director of Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited, which is the Irish subsidiary of Independent News and Media plc.  At the outset I would like to briefly address the subject of the role of the media from a commercial perspective.  It is generally accepted that one of the lynchpins of a democratic society is a free press which operates on an independent basis.  It follows that, in order to establish and maintain independence, media enterprises must be financially sustainable and capable of survival in a commercial and competitive environment.  In seeking to achieve this, the print media has two core sources of income: these are revenue from the sales of its publications and revenues from advertising.  Both income streams are vital and there is an interdependence between them.<\/p> <p>  The reality, of course, is that the publication is the core product which, through the quality of its content and its success in building circulation, sales and readership, creates a channel for advertisers to promote their goods and services.  Advertising revenues are, therefore, a factor of the reputation and integrity of a publication, which is built through good reporting and good journalism, and content that is relevant to its readership.  The requirement to maintain and build on this editorial integrity underpins Independent News and Media's policy of a strict and absolute separation of the editorial and commercial functions within the organisation.<\/p> <p>  The committee of inquiry has requested me to address a number of matters, including the company's business model and sources of revenue, including revenue from the real estate sector.  They have asked me to address the importance of property-related revenues within the overall revenue mix, the group's engagement in property-related commercial activity and the relationship between the editorial and sales functions.<\/p><p>The committee will understand that the company, as a commercial organisation operating in a highly competitive industry, is not in a position to disclose detailed financial figures that would be of potential benefit, and certainly of interest, to our competitors.  However, I will attempt to deal with the issues in a manner that provides the committee with substantive information which will meet its requirements.<br\/><br\/>Referring to the business model, Independent News and Media is the largest media operation on the island of Ireland.  It is also a public limited company.  The group has a strong portfolio of national, regional and local print titles, including the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, which is the market leader among the dailies, and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, Ireland&rsquo;s biggest-selling Sunday newspaper.  The production and distribution of newspapers is a complex operation, but in the business sense it is quite simple: we sell newspapers and we sell advertising.<br\/><br\/>Referring to sources of income, newspaper revenues are derived from two sources: circulation sales and advertising revenues.  Between 2002 and 2007 Ireland was a country in the throes of a major economic boom.  GDP grew strongly in each of those years and newspaper sales and advertising revenues enjoyed increases broadly in line with the economy.  Over the period, the revenues of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>increased by an average of 6.5% per annum.  This is a total of 37.6%.  I wish to correct the figure of 31.7% presented in my written submission.  Advertising revenues increased by an average of 9% per annum, or 52% over the period.  Circulation sales increased by an average of 3% per annum, or 17% during the period.  This is not surprising in an economy in which personal consumption was growing at an average rate of almost 5% a year.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the revenue mix, in 2002, 60% of overall revenues came from advertising, with the remaining 40% coming from circulation.  By 2007, 66% of overall revenues came from advertising, with 34% coming from circulation.  This movement is not insignificant, but neither could it be described as a paradigm shift.<br\/><br\/>Referring to the importance of property-related advertising in the overall revenue mix, it is clear that the demand for advertising space to promote housing developments increased throughout the period under review.  The increase was in line with the scale of activity in the residential property market, where house completions increased by an average of 13% per annum, from 57,695 units in 2002 to just over 93,000 units in 2006.<br\/><br\/>From a relatively low base, property-related revenues in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>grew by a similar 13% per annum, or a quantum of 89% over the period.  For reference purposes, it is worth noting that advertising of travel increased by 25% per annum throughout this period, or a quantum of 153%.  Revenues from property-related advertising represented an average of 14% of total advertising income and accounted for just over 9% of overall income - that is, income including both circulation sales and advertising revenues.<br\/><br\/>In his submission, my former colleague Gerry O'Regan gave an insight into the role of the media during the economic boom and subsequent crash.  The only comment I will add, specifically concerning the property market, is that the media, in my view, cannot create or sustain a boom.  Demand for property is created by a mix of factors over which the media have no control.  These include overall economic conditions, employment levels, consumer confidence, the availability of finance, demographics, the rate of home formation, and society's capacity for risk.<br\/><br\/>In relation to information sought concerning engagement in property-related commercial activity, I can advise the committee that INM did not engage in property development activities and was at no stage a participant in the property industry.  I would like to add, however, that as part of our normal operations the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>did relocate its printing business from Abbey Street in Dublin city centre to Citywest in Dublin 24 and relocated its publishing division to Talbot Street in Dublin 1 in 2004.  This was in line with other publishers in moving printing facilities out of what were congested city centre areas.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the relationship between the editorial and sales functions, Mr. O'Regan and I have outlined the position concerning the complete separation of the editorial and commercial functions within our organisation.  I thank the Chairman and I hope my comments are of assistance to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doorly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan for their opening statements.

The balance that the Chairman referred to is therefore weighted towards the newspaper, and this is the domain of the editor and is separate from the commercial functions.

I have an extract from the newspaper edition of 4 July 2007 when Brendan Keenan was responding to the statements made by Morgan Kelly.  He wrote in the context of an ESRI survey:<blockquote><br \/><br \/><font color=\"#111111\">Actually, there is a bigger danger; that the property market - rather than having a soft landing or a bumpy landing - crashes and burns.  This was the scenario outlined in the ESRI quarterly bulletin by UCD economist Morgan Kelly.<\/font><font color=\"#111111\">Although it was contained in the bulletin, it was not part of the ESRI forecast.  That predicts a soft landing, with house building falling 10pc over the 18 months, and house prices stabilising after a 3pc fall this year.  Prof Kelly takes a different view.  Based on property booms and busts in different countries over the past 40 years, an Irish crash could knock up to 60pc off the real (after inflation) price of houses over the next 10 years, he says.  The first thing to be said about Prof Kelly's scenario is that it\u00a0<\/font><i><font color=\"#111111\">could<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#111111\"> happen.<\/font><\/blockquote><font color=\"#111111\">In other words, it could lead to a massive property crash.  Brendan Keenan, as economics editor of the Irish Independent, continued, &quot;Anyone who says it is impossible is whistling past the graveyard, or a downright fibber.&quot;  I use that as a case in point that the paper was more than willing to embrace contrarian views.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":572,"content":"<p>What is the date of that article?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#D00400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427328000,"counter":573,"content":"<p>It was published on 4 July 2007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":574,"content":"<p>In 2011, <i>Vanity Fair<\/i>reported that Morgan Kelly had been turned down by the editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>who had said the article that was sent to him was offensive.

It would be as if the paper tomorrow carried economic predictions for the next year.  They will often vary in the context of the writer or economist who is making the judgment.

In terms of new media and some structural changes that were beginning to take place in the market, the group was developing a strategy of involving itself in developing websites in news, business and sport, but also classified advertising.

Among the awards was Irish investor of the year, Irish developer of the year, international property achievement, Irish commercial development of the year, Irish property personality of the year and residential development of the year.  Of those glittering awards, in 2007, the Irish property deal of the year was the Irish Glass Bottle site which cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions.  Seven of the award winners ended up in NAMA, five of whom were among the top ten debtors to Anglo Irish Bank, which cost the taxpayer billions of euro.

I welcome Ms Donovan and Ms Kennedy who have been invited to discuss <i>The Irish Times<\/i>' editorial policy on the economy and the property boom and, separately, the newspaper's business model and sources of revenue, including that from the real estate sector during that period.  Ms Donovan joined the newspaper from ICC Bank in 1977.  She held a number of senior management roles in the company before being appointed managing director of The Irish Times Trust Limited in 2007.  She retired in 2010.  She holds an MSc from Trinity College Dublin and has served as chairperson of NNI, the newspaper industry representative body.  She has been a director of the International Newspaper Marketing Association, INMA, and served in the European national newspaper group of the World Association of Newspapers.  She is also a director of the Children's Medical &amp;amp; Research Foundation, the fund-raising board for Crumlin hospital and the National Children's Research Centre.<\/p><p>Ms Kennedy was appointed editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in October 2002, the first woman to hold the post in the history of the newspaper, and retired in June 2011.  She has covered politics for <i>The Sunday Tribune<\/i>, <i>The Sunday Press<\/i>and<i>The Irish Times<\/i>for most of her career.  She was a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann between 1987 and 1989 when she served as spokesperson on foreign affairs and Northern Ireland for the Progressive Democrats Party and in the role of Chief Whip.  She was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the inaugural Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Tier.  As editor, she was awarded five honorary doctorates for her services to journalism by Queen's University Belfast, 2005; Dublin Institute of Technology, 2007; University College Dublin, 2008; Trinity College Dublin, 2009; and the University of Limerick, 2012.

I am speaking as the former editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  I retired in June 2011, having been appointed editor in October 2002.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, I was asked me to address the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007; the approach to reporting on the property market and the economy; and the contribution of the media to public understanding and debate around fiscal-budgetary policies and their implications.  I have also been asked to cover the business model and sources of revenue.  I will deal with that issue later.<br\/><br\/>I will be as helpful as I can in answering the committee's questions.  In the limited time given to me to prepare this submission I have been unable to review every single aspect of the newspaper&rsquo;s coverage in news, analysis, comment, opinion page, letters to the editor, etc.  I have been asked to account for coverage over six years - 52 weeks a year, six editions per week, adding up to 1,872 publication days.  It was impossible for me to read and review all of the material in every single issue of<i>The Irish Times<\/i>published in that period and I hope the committee will understand this.  Unfortunately, the archive does not easily facilitate such a detailed analysis.<br\/><br\/>By way of introduction, I should, first, provide some background on how <i>The Irish Times<\/i>operates since it may be helpful in our discussion.  Unlike most other newspapers, it is owned by a trust.  There are only a handful of newspapers owned by trusts in the world today.  The main object of The Irish Times Trust Ltd and the company which manages and operates the newspaper, The Irish Times Limited, is &quot;to publish The Irish Times as an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland free from any form of personal or of party political, commercial, religious or other control&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The memorandum and articles of association set out the policy principles of the newspaper: the support of constitutional democracy through governments fairly elected; the progressive achievement of social justice between people and the discouragement of discrimination of all kinds; the promotion of a society where the quality of life is enriched by the standards of its education, its art, its culture, and its recreational facilities, and where the quality of spirit is instinct with Christian values but free from all religious bias and discrimination; the promotion of peace and tolerance and opposition to all forms of violence and hatred so that each man may live in harmony with his neighbour [I presume they intended women to be involved also] considerate for his cultural, material and spiritual needs; and the promotion of understanding of other nations and peoples and a sympathetic concern for their well-being.<br\/><br\/>The objects of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>require that, in its journalism, news shall be as accurate and comprehensive as is practicable and be presented fairly; comment and opinion shall be informed and responsible, and shall be identifiable from fact; and that special consideration shall be given to the reasonable representation of minority interests and divergent views.  I have appended a copy of the memorandum and articles of association for the committee's perusal.<br\/><br\/>From the above, the committee can see that <i>The Irish Times<\/i>has an unusual structure where the managing director and the editor each report independently to the board.  It is designed to ensure the effective management of the newspaper&rsquo;s strategic and commercial functions and the independence of the editor, working within the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy.  There is a partnership of equals with different responsibilities.  It seems appropriate, therefore, that I address  section 1 of the committee's questions and the former managing director, Ms Maeve Donovan, section 2 because of our separate roles.<br\/><br\/>I was asked to address the context of the banking crisis.  Let me put the reporting of the economy and the property market in the context of some of the other major news events at home and abroad that we covered in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>between 2002 and 2007 because we were not single-mindedly looking at the property market or the state of the economy.  During that period there were two general elections; the invasion of Iraq; the introduction of the euro; changes in the leadership of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna F&aacute;il;  ten new members of the European Union; Mary McAleese&rsquo;s election as President; the deaths of Pope John Paul II, Liam Lawlor and Charles J. Haughey;  the historic meeting between Dr. Ian Paisley and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in Dublin, just to mention a few events.  There was also<i>The Irish Times<\/i>story in September 2006 that the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, was receiving moneys from businessmen while he was Minister for Finance, which was to lead to the newspaper&rsquo;s appearance before the Mahon tribunal and costly challenges in the High Court and the Supreme Court to establish the journalistic right to protect sources.  I have supplied an appendix giving more detail of the types of issue that would have preoccupied an editor at the time.<br\/><br\/>However, admittedly with the benefit of hindsight, the boom and bust in the economy were the major event that spanned all of these years and had most impact on the lives of the people.<\/p><p>Editorial policy, by definition, is found in the leaders that express the views of the newspaper as determined by, or on behalf of, the editor every day.  I was able in the limited time available to review the editorials and leaders published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>over the 1,872 editions that are the subject of this inquiry.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>wrote 289 leaders expressing editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007.  They were a major issue of concern in the editorial columns in those years.  There were 38 leading articles in 2002, 73 in 2003, 56 in 2004, 52 in 2005, 31 in 2006 and 39 in 2007.<br\/><br\/>I am taking a narrow view of what the committee means by the economy and the property boom.  Throughout those years, it is fair to say that the policy of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>was critical of both the establishment and operation of the Financial Regulator and IFSRA, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, believing they were not independent of the Central Bank.  The newspaper was concerned about the erosion of competitiveness and critical of benchmarking in the determination of public sector pay, cautious about the banks&rsquo; lending policies and the scale of the property market.  As an aside, the chairman of the board of The Irish Times Limited was the Financial Regulator between 2002 and 2008.  I have attached an appendix on editorial policy on the economy and the property boom.<br\/><br\/>From 2003 onwards, the newspaper was warning that trends in the mortgage market were a cause for concern.  This policy was consistently expressed in editorials in the following years.  By way of illustration, in 2006, the newspaper was calling on the Central Bank and the then Government to analyse the risks the property market posed to future financial stability in an article &ldquo;Rate change cause for moderation&rdquo; on 3 March.  In case I could be accused of being selective, I am presenting all editorials to the committee for its perusal.  I have also written a short summary of the policy positions relevant to the banking inquiry.<br\/><br\/>In their book, <i>The Fall of the Celtic Tiger: Ireland and the Euro Debt Crisis<\/i>, the authors Donal Donovan and Antoin E. Murphy identified four separate but related crises that resulted in the collapse of the Irish economy which required an international financial rescue.  These were, first, a property crash as the housing price bubble burst; second, a banking collapse where banks carrying too many non-performing property loans had their solvency questioned; third, fiscal failure as the economy contracted and tax revenue from property collapsed leading to the fourth crisis, sovereign debt.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>covered all four crises in detail as these stories unfolded in stages over the years to the best of its ability.  The coverage involved detailed news and analysis by reporters, specialist correspondents in the finance and business fields and the economic editors of that decade.  In effect, Simon Carswell became a full-time specialist in covering the banking crisis.  Extra resources and pagination were provided to the newspaper during this period.  In addition to reporting, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>commissioned articles about the banking crisis and the property market from specialists and noted academic economists.  Its opinion pages were the platform for divergent views and public debate that often set the agenda and contributed to the national debate.<br\/><br\/><i>The Irish Times<\/i>was the only newspaper to publish the article by Morgan Kelly, professor of economics in University College Dublin, predicting there would be a property crash with prices falling by between 40% and 60%.  The first article was carried on 28 December 2006.  Two others were carried subsequently.  Other noted contributors to the debate in the newspaper included the current Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, then professor in Trinity College Dublin, Professors Karl Whelan and Ray Kinsella, both University College Dublin, Brian Lucey, lecturer in finance, Trinity College Dublin, and Alan Ahearne, professor of economics, National University of Ireland, Galway.  He later became an adviser to the late Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Finance.<br\/><br\/>The same editorial standards applied in the property supplements as elsewhere in the newspaper.  There was no trade-off between editorial and advertising.  Advertising features were clearly signposted.  Advertisers did not write editorial copy.  We never carried advertorials in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  The newspaper had occasion late in 2007 to make a complaint to the professional bodies of auctioneers and valuers that some estate agents were providing the property supplement with misleading selling prices.  The newspaper took the view that if agents were unwilling to supply accurate information or if the vendors were reluctant to disclose the true selling price, then it would be damaging to the credibility of the newspaper to carry the results.  The introduction of the national property register in 2012 was a consequence of this discovery and disclosure in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>This review of editorial policy and the approach to reporting on the property boom in the run-up to the banking crisis proved to be an interesting exercise for me.  I was challenged to consider whether in my then role as editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>journalists could or should have foreseen the multifaceted nature of the financial crisis, including the property crash and the banking collapse.  I do not know what we could have done differently to put ourselves in the position to predict the magnitude of the fall.  We reported the news forensically.  We challenged the consensus and canvassed all views and published them.  The media, as always, were reliant on reporting the views of the specialists, be they Government, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator or the profession of economists.  Journalists were less well-placed than others to make an accurate assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kennedy.

As my colleague Geraldine Kennedy addressed the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy in the period in question, I will attempt to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions on the company, its business model, property-related commercial activity and the editorial-commercial relationship.<br\/><br\/><i>The Irish Times<\/i>newspaper is published by The Irish Times Limited and its controlling shareholder is The Irish Times Trust Limited.  The Irish Times Limited exists to publish <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It is prohibited from providing dividends to its shareholders.  Accordingly, all profits are retained in the company.  The Irish Times Trust Limited has certain powers under the memorandum and articles to appoint and remove directors of The Irish Times Limited, to call general meetings and the control of significant acquisitions and disposals.  The primary role of the trust is to appoint a board which it believes will ensure the company is well run and adheres to its core objects.  Thereafter, the trust leaves the board to get on with it.  The board has the responsibility of adhering to the main object concerning the quality and independence of <i>The Irish Times.<\/i>The trust acts a second guarantor or long stop, a responsibility grounded in the trust as a whole.<br\/><br\/>Editorial policy at <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is the responsibility of the board of The Irish Times Limited.  In practical terms, day-to-day policy is executed by the editor and team in the context of the memorandum and articles of the company.  The core requirement is trust, integrity and balance.  As managing director, I had no input into day to day editorial decisions.  The managing director is, however, responsible for the overall viability, performance and development of the business, including responsibility for strategy.<br\/><br\/>Regarding business model and sources of revenue 2002 to 2007, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>business model is a traditional one in the quality newspaper sector in Europe and elsewhere.  Newsgathering and all ancillary activities are funded by a combination of cover price and newspaper sales revenue, subscription revenue and advertising revenue, both print and digital.  During the inquiry&rsquo;s reference period, growing revenues derived from printing external publications.  The latter commenced in 2002 with the commissioning of the company&rsquo;s new printing plant at Citywest.  The ratio of advertising to circulation revenue was typically 60:40 on average.  This moved up and down depending on the state of the economy.  Key advertising sectors, particularly for quality newspaper titles, are property, recruitment, general classifieds including motors and display or run-of-paper advertising.<\/p><p>The classifieds include cars and small ads in various categories.  The run-of-paper advertising is largely about retail, food, financial services and so on.<br\/><br\/>During the reference period, the steady advance of digital media, and hence digital advertising, was a key strategic challenge for the company. This remains the case for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and indeed all print media, as the pace of digital adoption continues to increase.<br\/><br\/>On the importance of property-related revenues to the overall revenue mix, property is a key pillar of the newspaper&rsquo;s publishing revenue.  The commercial property supplement in Wednesday&rsquo;s newspaper and the residential property supplement on Thursday are important to readers as well as advertisers.  The readers of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>have a strong interest in both residential and commercial property.  They are buyers for both categories and many are also property investors.  In addition to the dedicated supplements, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>also provides extensive coverage on homes, interiors and related lifestyle content.  In an overall context, therefore, property is a key driver of readership both print and online for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  From an advertising perspective, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>'s audience is of particular interest to companies trading in the sector.  This has been the case for decades and certainly through my entire period at the newspaper.  The company&rsquo;s acknowledged success in the property advertising market has attracted new domestic and UK players into this market and into the sector.<br\/><br\/>When I came to work for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in 1977, it was the market leader in the property sector.  That position was maintained through the 1980s and 1990s, through the reference period, and it continues today.  Through the decades there have been new market entrants in both print and digital formats.  The market is highly competitive and highly diversified.  Globally, the long-standing success of newspapers in the pillar categories of property and recruitment is what gave rise, in large part, to the arrival of standalone digital websites and the resulting disruption of the newspaper&rsquo;s commercial model.<br\/><br\/>During the reference period, the company sought to balance increasing exposure to the property sector through a range of diverse activities.  The most notable of these was the development of strong external printing revenues from the Citywest plant.<br\/><br\/>The relationship between the editorial and commercial functions is clearly drawn in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Irish Times Trust.  It specifies that editorial content in the newspaper shall be &quot;free from any form of personal or party political, commercial religious or other sectional control&quot;.  That separation is carefully maintained under the stewardship of both the trust and the board.  This requirement of the company is deeply embedded in the company's culture.  It is heavily emphasised from the induction of new staff onwards, and it is fundamental to the way in which the company operates.<br\/><br\/>At a macro level, everybody in the organisation understands the importance of advertising to the enterprise.  At the micro level, all staff, both editorial and commercial, are aware of the necessity of maintaining the separation of editorial and commercial activities.  Customers of the business are also very much aware of this.  This does mean that clients do not sometimes complain, but the role of the business team, especially its management, is to act as a buffer between commercial interests and the producers of editorial content.  This practice is regarded within the company as a key asset, and the independence of the newspaper is emphatically stressed when the newspaper is marketed to clients.  It is one of the key differentiators of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>within the Irish newspaper sector.<br\/><br\/>On engagement in property-related commercial activity, during the reference period <i>The Irish Times<\/i>engaged in two notable transactions.  The first was the purchase of the website <i>myhome.ie<\/i>.  As early as the late 1990s, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>sought to secure its position in key markets as revenue started to migrate from print to digital media.  Standalone classified sites had started to proliferate, particularly in Europe and the USA.  Obtaining a market-leading property site in the sector became a key strategic objective for the company and, hence, for the management team.  Along the way, the company developed several digital iterations in the property sector.  We had <i>ireland.com\/property<\/i>, and owned the ireland.com portal at that time.  We also had <i>irishtimesproperty.com<\/i>and <i>nicemove.ie<\/i>.  Despite considerable investment and marketing activity, none of these sites proved to be viable competition for <i>myhome.ie<\/i>, which was the market leader and had grown exponentially from its launch in 2000.  Therefore, our company&rsquo;s intentions turned to growth by acquisition.  The <i>myhome.ie<\/i>business became available for sale in 2006.  The Irish Times Limited retained NCB as an adviser for the bidding process.  There was a competitive process with at least two other bidders involved.  The acquisition was unanimously approved by the board of The Irish Times Limited and the transaction was approved by the shareholder, the Irish Times Trust.  The website became part of the Irish Times Group and today it remains a key strategic asset of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and trades profitably.  <i>The Irish Times <\/i>has a strong position in both print and digital media in a sector which has substantial revenue streams, which will help to protect the title into the future.  Successfully making the migration from print to digital is essential to the survival of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and indeed to all print media.<br\/><br\/>The second transaction was the sale of the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street premises and the leasing of the Irish Times building in Tara Street from Dublin City Council.  During 2005 and 2006, the company had been examining changing work practices and creating an appropriate environment for a changing business.  Various options were examined, including extensive remodelling of its listed buildings in D&rsquo;Olier Street.  The cost of redevelopment was prohibitive and inevitably required compromising on the space requirements.  Therefore, the decision was made to seek modern accommodation within the city centre, proximate to key sites such as the D&aacute;il.  A suitable property was identified and the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street buildings were sold in 2007.  The company transferred operations to Liffey House in Tara Street, a facility which was much more suitable for the development of the newspaper and a range of digital business interests.  The price achieved, &euro;29.1 million, was considerably higher than the company had anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":981,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Donovan.

Maybe that is the case but if one looks back into recent history, is that not the case also with the child abuse crisis, the role of the Catholic Church, the Magdalen laundries, Letterfrack and everything?

First, as Geraldine has said, she would have had reservations and would have liked to have more money to spend on other things at the time.  However, her opposition was not to what was accepted as the problem, namely the migration from print to digital.  I will give the Deputy an earlier example that might illustrate this for him.  The job of the editor and the entire journalistic team is very much focused on the issues of today and the immediate future.  It is very different for the business.  If we go back to the end of the 1980s when The Irish Times introduced colour printing, we had a very eminent editor, Mr. Douglas Gageby.   At that time, despite the investment, Mr. Gageby said that there would not be colour on the front page of the newspaper until Ian Paisley cut the tape on the Border.  I can tell the Deputy that within months there was colour from one end to the other of the editorial pages.  It took time for him to be sold on the idea.  That is the issue with strategic decisions.

The editorial budget of The Irish Times was in or around the &euro;30 million mark for the nine years that I was there.  That is a huge editorial budget which enabled us to have a correspondent in London, Washington, Paris, Berlin, one in Moscow for a while and one in China.  We had two correspondents in Northern Ireland during that decade but there is only one there now.  That all costs an awful lot of money but it is part of the role of The Irish Times, which is to give an independent view of world events as a neutral country.  The Independent, our main competitor, has no foreign correspondent at all.  What one reads in that paper is British newspapers' views on things like the Iraq War, to which we sent reporters.

The starting premise for a discussion of RTE's editorial policy on any area of public interest is that there is no single expression of it.  RTE's output is based on a set of principles which are derived from its statutory obligations.  These principles form the framework for editorial decision-making, and there is an editorial structure in place to monitor, discuss and challenge the editorial selections being made to ensure these principles are adhered to.  In RTE News this translates into a very simple premise: inform the audience in the public interest.<\/p> <p>  The political scientist, Jean Blondel, in an essay written in honour of the late RTE broadcaster, Brian Farrell, calls the role to inform \"the noblest of tasks\" because it is the most difficult.  It requires the reporting of facts, sometimes the establishment of facts, their selection according to their importance and the presentation of them with related material to allow their meaning or significance to be understood.  Referring to a concept of a national consensus, Brian Farrell himself described it as a living, flexible and loose set of shared ways of looking and ordering experience, constantly adjusting to and affected by the changes that these experiences represent.  He agreed that the whole concept of a free press in a free society supposes that any established or emergent ideology should be constantly open to challenge and criticism.<\/p> <p>  This is the basis for judging how RTE and other media performed their functions in the period under scrutiny.  Did it live up to this responsibility to inform?  Did it strive to establish the important facts in the rapidly changing environment?  Did it provide vigilance and challenge to assist understanding?  It is my personal view that RTE performed its public service role well in the period under discussion.  Could we have done better?  Of course we could.<\/p> <p>  An expression of RTE&rsquo;s view of its obligations is found in its vision mission values statement: to inform and to connect with the lives of all the people and deliver the most trusted, independent Irish news service, accurate and impartial, for the connected age.  The Broadcasting Acts are explicit in their requirement of news to be &ldquo;reported and presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the broadcaster&rsquo;s own views\".  RTE's public service statement specifically requires it to remain independent of any vested interest.  RTE prepares an annual series of commitments based on these principles and strategic objectives.  It reports on these in its annual report.  This forms part of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's review of RTE activities.<\/p> <p>  To ensure the delivery of these basic principles RTE has developed a series of journalism guidelines.  In my written statement I have gone into detail on the structures which deliver and monitor content.  There is no single editorial vision when it comes to RTE content.  For news, story selection has a variety of editorial inputs throughout the day, particularly from the specialist correspondents.  For programmes, each unit makes its own independent selection of what to feature, often in competition with other RTE output.  This process is overseen by an editorial conference structure that in my experience allows, and often encourages, editorial debate and challenge.  It is a structure which operates in a legal and compliance framework, requiring it to be vigilant of its responsibilities and to respond to complaints, representations and legal challenge promptly.  It is a structure with clear lines of editorial responsibility.  I can only speak subjectively about how RTE performed during the period.<\/p><p>There has been little or no authoritative objective media analysis that I have seen that assists any other approach.<\/p><p> It is worth remembering that there is a vast amount of material in the regular news bulletins and other current affairs programmes.  The two main correspondents in news have nearly 2,000 reports logged to them in television alone for this period and \"Prime Time\" did 120 programmes from 2000 to 2008 on the subject matter of this inquiry, with a third of those on property.  I am also conscious of something highlighted by Peter Lunn in an interesting paper on decision making biases in the banking crisis.  It is called \"hindsight bias\" and is defined as a \"tendency to perceive an event as more predictable than it actually was, and to overestimate the degree to which we actually did predict it\".<\/p><p> Most of the key moments or statements we remember from the crisis period were probably seen or heard on RTE programming, from Charlie McCreevy's budget in 2002 with its supports for the property market to Brian Lenihan announcing the guarantee or Patrick Honohan confirming the bailout on \"Morning Ireland\".  Throughout this period, in RTE news we were just reporting what was happening.  That was our job.  We followed events as they happened and tried to ask the right questions about them.  We were also open to including in our coverage, and to give prominence to, what the inquiry is calling \"the contrarian view\".  Indeed, because of our questioning approach, mandated by the principles I outlined earlier, some of our coverage was classed as being contrarian.  Certainly, our economics editor would have been put in that category during the period by other media outlets.<\/p><p> We gave great prominence to the European Commission warning of 2001 and the Government's rejection of it.  Each of the ESRI reports outlined by Professor FitzGerald in his testimony that warned of the imbalance in the economy and the need to introduce counter-cyclical measures was covered by RTE.  We covered all Central Bank reports and reports on the Irish economy by the OECD and IMF.  There was extensive coverage of the continued rise in house prices, the change in lending policy, the construction boom and the relationship between bankers and developers.  From 2007, there was a particular focus on Anglo Irish Bank, which extended to all of the banks following the share price drama of St. Patrick's Day in 2008.  Each shift in Government economic policy received detailed scrutiny, including in the elections of 2002 and particularly 2007.<\/p><p> George Lee's documentary \"Boom\" in June 2006 was particularly significant, not just for his provocative statement on the death of the Celtic tiger but particularly for his analysis of personal indebtedness, the dependence of the economy on property-related Exchequer funding and employment, and the real possibility that there could be a property crash.  The analysis done for \"Boom\" informed George Lee's reporting from then on, and contributed to an alertness to these issues across our output.  Richard Curran's \"Future Shock\" programme in April 2007 was another key programme.  It was followed by a debate on \"Prime Time\" between Morgan Kelly and Jim Power on soft and hard landings and led to a period of sustained criticism of RTE, including a number of formal complaints.<\/p><p> There was a journalistic awareness that Anglo Irish Bank should be watched as a story from the initial share price wobble in 2007.  In January 2008, for example, there was some controversy about a story David Murphy ran about stockbrokers recommending that clients sell Anglo Irish Bank and AIB shares.  The Northern Rock crisis, with queues at the Dublin offices, brought an awareness that international turbulence could have implications for institutions here.<\/p><p> The collapse of Lehman Brothers saw a major shift in the story.  From then to the arrival of the troika, it was continuous coverage.  As well as the pressure to be accurate in our reporting and analysis, there was the added dimension that what we were reporting could impact on events, as there was an international focus on what was happening here.  An example of this was the concerns of the Minister for Finance about the impact of a \"Liveline\" programme which featured callers talking about removing their money from institutions.  When contacted about this, our response in RTE news was to say it was not our role to provide assurances or to stop reporting something we knew was happening, but that if the Governor of the Central Bank or the regulator wanted to say something we would certainly get it on the \"Nine O'Clock News\".  One of the more detailed contributions during the period shortly after the guarantee was Patrick Honohan's Michael Littleton memorial lecture on Radio 1 on 2 December.  In it he stated his analysis that unlimited guarantees add to the cost of the crisis and that where illiquidity is obvious there is usually a deal of insolvency lurking in the background.<\/p><p> If there was a gap in coverage, it was the solvency versus liquidity issue in the main banks.  Although the issue was raised, most notably by Morgan Kelly, there was little evidence from within the institutions until the information from the stress tests started to be revealed.  Had we been able to discover this type of information from within the banking institutions we would have reported it.  Certainly, it would not have been an easy matter given the legal environment.  In the past RTE had fought cases in the Supreme Court to defend the right of the media to continue investigations into wrongdoing in the financial sector, and we would have again.  When we had undisclosed information such as that revealed in David Murphy's story on Irish Life and Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank end of year arrangements we reported it.  However, there were no whistleblowers.  Even when \"Prime Time Investigates\" went back to the issue in the \"Meet the Bankers\" investigation only one could be found.<\/p><p> There are other areas which I believe could have been explored further.  We, like other media, tended to struggle to report on regulatory and administrative structures.  Second, there could have been a greater emphasis on the interlocking of the financial structures and the implications of this for policy responses to the crisis.<\/p><p> The inquiry has asked me about the relationship between the editorial and sales functions within RTE.  In my experience as managing director of news and current affairs, there is none.  When RTE was restructured into integrated business divisions in 2002, with devolved finance, commercial, press and human resources functions, the news and current affairs independent business division, IBD, was kept separate from any commercial activity.  My only contact with the commercial division would be as a member of the executive board, and the only times we would have been consulted on a commercial issue would be on sponsorship options related to content position within news programming, such as weather and traffic.  I have no recollection of any representations or even queries from the commercial side of RTE on an editorial matter and none concerning the subject matter of this inquiry.<\/p><p> The period under review was a time of intense interest in news and current affairs, an interest which grew as the economic crisis developed.  The coverage and reporting I have been outlining were not isolated incidents in specialist publications.  They were all contained on high audience, mainstream programming.  We also know what the audience thought of this coverage.  In 2008, 79% of a national sample of the RTE audience considered economic coverage of a high quality, with a similar figure for business coverage.  The quality of the coverage is due to the expertise and diligence of the RTE staff working in this area and their commitment to public service principles.<\/p><p> I hope I have shown that RTE did, and does, take its responsibilities as a public broadcaster very seriously.  It is essential that we do not just explore what happened but pay great attention to the why, and what is needed structurally and behaviourally to avoid the possibility of another crash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Mulhall","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427328000,"counter":1470,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman, for your welcome.  I do not intend to read the statement I have submitted in full, as it is on the record, but I will take a short amount of time to summarise the main points and, perhaps, give the committee additional information as regards the procedures which are in place in RTE which might be helpful for the members in directing their questions later.<\/p> <p>  RTE is a public service media provider in receipt of public funds.  It is aware that it is owned by the audience, the people of Ireland.  This imposes additional pressures, and rightly so, to protect the audience and its interests.  If a commercial company's prime responsibility is to its shareholders, a public service media organisation's primary responsibility is to its audience.  On the other hand, RTE is charged by law to maximise its commercial revenue.  This is done to supplement the licence fee it receives.  This mixed funding model is intended to lessen the burden on Irish households and the State and allow the organisation to fulfil its public service obligations.  This dual funded model is not unique to Ireland.  The model has been in general use across Europe to fund public service broadcasters for 60 years.<\/p> <p>  RTE is not a commercial company.  It does not make profits, nor does it have a responsibility to shareholders to deliver dividends.  Instead, any income over and above operating costs is reinvested in additional programmes, output and facilities to serve the interests of its audiences.  To document the priorities in this regard RTE produces a public service statement.  This statement is obviously available on its website but is also widely publicised and advertised.  Indeed, we are advertising at present for input to a review of that public service statement from organisations and individuals.  The statement sets out the principles that the organisation must observe to undertake its activities.  The first of the principles is of particular interest to this inquiry.  It states that RTE will remain independent of any vested interest.  I will return to this later in my remarks.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to speak about the commercial revenues and activities, and my experience of these over the 25 years I have been involved and particularly in the period that is of interest to the inquiry.  The major commercial revenue in the years leading up to the banking crisis was advertising revenue, driven mainly by television advertising and, to a lesser extent, sponsorship.<\/p><p>Despite the restrictions placed on RTE&rsquo;s ability to generate advertising revenue as against that available to commercial broadcasters, RTE&rsquo;s advertising revenue grew significantly by 55% during the period under review, with television advertising revenue growing by 60% over the period.<\/p><p> Throughout that period, revenue from the property and financial sectors grew, yet the proportion and relative importance did not.  Property advertising at its highest point reached 0.9% of advertising revenue; at its lowest point it was 0.3%.  The total financial sector, including insurance, building societies, credit cards, banks, credit unions and so on, accounted at the highest point for 4.6% of RTE's revenue, but generally worked out at an average of just over 3% of its total revenue.<\/p><p> My background is in economics and I have worked for many years in RTE generating revenue.  In more recent years my responsibilities have also encompassed the growing area of regulatory affairs.  In this regard I have been involved in European directives, broadcast legislation, submissions to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the development of commercial codes.  I am currently a board member of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, which develops codes for all media in the Irish market, and I chair the on-demand audiovisual service, which develops codes for on-demand providers.  I mention these activities so that the committee understands that at the core of the guiding principles behind these directives, legislation and codes is the protection of the consumer of commercial messages.  My involvement on behalf of RTE in these bodies is to ensure that the principles sacrosanct to a public service organisation are as far as possible mirrored in the wider media environment.<\/p><p> Before concluding my opening remarks, I will return to my first point about RTE&rsquo;s public service statement about remaining independent of vested interests.  The statement goes on to clarify this in more detail, stating that it will follow these principles by \"Ensuring the integrity of its services and that editorial decision-making is not subject to undue influence from any commercial, political, religious, social or cultural interest.\"  In furtherance of this principle within the commercial area, RTE has in place clearance committees.  All commercial activity, whether sponsorship or advertising, is cleared through those clearance committees before it is allowed to go to broadcast.  These clearance committees make sure that the provisions of the codes are applied fully, including those which are relevant to this committee, to do with the transparency of commercial content and its separation from editorial content.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":1472,"content":"<p>I just want to deal with one item before we go to the lead questioners, and that is the issue of the \"Future Shock: Property Crash\" programme that was broadcast in April 2007.

There were complaints that went to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland about the programme.

I think RTE fought that complaint successfully.<br\/><br\/>There was also a deal of press coverage in the immediate aftermath of the programme.

I will walk back into the timeframe I was asked to deal with, because it gives an answer to the Deputy's question.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned in my statement the reaction to the \"Liveline\" programme just before the first guarantee, the &euro;100,000 guarantee on deposits, which was in September.  It is on the record in Deputy Murphy's brother's play, and I think it is in David Murphy's programme as well, that the Minister for Finance contacted the director general arising out of concerns about that \"Liveline\" programme and a worry about a run on the banks and that sort of pressure.  The Minister also contacted me directly, which was unusual.  Normally, my contact with politicians would be informal or through the press representatives.  It was a very proper and in no way inappropriate contact.  The contact was to do with concerns that a Northern Rock-type panic might ensue in the aftermath of that programme.  I had a very formal conversation with him in which I said that we had reported on the six o'clock news that there were concerns about money leaving institutions on that day.  We were accurate in our reporting because we had checked it.  In fact, two correspondents were working on the story at the time.  I said that it was not my role or RTE's role to assure the public that the banks were okay; that was the role of the Central Bank, the regulator or the Minister.  I said that if one of those people wanted to come on air to make those assurances, if they were to make it in time for the nine o'clock news we would make sure that would happen.  What happened was that the Financial Regulator came out to RTE and did an interview with George Lee, and that was broadcast on that evening's nine o'clock news.

They are there because the Irish people have a fascination - maybe not an obsession, which was the word used yesterday - but a fascination with property that is historically well based.

The idea was whether it would be possible for the Financial Regulator to sponsor this, if it wished to so do.  Discussions were held with the Financial Regulator and eventually it never happened.  However, the reason the concept came up was because at the time, as the Senator may remember, the regulator was advertising with RTE.

My officials had meetings with representatives of unions on this issue and we have taken legal advice.  The specific issue in regard to the Corbally case concerns public hearings and what matters should be brought to a public hearing.<\/p><p>I indicated on Second Stage that I intended to bring forward an amendment on having hearings in public being the default position.  That amendment is not being submitted today on Committee Stage but my intention is to bring it forward at a later stage in the Seanad.  The Bill will then return to the D&aacute;il.  That is the substantive issue that is of concern with regard to the court case.  It is not the subject of an amendment today.<\/p><p> There are matters with respect to which I am considering amendments but which are not included today.  With the Chairman's permission and with respect to the committee, I will briefly mention what these are.  The amendments are largely technical changes or amendments designed to bring further coherence to the overall approaches to registration, fitness to teach and vetting throughout the Bill.  I intend that these will be progressed on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  However, the committee will recall that prior to and during the Second Stage debate, I also indicated my intention to provide for the conduct of disciplinary hearings in public, and that I would bring forward these amendments at a later stage.  It has not been possible to finalise the draft provisions in time for the committee's consideration of the Bill today.  I remain committed to the inclusion of this provision and I intend to bring forward amendments in the Seanad to give effect to this policy.  We have to allow sufficient time to seek and consider legal advice and the views expressed by stakeholders, including the stakeholders referred to by the Deputy, as well as the views outlined in the House on Second Stage.  My officials have briefed the teaching unions and the Teaching Council in this respect.<\/p><p> Having taken cognisance of the relevant issues and in light of the legal advice, the approach I plan to take is as follows.  Mirroring recent legislation for other professional regulators, specifically the nursing and midwifery board and the Medical Council, I intend to provide that fitness to teach hearings will be held in public as a default position but that on the request of a witness and where the witness can show reasonable and sufficient cause to the disciplinary committee of the Teaching Council, some or all of the hearings may be held in private.  This approach can cater for long-standing principles of natural justice, such as those espoused in the European Convention on Human Rights.  I also plan to include express provision that the registrant who is the subject of the hearing is entitled to be represented at the hearing and will be furnished in advance with information about evidence in support of the complaint.<\/p><p> As well as the conduct of hearings in public, I will also provide for the publication by the council of the outcome of disciplinary hearings where it is in the public interest to do so and the notification of findings against a teacher to regulators outside the State where appropriate.  Again, this is in keeping with the arrangements applying to other professional regulators, and the legal provisions will be similar to those which already exist.  I am advised and am satisfied that this approach can cater for the types of issues that have been raised in respect of individuals' rights, such as the safeguarding of minors or vulnerable adults, the protection of private lives and privacy concerning medical fitness.  The disciplinary committee will have sufficient discretion to determine when privacy should be employed, including anonymising where it is considered appropriate.  We have a series of steps before any case would come to a public hearing.<\/p><p> The disciplinary committee is largely the body that will make those judgments as to what is severe enough to go to public hearing.  It is also important to be aware that no case will proceed to a hearing without having gone through several screening stages that are designed to weed out less serious complaints that would not merit a full disciplinary inquiry.  Following completion of Committee Stage, my Department will also be proofing the Bill, as amended, and if any technical corrections are required, the necessary amendments will be introduced on Report Stage.  I hope this provides some clarity on the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#B00300","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1858,"content":"<p>I am a little confused by the Minister's comments.

I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by teachers, particularly in Ireland, which is such a small place.  That is one of the points that has been made.  Having a default position where complaints are heard in a public hearing, when the potential for very damaging complaints that may not really have substance, could tarnish the reputation of a teacher or vulnerable children who are put in the limelight when they really should not be.  That is quite problematic and for the protection of both teachers and children, if there is acknowledgement of the need to screen complaints, why should there be a default position of a public hearing?  On a case-by-case basis, as unions and the Teaching Council have indicated, there may be good reason for something to go public.  That should surely be considered on a case-by-case basis if we are going to be sensitive to all the concerns about people's reputations and potential damage.

They discover many weeks afterwards that they have not got paid because they were not registered or they had been removed from the register for some reason.

Deputy Conaghan is right on that point.  I appreciate Deputy Boyd Barrett's concern but there is already provision in regard to informing people that they are not on the register.  I will explain it in more detail.<\/p> <p>  Section 30 of the 2001 Act provides that a person who is employed as a teacher in a recognised school shall not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be paid from Oireachtas funds where he or she is not a registered teacher or where he or she stands removed or suspended from the register.  A substantial communication campaign took place in preparation for the commencement of section 30 of the Act, which was commenced last year, so that all teachers would be well aware of the requirement to be registered and the implications of non-registration.<\/p> <p>  While it appears that the intention behind the amendment is to ensure that a teacher's salary would not be discontinued without that teacher being informed, there are appropriate provisions elsewhere within the Bill that address this issue.  Requirements in regard to the council notifying teachers of decisions made in respect of initial registration, renewal of registration and in regard to fitness to teach inquiries are already in place.  Under the amended Act teachers will therefore be notified of decisions regarding their registration status, including any decision to remove or suspend registration which impacts on payment of salary.  However, as the Teaching Council is not directly involved with teachers' employment or payment, the council would not be in a position to notify teachers of changes to payment in accordance with the amended proposal.  For those reasons I do not consider that the amendment is appropriate in section 30.  <\/p> <p>  There is already provision that teachers will be notified if they are not on the register or if they are removed from the register.  The implication of that is that they will not be paid.  There was an information campaign when that section was brought into place.  We cannot force the Teaching Council to tell people they will not be paid because the Teaching Council does not pay them.  They are paid from a different source but if there is a need to in some way further communicate, I would be very happy to take up the intention of the amendment.

How can there be a situation that a teacher whose registration is not valid, because they have not paid, can commence work and be working, yet the school has not checked that or the teacher, for whatever reason, would not be aware of the fact that their registration is not up to date?  Surely there could be some means, in legislation or otherwise, whereby a better checking mechanism is put in place to ensure the school verifies that the teacher's registration is up to date and that it will be in a position to pay them.

It is the type of phrase that could allow the parish priest to say somebody is not fit and proper, for example.  The proposal is that we be a little more specific about what we mean by fit and proper and remove that subjective phraseology.  What we want them to be, I presume, is qualified and vetted according to the legislation.  The vetting ensures that they are fit and proper.

The Bill's provisions relating to the council being satisfied that an applicant for registration is a fit and proper person to be registered enable the council to consider, before registering a person, whether that person is a suitable person to be registered, including whether that person is a suitable person from a child protection perspective.  A key aim of this Bill is to make Garda vetting an integral part of initial teacher registration and to ensure that any person who is not a suitable person to be registered, including where a person poses a risk to children or vulnerable persons, shall not be registered as a teacher in the first instance.  The effect of amendments Nos. 4 and 6 would be to remove the capacity of the council to assess a Garda vetting disclosure for this purpose.  If amendments Nos. 4 and 6 were accepted, the council would be able to assess a Garda vetting disclosure only for the purposes of determining if a person was qualified to be admitted to the register.  This is clearly not the intended purpose of a vetting disclosure.  The proposed amendments run contrary to the intention of the relevant provisions amending section 31 and the overall child protection aims of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Regarding whether a person is qualified to be registered, the Bill already makes separate provision relating to the council setting out requirements in respect of the qualifications that a person must have attained in order to be registered.

It also puts in place requirements in relation to the council notifying the teacher concerns where the council intends to seek a vetting disclosure for that purpose.  It is important to note that under the Bill not all registered teachers will be vetted each year.  Rather, section 11 of the Bill allows the council to plan and undertake such vetting in a structured and phased manner and sets out what the council will have regard to when considering whether to seek a vetting disclosure in respect of a teacher for renewal of his or her registration.  In that regard, this section will enable the council to prioritise the vetting of those teachers who were never vetted under the non-statutory arrangements, to subsequently address those who have been vetted under the existing non-statutory arrangements but who have not been vetted under the new statutory vetting arrangements and to provide thereafter for periodic revetting of all registered teachers to be undertaken on an ongoing basis.  It also makes provision for the council to notify the teacher in good time where it intends to seek a vetting disclosure as part of renewal.<\/p><p>On review of the published Bill, I considered that the obligations on the council in terms of notifying the teacher where it intends to seek a disclosure as part of the renewal process should be set out in a clearer manner.  The purpose of this amendment is therefore to ensure that in circumstances where the council intends to seek a disclosure for the purposes of renewing the registration of a teacher under section 33, the written notice to the teacher of this intention must also formally request the teacher to comply with the vetting requirement, specify the form and manner by which the teacher can do so, set out why the vetting disclosure is being requested and what it may be used for, and inform the teacher of the obligation under the Act to comply with this vetting request and the consequences for the teacher should he or she fail to comply with such a request.  This amendment ensures that those teachers who are being vetted for renewal of registration purposes receive adequate and timely notification in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#F02900","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427364000,"counter":1938,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1939,"content":"<p>I move amendment No.  10:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 10, line 23, to delete &ldquo;the teacher&rdquo;

The substituted provision involves some minor rewording to make clear that where the council refuses renewal of registration for non-compliance with a vetting requirement the council must have notified the teacher of that requirement for vetting in accordance with the notification requirement of the Bill.<\/p><p>The amendment also involves some re-wording of the provision to make clear that where the council refuses to renew registration on the basis that having received a vetting disclosure it is not satisfied that a person is a fit and proper person to have his or her registration renewed, the council must have reached that decision having considered that vetting disclosure in accordance with the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for assessing vetting disclosures obtained for the purposes of renewal of registration.  These involve providing the teacher with an opportunity to make submissions in respect of the vetting disclosure and also preclude the council from considering specified information contained in a disclosure where that information relates to conduct which occurred prior to the coming into operation of this section and where that conduct would not have constituted a criminal offence at the time it occurred.  This amendment more clearly sets out the requirement for the council in respect of making a decision to refuse renewal of registration in the circumstances specified in the Bill.  It also amends the Bill to provide that where the council renews a teacher&rsquo;s registration subject to conditions a time limit may be set by the council within which such conditions are to be fulfilled.  It is logical that there should be a time-line for conditions to be complied with but the time limit provision was absent from the published Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#G00100","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1954,"content":"<p>In respect of a reference to the council&rsquo;s code of conduct, &ldquo;that he or she has engaged in conduct contrary to a code of professional conduct established by the Council under section 7(2)(b);&rdquo; there is an ongoing dispute between the Minister and the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI, about junior certificate reform.

The amendment is to allow a teacher have extra time should he or she request it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#G02000","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1973,"content":"<p>Is this where a teacher is temporarily removed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#G02100","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1974,"content":"<p>This is where a condition is set and the teacher is temporarily removed and must comply with certain things to get back on the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#G02200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1975,"content":"<p>Is it clear that is the meaning of the term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#G02300","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1976,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy speaking about the word \"temporary\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#G02400","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1977,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#G02500","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1978,"content":"<p>The wording in the Bill is: &ldquo;that teacher&rsquo;s registration stands renewed subject to the condition for such portion of the period for compliance\".

The Bill, however, precludes the council from making such a complaint in respect of specified information in a disclosure which relates to conduct that occurred prior to Part V of the Act becoming operational where that conduct would not have constituted an offence at the time it occurred.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarity in the wording used in this provision to ensure that the wording of the provision does not also preclude the council from making a complaint in relation to other information in such a disclosure, perhaps criminal records or other specified information, which gives rise to a bona fide concern that the teacher may harm, attempt to harm or cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#H01200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427364000,"counter":1992,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1993,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 15, to delete lines 38 and 39 and substitute the following:&quot;(I) by the substitution of &quot;may refuse to refer a complaint&quot; for &quot;shall refuse an application&quot;, and&quot;.<\/blockquote>This amendment aims to ensure that the director is not obliged to refuse a complaint that does not satisfy certain requirements but has discretion on whether to refuse the complaint or refer it to the investigating committee.  The current provision, in accordance with section 43 of the principal Act, requires that the director shall refuse to refer a complaint to the investigating committee where the complaint is not made in writing, signed by the complainant or accompanied by such documents and information as may be relevant to the complaint or where the director considers that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, is made in bad faith or is an abuse of process.  It is considered more suitable for the director to have discretion based on the information available to him or her in relation to each individual complaint to refer the complaint to the investigating committee and not to have to refuse it in all cases.  For example, a complainant may not be able to satisfy the requirement to include documents relevant to the complaint if the complainant is not aware of or in possession of such documents.

However, it is more appropriate that, where the director's decision to refuse the complaint has been appealed, the investigating committee would consider in the first instance whether it agrees with that decision, rather than proceeding to investigating committee stage.

It provides that the panel may consider the disclosure in the same manner as the investigating committee may consider it.

I wish to broaden the avenues available to parents and students who are not satisfied with how a board of management deals with a particular complaint or issue.  At the moment under section 9 of the Education Act the only instances in which an appeal can be made to the Secretary General of the Department relate primarily to enrolment issues and also to issues of suspension or expulsion of a student from a school.  Where a parent of a child is dissatisfied with how a board of management deals with any other issue no avenue of appeal is open to them outside of a court application.<\/p><p>Often, in the past when people contacted the Department on the matter they were referred to the Ombudsman for Children.  However, that office is restricted in handling complaints made to it to the process by which the complaint was dealt with as opposed to the content of a complaint.  That is something which needs to be addressed.  It is a role in which the Department, as the overseeing body for education and the setting of education policy, needs to become involved.  In addition, the Department is the primary funding body for education.  We need the Department to provide avenues for appeals to be made to it where a family or a young person aged over 18 feel they have been treated disproportionately or unfairly or a decision has been made by a board of management which is not in their best interests and where there is no provision for an appeal in that regard to another body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#J03200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":2045,"content":"<p>The issue relating to sections 28 and 29 must be addressed but it is not appropriate to this legislation.

It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the schools concerned.  I am not satisfied that the current provisions of section 28, which was of its time, and I plan to revise it in order to provide in law for a charter.  There is a commitment to introduce a charter for parents and learners.  The Deputy will be aware that changes to the Education Act 1998 will be necessary to provide for and support the introduction of a parents and learners charter, and that I am already considering amendments to sections 28 and 29 of the Education Act in that context.<\/p> <p>  The 1998 Act does not provide a cohesive approach to enhancing the manner in which parents and students are served by schools.  With that in mind, a set of principles will be required to act as the foundation of a charter to strengthen the relationship between parents, students and schools and the position of parents and students generally within the school system.  Therefore, discussion on the matter proposed by the Deputy is premature at this time.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to have his proposals considered and debated in due course when amendments to sections 28 and 29 of the Education Act are progressed further.
