Session 1 this morning is a public hearing with Mr. Michael Doorly, former financial director of Independent News and Media, and Mr. Gerry O'Regan, former editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, on the role of the media in the lead into the banking crisis in the period from 2002 to 2007.  I welcome everyone to the 17th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.<\/p><p>During our sessions this week we are hearing from a number of witnesses on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead-in to the banking crisis 2002 to 2007 and any changes in approach after the crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. Michael Doorly, former finance director of Independent News and Media, and Mr. Gerry O'Regan, former editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  Specifically, Mr. Regan and Mr. Doorly have been invited to discuss the independence of editorial policy on the economy and property boom and, separately, their newspapers' business model and sources of revenue including that from the real estate sector in the period from 2002 to 2007.<\/p><p>Mr. Doorly is the company secretary of Independent News and Media plc.  He is an experienced senior executive in the group and has held a variety of senior management roles in the subsidiary Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Limited, including that of sales and marketing director, finance director and operations director.  He has also travelled extensively with the group to New Zealand, South Africa and the UK.  Mr. Gerry O'Regan was editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>for seven years from 2005 to 2012.  Prior to that he was editor of <i>The Herald<\/i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>for periods of six years and five years respectively.  Before that he was deputy editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and held various other editorial positions on the newspaper.  Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan are welcome before the inquiry.<\/p><p>Before I begin I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  In whatever sequence they wish, I invite Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan to make their opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#A00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427328000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us.  As the Chairman outlined, I was editor of the<i>Irish Independent<\/i>for a period of seven years from 2005 to 2012, and I was previously editor of <i>The Herald<\/i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>for a total of 11 years.<br\/><br\/>I am qualified to discuss the editorial policy of the newspaper during my period as editor, rather than matters such as advertising revenue streams.  The established policy and practice of strict separation of the editorial and advertising functions meant I was solely responsible for editorial direction.  Under line management systems, other executives were accountable for commercial activities such as advertising.  Correspondence on behalf of the committee states it wishes to specifically discuss &quot;editorial policy on the economy and the property boom (2002-2007)&quot;.<\/p><p>By way of background and context, I think it should be noted that the overall role of an independent media in a free society is both complicated and nuanced, depending on events and circumstances.  However, my essential point in relation to editorial policy, particularly with regard to economic coverage, is that there was no conscious attempt on my part, or on the part of the newspaper, to fuel what has been described as the property boom.  It would be wrong, I think, to retrospectively arrive at definitive conclusions regarding the coverage of the economy and the property market on the basis of subsequent events and evidence which was not then but is now in the public domain.<br\/><br\/>The ever-changing dynamic which is a mass-selling daily newspaper requires sophisticated analysis when it comes to assessing editorial coverage on a particular issue.  As the biggest-selling daily newspaper in the country, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>has a wide and multilayered readership base.  These demographics, by definition, continue to evolve.  The primary objective of an editor is to try to cater for such readership requirements by marrying statistical data and social trends with editorial instinct.  The roadmap for editing, therefore, by definition, remains constantly subject to change, depending on changing events.<br\/><br\/>Coverage of the economy and related matters, such as the property market, is a key part of the journalistic remit of a paper like the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  However, such coverage cannot be conducted in an intellectual vacuum, and editors, writers, contributors and analysts cannot but be influenced by the prevailing climate at a given point in time.  Certainly, up to and including 2007, the overwhelming consensus both domestically and abroad was that Ireland had transformed itself economically.  The country had by then enjoyed a number of years of unparalleled prosperity, manifest most of all in historically low unemployment rates and a period of net immigration for the first time in the history of the State.<br\/><br\/>It is important to give cognisance to the economic context and background in which media reporting and commentary we are now discussing took place.  It was obviously done within the parameters of knowledge at that particular point in time.  Certain objective data statistics and facts have to be taken into account when we look back at the period we are now reassessing.  The facts show the economy grew strongly from 2002 and this continued in 2007.  National debt was among the lowest in the developed world at 25% of GDP.  The country's fiscal performance was outstanding and employment levels were at heights never seen before in Ireland.  All of these factors led to a powerful so-called &quot;national feel-good factor''.  Ongoing reporting and analysis of economic and related matters continued against this background.  Central to some of the arguments being considered by the committee is that editorial work had to be carried out within the framework of known events and facts at that particular time.<br\/><br\/>The overwhelming consensus was that, despite the rapid growth of the construction industry and the ongoing rise in house prices, the essential pillars of our economy were sound.  The prevailing wisdom was that if a property bubble was to emerge, the country's still high employment figures and positive Government finances would mitigate against a serious economic downturn.  Hence the widespread belief in the financial, economic and political communities that a ''soft landing'' would result from the rapid expansion of the property and construction sectors over the previous number of years.  It is important to note also that this was the prevailing economic consensus abroad, particularly at EU level, and the approach to Irish fiscal and economic strategies by various reputable international organisations could be described as removed and benign, seemingly on the presumption that the fundamentals of our economy were sound.<br\/><br\/>As we now know, however, and as has so often happened in similar circumstances throughout economic history, underlying trends were gathering pace which would have serious negative implications for Ireland.  Clouds were gathering in the international financial world and the storm that erupted in 2008 led to a global financial crisis, which had profound economic and fiscal consequences for the economies of both the USA and Europe, and particularly for those on the periphery of things, such as Ireland.  In time, such developments would have profound consequences, particularly for our own banking structure.<br\/><br\/>The consequences for the Irish economy have been well documented, but for the period I have been asked to comment on, 2002 to 2007, the full import of a changing economic landscape worldwide was still in the future, and, as such, could not completely inform editorial coverage in the newspaper.  My predominant objective as editor was to optimise the circulation of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  By definition, in an intensely competitive environment, this meant embracing and encouraging wide-ranging and diverse views in its editorial content.  Daily newspapers articulate and reflect various dimensions of what has been described as &quot;the national conversation&quot; at any particular point in time.  Sometimes, of course, the predictions and assertions by some commentators about possible future trends may prove to be incorrect, but that really is intrinsic to the very essence of journalism, including economic forecasting.<br\/><br\/>The ultimate safety valve for the maintenance of editorial standards in a newspaper is the perception and understanding of its readers.  They can be influenced in making the ultimate choice, and it is a very grim choice for any editor - they can decide to stop buying the paper - if they believe certain editorial standards are not being met.  For all media, including newspapers, the consumer is the ultimate judge and jury.  For this and other reasons, which I hope will emerge in the discussion to follow, there was no hidden agenda in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>to try to artificially bolster the property market for the period under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you.

During the period which is the subject of the committee's inquiry, I was finance director of Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited, which is the Irish subsidiary of Independent News and Media plc.  At the outset I would like to briefly address the subject of the role of the media from a commercial perspective.  It is generally accepted that one of the lynchpins of a democratic society is a free press which operates on an independent basis.  It follows that, in order to establish and maintain independence, media enterprises must be financially sustainable and capable of survival in a commercial and competitive environment.  In seeking to achieve this, the print media has two core sources of income: these are revenue from the sales of its publications and revenues from advertising.  Both income streams are vital and there is an interdependence between them.<\/p> <p>  The reality, of course, is that the publication is the core product which, through the quality of its content and its success in building circulation, sales and readership, creates a channel for advertisers to promote their goods and services.  Advertising revenues are, therefore, a factor of the reputation and integrity of a publication, which is built through good reporting and good journalism, and content that is relevant to its readership.  The requirement to maintain and build on this editorial integrity underpins Independent News and Media's policy of a strict and absolute separation of the editorial and commercial functions within the organisation.<\/p> <p>  The committee of inquiry has requested me to address a number of matters, including the company's business model and sources of revenue, including revenue from the real estate sector.  They have asked me to address the importance of property-related revenues within the overall revenue mix, the group's engagement in property-related commercial activity and the relationship between the editorial and sales functions.<\/p><p>The committee will understand that the company, as a commercial organisation operating in a highly competitive industry, is not in a position to disclose detailed financial figures that would be of potential benefit, and certainly of interest, to our competitors.  However, I will attempt to deal with the issues in a manner that provides the committee with substantive information which will meet its requirements.<br\/><br\/>Referring to the business model, Independent News and Media is the largest media operation on the island of Ireland.  It is also a public limited company.  The group has a strong portfolio of national, regional and local print titles, including the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, which is the market leader among the dailies, and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, Ireland&rsquo;s biggest-selling Sunday newspaper.  The production and distribution of newspapers is a complex operation, but in the business sense it is quite simple: we sell newspapers and we sell advertising.<br\/><br\/>Referring to sources of income, newspaper revenues are derived from two sources: circulation sales and advertising revenues.  Between 2002 and 2007 Ireland was a country in the throes of a major economic boom.  GDP grew strongly in each of those years and newspaper sales and advertising revenues enjoyed increases broadly in line with the economy.  Over the period, the revenues of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>increased by an average of 6.5% per annum.  This is a total of 37.6%.  I wish to correct the figure of 31.7% presented in my written submission.  Advertising revenues increased by an average of 9% per annum, or 52% over the period.  Circulation sales increased by an average of 3% per annum, or 17% during the period.  This is not surprising in an economy in which personal consumption was growing at an average rate of almost 5% a year.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the revenue mix, in 2002, 60% of overall revenues came from advertising, with the remaining 40% coming from circulation.  By 2007, 66% of overall revenues came from advertising, with 34% coming from circulation.  This movement is not insignificant, but neither could it be described as a paradigm shift.<br\/><br\/>Referring to the importance of property-related advertising in the overall revenue mix, it is clear that the demand for advertising space to promote housing developments increased throughout the period under review.  The increase was in line with the scale of activity in the residential property market, where house completions increased by an average of 13% per annum, from 57,695 units in 2002 to just over 93,000 units in 2006.<br\/><br\/>From a relatively low base, property-related revenues in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>grew by a similar 13% per annum, or a quantum of 89% over the period.  For reference purposes, it is worth noting that advertising of travel increased by 25% per annum throughout this period, or a quantum of 153%.  Revenues from property-related advertising represented an average of 14% of total advertising income and accounted for just over 9% of overall income - that is, income including both circulation sales and advertising revenues.<br\/><br\/>In his submission, my former colleague Gerry O'Regan gave an insight into the role of the media during the economic boom and subsequent crash.  The only comment I will add, specifically concerning the property market, is that the media, in my view, cannot create or sustain a boom.  Demand for property is created by a mix of factors over which the media have no control.  These include overall economic conditions, employment levels, consumer confidence, the availability of finance, demographics, the rate of home formation, and society's capacity for risk.<br\/><br\/>In relation to information sought concerning engagement in property-related commercial activity, I can advise the committee that INM did not engage in property development activities and was at no stage a participant in the property industry.  I would like to add, however, that as part of our normal operations the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>did relocate its printing business from Abbey Street in Dublin city centre to Citywest in Dublin 24 and relocated its publishing division to Talbot Street in Dublin 1 in 2004.  This was in line with other publishers in moving printing facilities out of what were congested city centre areas.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the relationship between the editorial and sales functions, Mr. O'Regan and I have outlined the position concerning the complete separation of the editorial and commercial functions within our organisation.  I thank the Chairman and I hope my comments are of assistance to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doorly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan for their opening statements.

The reality is that our business is built around the product, and in this case the success of the product, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, is dependent on good reporting, on good journalism and on presenting content that is relevant to its readership.  The paper comes first, and through its success, which is measured in terms of circulation, sales and readership numbers, it does create a platform for advertisers to target their audience and promote their goods and services.  The balance that the Chairman referred to is therefore weighted towards the newspaper, and this is the domain of the editor and is separate from the commercial functions.  In practice, the editor will hold daily conferences to review the news agenda and the make-up of the paper; there is no commercial representation at those sessions.  It is the domain of the editor and it is separate from the commercial functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doorly"},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I have a question for Mr. O'Regan on a similar theme.

What I was conscious of particularly when I started editing the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>was to try to broaden its overall economic coverage.  I was appointed editor on 28 September 2005 and within a few weeks I met a man for lunch whose name has already come up repeatedly here at the committee meetings, Mr. David McWilliams.  I signed him up to write for the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>when I was ten weeks into the job.  He joined on 22 December, we both went off and enjoyed our Christmases and he started to write everything that he saw fit from early in 2006.

I have an extract from the newspaper edition of 4 July 2007 when Brendan Keenan was responding to the statements made by Morgan Kelly.  He wrote in the context of an ESRI survey:<blockquote><br \/><br \/><font color=\"#111111\">Actually, there is a bigger danger; that the property market - rather than having a soft landing or a bumpy landing - crashes and burns.  This was the scenario outlined in the ESRI quarterly bulletin by UCD economist Morgan Kelly.<\/font><font color=\"#111111\">Although it was contained in the bulletin, it was not part of the ESRI forecast.  That predicts a soft landing, with house building falling 10pc over the 18 months, and house prices stabilising after a 3pc fall this year.  Prof Kelly takes a different view.  Based on property booms and busts in different countries over the past 40 years, an Irish crash could knock up to 60pc off the real (after inflation) price of houses over the next 10 years, he says.  The first thing to be said about Prof Kelly's scenario is that it\u00a0<\/font><i><font color=\"#111111\">could<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#111111\"> happen.<\/font><\/blockquote><font color=\"#111111\">In other words, it could lead to a massive property crash.

It would be as if the paper tomorrow carried economic predictions for the next year.  They will often vary in the context of the writer or economist who is making the judgment.

What happens then is that the advertisers looking for channels to promote their goods and services will review the numbers and will or will not advertise, as appropriate.  The circulation and readership figures, as I said, are quite stable.  It is the advertising element that will rise and fall in line with the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#G02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doorly"},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Mr. Doorly made the point that the company tried to expand into different sectors and different jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#G02600","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427328000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>As a plc with shareholder expectations and so on we are always trying to improve the bottom line.

I am speaking as the former editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  I retired in June 2011, having been appointed editor in October 2002.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, I was asked me to address the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007; the approach to reporting on the property market and the economy; and the contribution of the media to public understanding and debate around fiscal-budgetary policies and their implications.  I have also been asked to cover the business model and sources of revenue.  I will deal with that issue later.<br\/><br\/>I will be as helpful as I can in answering the committee's questions.  In the limited time given to me to prepare this submission I have been unable to review every single aspect of the newspaper&rsquo;s coverage in news, analysis, comment, opinion page, letters to the editor, etc.  I have been asked to account for coverage over six years - 52 weeks a year, six editions per week, adding up to 1,872 publication days.  It was impossible for me to read and review all of the material in every single issue of<i>The Irish Times<\/i>published in that period and I hope the committee will understand this.  Unfortunately, the archive does not easily facilitate such a detailed analysis.<br\/><br\/>By way of introduction, I should, first, provide some background on how <i>The Irish Times<\/i>operates since it may be helpful in our discussion.  Unlike most other newspapers, it is owned by a trust.  There are only a handful of newspapers owned by trusts in the world today.  The main object of The Irish Times Trust Ltd and the company which manages and operates the newspaper, The Irish Times Limited, is &quot;to publish The Irish Times as an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland free from any form of personal or of party political, commercial, religious or other control&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The memorandum and articles of association set out the policy principles of the newspaper: the support of constitutional democracy through governments fairly elected; the progressive achievement of social justice between people and the discouragement of discrimination of all kinds; the promotion of a society where the quality of life is enriched by the standards of its education, its art, its culture, and its recreational facilities, and where the quality of spirit is instinct with Christian values but free from all religious bias and discrimination; the promotion of peace and tolerance and opposition to all forms of violence and hatred so that each man may live in harmony with his neighbour [I presume they intended women to be involved also] considerate for his cultural, material and spiritual needs; and the promotion of understanding of other nations and peoples and a sympathetic concern for their well-being.<br\/><br\/>The objects of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>require that, in its journalism, news shall be as accurate and comprehensive as is practicable and be presented fairly; comment and opinion shall be informed and responsible, and shall be identifiable from fact; and that special consideration shall be given to the reasonable representation of minority interests and divergent views.  I have appended a copy of the memorandum and articles of association for the committee's perusal.<br\/><br\/>From the above, the committee can see that <i>The Irish Times<\/i>has an unusual structure where the managing director and the editor each report independently to the board.  It is designed to ensure the effective management of the newspaper&rsquo;s strategic and commercial functions and the independence of the editor, working within the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy.  There is a partnership of equals with different responsibilities.  It seems appropriate, therefore, that I address  section 1 of the committee's questions and the former managing director, Ms Maeve Donovan, section 2 because of our separate roles.<br\/><br\/>I was asked to address the context of the banking crisis.  Let me put the reporting of the economy and the property market in the context of some of the other major news events at home and abroad that we covered in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>between 2002 and 2007 because we were not single-mindedly looking at the property market or the state of the economy.  During that period there were two general elections; the invasion of Iraq; the introduction of the euro; changes in the leadership of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna F&aacute;il;  ten new members of the European Union; Mary McAleese&rsquo;s election as President; the deaths of Pope John Paul II, Liam Lawlor and Charles J. Haughey;  the historic meeting between Dr. Ian Paisley and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in Dublin, just to mention a few events.  There was also<i>The Irish Times<\/i>story in September 2006 that the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, was receiving moneys from businessmen while he was Minister for Finance, which was to lead to the newspaper&rsquo;s appearance before the Mahon tribunal and costly challenges in the High Court and the Supreme Court to establish the journalistic right to protect sources.  I have supplied an appendix giving more detail of the types of issue that would have preoccupied an editor at the time.<br\/><br\/>However, admittedly with the benefit of hindsight, the boom and bust in the economy were the major event that spanned all of these years and had most impact on the lives of the people.<\/p><p>Editorial policy, by definition, is found in the leaders that express the views of the newspaper as determined by, or on behalf of, the editor every day.  I was able in the limited time available to review the editorials and leaders published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>over the 1,872 editions that are the subject of this inquiry.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>wrote 289 leaders expressing editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007.  They were a major issue of concern in the editorial columns in those years.  There were 38 leading articles in 2002, 73 in 2003, 56 in 2004, 52 in 2005, 31 in 2006 and 39 in 2007.<br\/><br\/>I am taking a narrow view of what the committee means by the economy and the property boom.  Throughout those years, it is fair to say that the policy of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>was critical of both the establishment and operation of the Financial Regulator and IFSRA, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, believing they were not independent of the Central Bank.  The newspaper was concerned about the erosion of competitiveness and critical of benchmarking in the determination of public sector pay, cautious about the banks&rsquo; lending policies and the scale of the property market.  As an aside, the chairman of the board of The Irish Times Limited was the Financial Regulator between 2002 and 2008.  I have attached an appendix on editorial policy on the economy and the property boom.<br\/><br\/>From 2003 onwards, the newspaper was warning that trends in the mortgage market were a cause for concern.  This policy was consistently expressed in editorials in the following years.  By way of illustration, in 2006, the newspaper was calling on the Central Bank and the then Government to analyse the risks the property market posed to future financial stability in an article &ldquo;Rate change cause for moderation&rdquo; on 3 March.  In case I could be accused of being selective, I am presenting all editorials to the committee for its perusal.  I have also written a short summary of the policy positions relevant to the banking inquiry.<br\/><br\/>In their book, <i>The Fall of the Celtic Tiger: Ireland and the Euro Debt Crisis<\/i>, the authors Donal Donovan and Antoin E. Murphy identified four separate but related crises that resulted in the collapse of the Irish economy which required an international financial rescue.  These were, first, a property crash as the housing price bubble burst; second, a banking collapse where banks carrying too many non-performing property loans had their solvency questioned; third, fiscal failure as the economy contracted and tax revenue from property collapsed leading to the fourth crisis, sovereign debt.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>covered all four crises in detail as these stories unfolded in stages over the years to the best of its ability.  The coverage involved detailed news and analysis by reporters, specialist correspondents in the finance and business fields and the economic editors of that decade.  In effect, Simon Carswell became a full-time specialist in covering the banking crisis.  Extra resources and pagination were provided to the newspaper during this period.  In addition to reporting, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>commissioned articles about the banking crisis and the property market from specialists and noted academic economists.  Its opinion pages were the platform for divergent views and public debate that often set the agenda and contributed to the national debate.<br\/><br\/><i>The Irish Times<\/i>was the only newspaper to publish the article by Morgan Kelly, professor of economics in University College Dublin, predicting there would be a property crash with prices falling by between 40% and 60%.  The first article was carried on 28 December 2006.  Two others were carried subsequently.  Other noted contributors to the debate in the newspaper included the current Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, then professor in Trinity College Dublin, Professors Karl Whelan and Ray Kinsella, both University College Dublin, Brian Lucey, lecturer in finance, Trinity College Dublin, and Alan Ahearne, professor of economics, National University of Ireland, Galway.  He later became an adviser to the late Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Finance.<br\/><br\/>The same editorial standards applied in the property supplements as elsewhere in the newspaper.  There was no trade-off between editorial and advertising.  Advertising features were clearly signposted.  Advertisers did not write editorial copy.  We never carried advertorials in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  The newspaper had occasion late in 2007 to make a complaint to the professional bodies of auctioneers and valuers that some estate agents were providing the property supplement with misleading selling prices.  The newspaper took the view that if agents were unwilling to supply accurate information or if the vendors were reluctant to disclose the true selling price, then it would be damaging to the credibility of the newspaper to carry the results.  The introduction of the national property register in 2012 was a consequence of this discovery and disclosure in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>This review of editorial policy and the approach to reporting on the property boom in the run-up to the banking crisis proved to be an interesting exercise for me.  I was challenged to consider whether in my then role as editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>journalists could or should have foreseen the multifaceted nature of the financial crisis, including the property crash and the banking collapse.  I do not know what we could have done differently to put ourselves in the position to predict the magnitude of the fall.  We reported the news forensically.  We challenged the consensus and canvassed all views and published them.  The media, as always, were reliant on reporting the views of the specialists, be they Government, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator or the profession of economists.  Journalists were less well-placed than others to make an accurate assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kennedy.

As my colleague Geraldine Kennedy addressed the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy in the period in question, I will attempt to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions on the company, its business model, property-related commercial activity and the editorial-commercial relationship.<br\/><br\/><i>The Irish Times<\/i>newspaper is published by The Irish Times Limited and its controlling shareholder is The Irish Times Trust Limited.  The Irish Times Limited exists to publish <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It is prohibited from providing dividends to its shareholders.  Accordingly, all profits are retained in the company.  The Irish Times Trust Limited has certain powers under the memorandum and articles to appoint and remove directors of The Irish Times Limited, to call general meetings and the control of significant acquisitions and disposals.  The primary role of the trust is to appoint a board which it believes will ensure the company is well run and adheres to its core objects.  Thereafter, the trust leaves the board to get on with it.  The board has the responsibility of adhering to the main object concerning the quality and independence of <i>The Irish Times.<\/i>The trust acts a second guarantor or long stop, a responsibility grounded in the trust as a whole.<br\/><br\/>Editorial policy at <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is the responsibility of the board of The Irish Times Limited.  In practical terms, day-to-day policy is executed by the editor and team in the context of the memorandum and articles of the company.  The core requirement is trust, integrity and balance.  As managing director, I had no input into day to day editorial decisions.  The managing director is, however, responsible for the overall viability, performance and development of the business, including responsibility for strategy.<br\/><br\/>Regarding business model and sources of revenue 2002 to 2007, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>business model is a traditional one in the quality newspaper sector in Europe and elsewhere.  Newsgathering and all ancillary activities are funded by a combination of cover price and newspaper sales revenue, subscription revenue and advertising revenue, both print and digital.  During the inquiry&rsquo;s reference period, growing revenues derived from printing external publications.  The latter commenced in 2002 with the commissioning of the company&rsquo;s new printing plant at Citywest.  The ratio of advertising to circulation revenue was typically 60:40 on average.  This moved up and down depending on the state of the economy.  Key advertising sectors, particularly for quality newspaper titles, are property, recruitment, general classifieds including motors and display or run-of-paper advertising.<\/p><p>The classifieds include cars and small ads in various categories.  The run-of-paper advertising is largely about retail, food, financial services and so on.<br\/><br\/>During the reference period, the steady advance of digital media, and hence digital advertising, was a key strategic challenge for the company. This remains the case for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and indeed all print media, as the pace of digital adoption continues to increase.<br\/><br\/>On the importance of property-related revenues to the overall revenue mix, property is a key pillar of the newspaper&rsquo;s publishing revenue.  The commercial property supplement in Wednesday&rsquo;s newspaper and the residential property supplement on Thursday are important to readers as well as advertisers.  The readers of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>have a strong interest in both residential and commercial property.  They are buyers for both categories and many are also property investors.  In addition to the dedicated supplements, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>also provides extensive coverage on homes, interiors and related lifestyle content.  In an overall context, therefore, property is a key driver of readership both print and online for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  From an advertising perspective, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>'s audience is of particular interest to companies trading in the sector.  This has been the case for decades and certainly through my entire period at the newspaper.  The company&rsquo;s acknowledged success in the property advertising market has attracted new domestic and UK players into this market and into the sector.<br\/><br\/>When I came to work for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in 1977, it was the market leader in the property sector.  That position was maintained through the 1980s and 1990s, through the reference period, and it continues today.  Through the decades there have been new market entrants in both print and digital formats.  The market is highly competitive and highly diversified.  Globally, the long-standing success of newspapers in the pillar categories of property and recruitment is what gave rise, in large part, to the arrival of standalone digital websites and the resulting disruption of the newspaper&rsquo;s commercial model.<br\/><br\/>During the reference period, the company sought to balance increasing exposure to the property sector through a range of diverse activities.  The most notable of these was the development of strong external printing revenues from the Citywest plant.<br\/><br\/>The relationship between the editorial and commercial functions is clearly drawn in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Irish Times Trust.  It specifies that editorial content in the newspaper shall be &quot;free from any form of personal or party political, commercial religious or other sectional control&quot;.  That separation is carefully maintained under the stewardship of both the trust and the board.  This requirement of the company is deeply embedded in the company's culture.  It is heavily emphasised from the induction of new staff onwards, and it is fundamental to the way in which the company operates.<br\/><br\/>At a macro level, everybody in the organisation understands the importance of advertising to the enterprise.  At the micro level, all staff, both editorial and commercial, are aware of the necessity of maintaining the separation of editorial and commercial activities.  Customers of the business are also very much aware of this.  This does mean that clients do not sometimes complain, but the role of the business team, especially its management, is to act as a buffer between commercial interests and the producers of editorial content.  This practice is regarded within the company as a key asset, and the independence of the newspaper is emphatically stressed when the newspaper is marketed to clients.  It is one of the key differentiators of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>within the Irish newspaper sector.<br\/><br\/>On engagement in property-related commercial activity, during the reference period <i>The Irish Times<\/i>engaged in two notable transactions.  The first was the purchase of the website <i>myhome.ie<\/i>.  As early as the late 1990s, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>sought to secure its position in key markets as revenue started to migrate from print to digital media.  Standalone classified sites had started to proliferate, particularly in Europe and the USA.  Obtaining a market-leading property site in the sector became a key strategic objective for the company and, hence, for the management team.  Along the way, the company developed several digital iterations in the property sector.  We had <i>ireland.com\/property<\/i>, and owned the ireland.com portal at that time.  We also had <i>irishtimesproperty.com<\/i>and <i>nicemove.ie<\/i>.  Despite considerable investment and marketing activity, none of these sites proved to be viable competition for <i>myhome.ie<\/i>, which was the market leader and had grown exponentially from its launch in 2000.  Therefore, our company&rsquo;s intentions turned to growth by acquisition.  The <i>myhome.ie<\/i>business became available for sale in 2006.  The Irish Times Limited retained NCB as an adviser for the bidding process.  There was a competitive process with at least two other bidders involved.  The acquisition was unanimously approved by the board of The Irish Times Limited and the transaction was approved by the shareholder, the Irish Times Trust.  The website became part of the Irish Times Group and today it remains a key strategic asset of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and trades profitably.  <i>The Irish Times <\/i>has a strong position in both print and digital media in a sector which has substantial revenue streams, which will help to protect the title into the future.  Successfully making the migration from print to digital is essential to the survival of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and indeed to all print media.<br\/><br\/>The second transaction was the sale of the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street premises and the leasing of the Irish Times building in Tara Street from Dublin City Council.  During 2005 and 2006, the company had been examining changing work practices and creating an appropriate environment for a changing business.  Various options were examined, including extensive remodelling of its listed buildings in D&rsquo;Olier Street.  The cost of redevelopment was prohibitive and inevitably required compromising on the space requirements.  Therefore, the decision was made to seek modern accommodation within the city centre, proximate to key sites such as the D&aacute;il.  A suitable property was identified and the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street buildings were sold in 2007.  The company transferred operations to Liffey House in Tara Street, a facility which was much more suitable for the development of the newspaper and a range of digital business interests.  The price achieved, &euro;29.1 million, was considerably higher than the company had anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Donovan.

In the first few years I was there, it did not change a lot in many ways.  The big technological change was probably the move to photo-typesetting in the first instance.  That was a huge, traumatic change in the industry.  Then, at the end of the 1980s, there was the arrival of colour.  That again facilitated growth and change in the business, but the pace of change as we moved into the mid-1990s just took off like a runaway train in the industry globally.  A large part of that was to do with the process around the disruption of any industry.  It was not unlike communications or the phone industry.  People from outside the media industry could see that a large amount of revenue was running through this business.  With the developments in technology, they were looking at ways in which they could disrupt that industry and take some of that business away.
