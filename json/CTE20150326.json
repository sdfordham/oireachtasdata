The Secretary General is giving us the annual operating cost for 2015.  These are 20 year contracts.

I had specifically asked that the information be provided to us even on a local authority basis to avoid that kind of problem.  The Secretary General could have been more helpful.  He was well able to give us the operating cost based on the 115 contracts <i>in situ<\/i>, broken down by region, the south, the east, the north west and the total.  All I am asking for is the total cost of those 115 contracts.  I do not need to know about the individual contracts for wastewater treatment plants in Ringsend, Portlaoise, Mullingar or Roscrea.

The correspondence is to be noted and published.  We will be able to have an in-depth discussion on this matter and other issues and the general accounts of the HSE next Thursday, 2 April.  We have indicated to the HSE that because of the number of items on the agenda the meeting may last a full day.  <br\/><br\/>No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated Monday, 23 February 2015, from Mr. Seamus Carroll regarding moneys owed for works carried out at Ennis General Hospital.  The committee has come across a number of these cases - Deputy Deasy referred to one such case - in relation to the payment of contractors and subcontractors.  This case involves Glenbeigh Construction which I understand is a firm that procures many public capital projects.  It appears that this small firm is losing out.  The State should not facilitate this.  The committee will again write to the HSE to ask it to review the case to see if steps could be taken which would result in the contractor being paid.  This is an issue across Departments where contracts are made available and something needs to be done to protect the small firms and individuals who end up doing this work in order that issue will not continue to arise.  The committee will write to the Department about it and will raise it again at next week's meeting.<br\/><br\/>No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated Tuesday, 3 March 2015, received from the HSE on the payment of allowances at St. James's Hospital.  The committee can discuss this issue next week with the HSE and will forward the correspondence to the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA to ensure salaries should not be paid to public servants for lecturing.  <br\/><br\/>No. 3B.3 is correspondence received from Ms Susan Gray, chairperson of PARC, the road safety group.  It concerns the recording of information by court clerks on drivers who are disqualified but who do not have their licences endorsed.  The correspondence is to be noted.  This matter was raised when we discussed the issue of penalty points.  We have made a recommendation which is being considered by the criminal justice working group, from which we should receive an update.

The committee has seen that there is no proper policy being pursued in the HSE on travel or entertainment.  It is clearly not good enough that F&Aacute;S should have taken it on itself to provide the same services for its members' spouses as it did for its members in certain categories.  The committee needs to look at the issue on a broader basis and write to all of the agencies involved requesting them to examine their practices to ensure they are in compliance with proper standard practices.  This issue comes up from time to time in the case of the HSE, F&Aacute;S and other agencies.  In the case of F&Aacute;S, there is a legacy issue, it pertains also during the years in a number of agencies.  As well as ensuring the committee has it finally sorted out, I suggest it write to all bodies in receipt of public funds and that are using taxpayers' money to fund their operations to ensure they are compliant and that they write back to confirm the practices in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#D00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I know that in 2008 and 2010 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took up this matter.

While that may be the response of the Department it certainly falls way short of what is required with regard to the response that the business people in that locality are asking for.  From looking at the different sites there the response falls far short of what a commercial operator might do in terms of the development of Howth.  There are lots of issues still to be dealt with and we can deal with these issues in the context of the report and raise the fact that there are many other issues at ports around the country of which we are aware.  Although it is in court now, the John Shine case is a typical example of how the State ignores the efforts of a businessman to conduct his business and at the same time to resolve issues.  It is no way to carry on a business, in my view.

The authority has a development remit and a planning role.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall previous hearings into the events surrounding the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg by a joint venture company, in which the authority was a partner.  The failure of the joint venture project resulted in significant losses for the authority, which contributed to very difficult financial challenges and gave rise to a major legal case against the authority.   Against this background, the Government announced its decision in May 2012 to dissolve the authority and transfer its planning and development functions to Dublin City Council.  Legislation will be required to give effect to this decision, and I understand this is being prepared.  The actual dissolution date has not yet been determined, and in the meantime, the authority has a transitional business plan in place to resolve the liabilities of the authority through the liquidation of assets, including the transfer of the relevant infrastructure, and to deal with any remaining litigation.<\/p> <p>  In 2013, the authority disposed of significant investment properties, resulting in a turnover of &euro;21 million, and reported an operating surplus of &euro;2.7 million for the year.  This compared to an operating deficit of &euro;5.7 million in 2012.<\/p> <p>  For 2013, the authority chose to change its accounting policy to show all fixed assets and certain investment assets that were previously held at nil value at their market value.  The 2012 comparatives have been restated to reflect the effect of the change in accounting policy on the prior period.  As a result of this adjustment, the 2012 net assets increased by &euro;5.2 million to &euro;10.2 million.  The 2013 net assets of the authority amounted to &euro;15.2 million.<\/p> <p>  The authority&rsquo;s liabilities decreased from &euro;24.4 million at end 2012 to &euro;12.7 million at end 2013, and this was funded through the proceeds of the sale of investment assets.  The authority continued to sell its investment properties throughout 2014 in order to meet its outstanding liabilities.<\/p> <p>  The 2013 financial statements were certified on the 23 December 2014, and a clear audit opinion was given.  However, on page 16 the audit certificate drew attention to the executive board&rsquo;s compliance statement, which discloses that the authority did not comply with public procurement guidelines in a number of instances.  My office is awaiting draft financial statements for 2014 from the authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I am the acting chief executive of the authority.  I was appointed in March 2014 and I am on secondment from Dublin City Council.  I work with the authority two days per week.  I am joined by my colleague Mr. John Crawley, the authority&rsquo;s financial adviser.  We are here to discuss the 2013 annual report and financial statements and to bring the committee up to date on developments in the authority since we last appeared in February 2014.<\/p> <p>  Last week we submitted a briefing document to the committee, to which we will refer to this morning.  This briefing covers an update on the recommendations in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 77, some details on the authority&rsquo;s financial position, and a report on the future development of the docklands.<\/p> <p>  On 31 May 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to dissolve the authority.<\/p><p>A new council and executive board were appointed in June 2012 to the authority to oversee the transition.   The Minister envisaged that the authority would remain in place for a transitional period.  During that period the authority is required to wind up existing operations, prepare the transition to new arrangements and make recommendations to the Minister on appropriate structures for the future.  These structures should ensure the following: the docklands brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment; that high-value development is maintained and enhanced; that an appropriate fast-track planning regime remains in place; that the local community and the business sector continue to be involved in the regeneration project; and that job creation is facilitated. <\/p><p> In addition, the board has also considered and made recommendations to the Government on how best to achieve the Minister&rsquo;s key objectives for the future regeneration of the docklands in a way that the board considers will build on the positive elements of the authority&rsquo;s legacy in terms of social, physical and economic regeneration.  In this regard, following the Government's decision to wind up the authority but to retain an appropriate fast-track planning framework to complete the docklands project, a strategic development zone designation, SDZ, was proposed by the authority and Dublin City Council.  The Minister designated the city council as the development agency. On 16 May 2014 the SDZ was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is now effective and operational.  Until such time as the authority is dissolved it continues to operate its section 25 planning function alongside the SDZ planning scheme. <\/p><p> The authority&rsquo;s board, executive and council have proposed the creation of a forum under the auspices of the city council to assist it in the regeneration of the docklands area.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht has considered the issue of the wind-up of the authority and in its recently published list of 16 recommendations is supportive of the creation of a consultative forum which we understand will be established on a statutory footing.  The authority has worked with the city council on the best operational model to be used going forward.  A docklands unit has now been established within the city council and is based in the authority&rsquo;s offices in Custom House Quay, ensuring that there continues to be a physical presence in the area to oversee the continued regeneration of the docklands. <\/p><p> A series of key objectives and associated risks were identified to implement the Government decision, as reported on in the 2013 annual statements and these are being addressed and resolved, where possible, in advance of dissolution.  As regards the current status of the authority, the legal mechanism for the wind-up is through a dissolution Act.  The authority has given significant input to the Department on the dissolution Bill which we understand is expected to be dealt with in the Oireachtas legislative programme during the current session.  In terms of wind-up of existing activities, the authority followed two key strategies, namely, the sale of assets to deal with remaining liabilities, where feasible, and the transfer of infrastructure to Dublin City Council.  In light of what I understand are the complexities in drafting some aspects of the dissolution Bill provisions, a new board was put in place from 1 January 2015.  This board is made up of three members from the previous board and five senior executives from the city council. <\/p><p> In summary, since the successful resolution of the Donatex case and the issues surrounding the Irish Glass Bottle site, the finances of the authority have been stabilised from a negative position of nearly &euro;200 million to an expected positive closing position of some millions.  This should be seen in the context of a very challenging legal environment.  A new fast-track planning mechanism has been put in place to support the delivery of 2,600 housing units and up to 366,000 sq. m of commercial property, which in turn will create up to 23,000 new jobs.  In the past week the first planning permission under the new SDZ scheme was granted by Dublin City Council marking the beginning of a new phase in the regeneration of Dublin docklands.   A framework for the local communities' continued involvement in the future regeneration of the docklands has been agreed.  Regarding the mandate given by the Minister to wind up the authority, I am pleased to report the work is almost complete.  My colleague and I are happy to deal with the committee&rsquo;s queries to the best of our knowledge and ability. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Clegg","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Clegg.

We received a statement from a previous chair, Professor Niamh Brennan, on this matter.  Mr. Clegg mentioned the special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding No. 77.  Professor Brennan, to quote one section in summary of what she had to say about her term as chair from 2009 to 2012, wrote:<\/p><blockquote>I think it is a shame that the Dublin Docklands redevelopment project foundered on a single, high-risk, Irish Glass Bottle site throw of the dice, bringing the Docklands development authority from a cash-rich, successful organisation to the brink of insolvency and irretrievable reputational damage.  Irish taxpayers and the local Docklands community deserve better.<\/blockquote> <p>I suppose she is not quite accurate once we go through No. 77, the special report and what Mr. Clegg has said himself in his own report, which he gave to us earlier.  It is clear that there is a total legacy of failure in the operation of the docklands authority from 1997 until roughly 2009.  There were issues of governance, financial matters and internal systems of financial control.  The board itself was not being informed about decisions that were taken; there was seemingly an internal cabal there.  There was a conflict of interests, with the CEO of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority going to Anglo Irish Bank straight from the docklands.<\/p><p>It seems as though the entire planning process was compromised by the development requirements with the result that, as Mr. Clegg says in his final remarks, the authority has now stabilised from a negative position of nearly &euro;200 million to a positive position.  Of course, the glass bottle site was the last throw of the dice and was a total disaster.  Could Mr. Clegg comment on that in the first instance?  What is his opinion on what happened with his predecessors in the job for a start, and on the operation of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority over a ten-year period or a little longer?

Two consultants were engaged because of their previous knowledge in 2013 without any tender process.  These contracts amounted to &euro;116,383.  A third contract amounted to &euro;501,106 in 2013 and was the subject of a restrictive competitive tender process.

The requirement for procuring a financial advisory service arose first in 2010 when the then finance director resigned.  There was an embargo on recruitment in the public service and the authority put out a tender for the provision of financial services.  This was done on three occasions, in May 2010, March 2013 and November 2014.  In each case, Crawley Business Consulting Limited was the successful candidate.<\/p> <p>  The procurement issue relating to March 2013 which is under review in our financial statements was that when the service was put in place, it was expected that the authority would be wound up eight months later.  The dissolution date at that time was November 2013 and any residual unfinished work would be carried over to the successor of the authority.  Due to circumstances beyond our control, the wind-up of the authority was delayed.  This was due to complications regarding significant planning matters.  In 2013, we were faced with the dissolution being extended to June 2014 and the board had to continue the orderly sale of assets and liabilities.  Had the wind-up taken place in November, these activities would have been carried out by the authority's successor. <\/p> <p>  During 2013, there was a greater workload on the authority.  This was when the authority was starting to dispose of its assets and vigorously working to collect moneys owing to it.  At the same time, the authority's staffing went from 15 down to four.  There was more work to be done, the authority was in wind-up mode and the staff were leaving.  Understandably, when staff knew the authority was to be wound up, they sought other jobs.  Therefore, given the short-term extension of the board, the financial services contract was not put out again to tender.  <\/p> <p>  When I came on board in March 2014, the deadline date for dissolution was June 2014 and we were working towards that date.  The wind-up did not take place in June 2014 and the dissolution date was extended to December 2014.  In August, I carried out a review of procurement compliance and put the service out to tender again.  I suppose what occurred is that the authority would have made the decision in 2014 that there would be a wind-up in November so it used a restricted procedure.  In hindsight, there is no doubt the better course of action would have been to go for an EU tender competition and we did that subsequently.  However, we need to look at the context at the time the decision was made in 2013.  The wind-up was to be in November, staff were leaving and there was additional work.  Also, the authority was operating in a complex legal environment.  It defended a &pound;100 million claim, the bankers were going to call in loans, it looked as if its overdraft facility would be withdrawn and it had to negotiate a new overdraft and it had to deal with the complexity of selling assets within the docklands.  This was a complex work environment.

The Deputy referred to three tenders in his question.  One of the other two tenders related to VAT consulting services.  When we commenced the asset disposal programme in mid 2012, we reverted to the previous tax advisors who advised us, on the basis of the authority's records, when we acquired those assets.  In other words, the assets had been acquired over a period of time and we reverted to the previous tax advisors as we did not have in-house VAT experience.  When we went to the tax advisors we had previously procured, we discovered that a key person involved in the advice who had the particular corporate knowledge had left the organisation and set up her own business.<\/p> <p>  We followed the trail to her business.  At the time, we took the view that there were good technical reasons as to why we would operate that contract to a single economic operator.  We acknowledge that best practice was not followed by not putting it out to open tender.  However, we felt there was critical knowledge available and given the short timeframe we had available to sell the assets, we engaged the services of that person.  That person has been engaged to see out the remaining work.  There are no further instructions to be given to that person at this time.  In the event something new arises that is not particular to the past, we have now accessed the DCC tender panel where we can procure VAT services.<\/p> <p>  We had a second contract in regard to ducting networks which had been installed in the authority over the period 2000 to 2008.  A firm was procured for that piece of work.  In or around the time of the economic collapse, the authority put all expenditure on hold, including expenditure on the ducting network.  Unfortunately, the ducting network fell into some financial and operational disrepair as a result.  When I came on board, we took up that issue and reverted to the people who had been running the contract previously and asked them to finish out a piece of work.  We did not put that out to tender at that point because we felt they had the specific corporate knowledge.  Frankly, we did not have the records ourselves to be able to do the work.  Subsequently, when we got it under control, we put it out to tender and it is currently on a short-term tender, pending a strategic decision in conjunction with the SDZ as to what we want to do with ducting networking in the future.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we accept we did not follow best practice, but we were in a particular set of circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Crawley"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Has Mr. Crawley any comment to make on his own case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#H01000","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I was the recipient of that contract, which I tendered for three times over the period in question.

While the authority was an operating authority it accounted for the liability on its own balance sheet.  That is not the norm in the public sector.  Normally in the public sector, pensions are accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The liability is still in the order of &euro;8 million.  On the wind-up of the authority, we started to close out issues of liability, among which were pensions and balance sheet adjustments, which I will refer to  later.  We asked the Department for guidance and it was agreed that pension scheme obligations would be taken over by the State.  Ultimately the decision as to where that is to rest remains outstanding but because it was to be taken over by the State we were no longer going to account for it on our balance sheet and we thus wrote it back.  The State is currently carrying a future pension liability of approximately &euro;8 million, based on the valuation from 2013, which will have to be met at some point in time.  Separately, it appears that the asset position of the authority will be in the order of several millions of euro, possibly as high as &euro;9 million.  As we are a State agency under the auspices of the Department, those proceeds go back to the Department, which will make the decisions on how they should be dealt with in the future.  We are still working with the Department and Dublin City Council, which will take over many of the responsibilities of the authority, to decide exactly where those liabilities will be met and how the assets can be used to fund them.  Approximately &euro;1.1 million of the liability of &euro;8 million will arise in the next five years and a further &euro;1.2 million will arise over the following ten years.  This is because the staff working in the authority were relatively young and, therefore, their deferral dates are quite far into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Crawley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The Department's view is that the liability remains with the State and it is not unreasonable that the assets would be used to fund liabilities.

On the recommendation of the consultant we put fire marshals in place to ensure that a detection process is available in the event of any emergency and that people can be evacuated safely.  In working with the management company, we made sure that communication was entered into with residents.  A letter was sent from the management company to all owners and residents and Dublin Fire Brigade also sent a fire safety leaflet and a fact sheet outlining the key questions.  The next stage of work was the installation of fire alarms.  We have paid for the marshals and the fire alarms, and that work has just been completed.  Our immediate reaction was not to consider the liability issues but to make sure people were safe.  The main issue arising was a deficiency in the fire alarm system, which is in the process of being resolved.  We have put in place a good detection and evacuation process.  The next stage is to examine in detail the remaining deficiencies in each department.  This is a question of compartmentalisation, where fire proofing is done within individual units.

Have there been other deals since then, or are there any in the pipeline at the moment similar to that one?

I was always told that if one gives two excuses, then one does not believe the first one.  If Mr. Crawley says there were competing priorities at the time and that time was being left for people to come in on it, then he does not believe either of them.  The fact it took from the end of 2013 to 2015 to sign over on a deal that is way below market value is quite extraordinary.  Were there secret deals or are there any in the pipeline?

The authority was originally established as the Custom House Docks Development Authority in 1986 and it because the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 1997.  It has been in existence for well over a quarter of a century and its activities have left a very bad taste in the mouths of the members of local communities.  Sheriff Street lies cheek by jowl with the docklands development area, DDA.  There is 100% employment in that area, but in Sheriff Street there is an unemployment rate of over 60%.  The level of community gain has been very limited.  Some &euro;7 million was supposed to be spent on a school but that development never materialised and neither did the local employment charter and the 20% commitment attaching to it.  Can Mr. Clegg indicate how this is going to be rectified in the new strategic development zone?  Many developments occurred during the Celtic tiger period and there are now many iconic buildings, office blocks, etc., in the DDA.  The area is a very desirable location for companies that are seeking to establish operations in the city.  Nevertheless, development there has led to the creation of a ghetto-type situation.  The evidence of this is now more stark than ever, and something must be done in the context of the SDZ to eliminate the poverty and deprivation that exist cheek by jowl with enormous affluence and 100% employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#P02900","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427364000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>As I said in my opening statement in respect of the potential relating to the undeveloped lands, some 23,000 jobs could be created.  Just over 50 acres remain to be developed, and that is why we put in place the strategic development zone, SDZ.  We also have a fast-track planning process in place.  As I pointed out earlier, the first planning permission was granted by Dublin City Council on Friday last.  When one is going to create 23,000 jobs, the trick is how to ensure local employment.  We are going to include a clause in our planning permissions to encourage contractors and developers to work with the city council in order to ensure that we will maximise opportunities for local people.  As we all know, however, this is not enforceable contractually.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the local labour charter, which has been taken on board in the context of the Grangegorman strategic development zone.  The Dublin City Council office in the docklands is seeking to upgrade that local charter.<\/p><p>More importantly, we have engaged quite effectively with the local employment services in Amiens Street and Pearse Street.  We are trying to identify the industries that are coming to the Docklands so that if we know that in two or three years a particular industry will come, the local employment service can contact this industry with a view to establishing its employment needs.  If those employment needs can be catered for within the local employment service's records, good, but if not there is an opportunity to train people.  The local employment services are quite excited about this.  There is an opportunity here to get real, local jobs.  The people to use this are the local employment services.  They are the State bodies.  They are the experts.  We are working very closely with them right from the start.  I am optimistic about this, but local employment charters are not enforceable.  There is real potential if there is close work between us, developers - NAMA is interested in this - and the local employment services to get real local jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015032600002#P03000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Clegg","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Mr. Clegg's commitment to all this, but we had all this for 25 years, virtually.

I welcome everyone to the 17th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.<\/p><p>During our sessions this week we are hearing from a number of witnesses on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead-in to the banking crisis 2002 to 2007 and any changes in approach after the crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. Michael Doorly, former finance director of Independent News and Media, and Mr. Gerry O'Regan, former editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  Specifically, Mr. Regan and Mr. Doorly have been invited to discuss the independence of editorial policy on the economy and property boom and, separately, their newspapers' business model and sources of revenue including that from the real estate sector in the period from 2002 to 2007.<\/p><p>Mr. Doorly is the company secretary of Independent News and Media plc.  He is an experienced senior executive in the group and has held a variety of senior management roles in the subsidiary Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Limited, including that of sales and marketing director, finance director and operations director.  He has also travelled extensively with the group to New Zealand, South Africa and the UK.  Mr. Gerry O'Regan was editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>for seven years from 2005 to 2012.  Prior to that he was editor of <i>The Herald<\/i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>for periods of six years and five years respectively.  Before that he was deputy editor of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and held various other editorial positions on the newspaper.  Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan are welcome before the inquiry.<\/p><p>Before I begin I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  In whatever sequence they wish, I invite Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan to make their opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#A00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427328000,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us.  As the Chairman outlined, I was editor of the<i>Irish Independent<\/i>for a period of seven years from 2005 to 2012, and I was previously editor of <i>The Herald<\/i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star<\/i>for a total of 11 years.<br\/><br\/>I am qualified to discuss the editorial policy of the newspaper during my period as editor, rather than matters such as advertising revenue streams.  The established policy and practice of strict separation of the editorial and advertising functions meant I was solely responsible for editorial direction.  Under line management systems, other executives were accountable for commercial activities such as advertising.  Correspondence on behalf of the committee states it wishes to specifically discuss &quot;editorial policy on the economy and the property boom (2002-2007)&quot;.  <\/p>  <p>         By way of background and context, I think it should be noted that the overall role of an independent media in a free society is both complicated and nuanced, depending on events and circumstances.  However, my essential point in relation to editorial policy, particularly with regard to economic coverage, is that there was no conscious attempt on my part, or on the part of the newspaper, to fuel what has been described as the property boom.  It would be wrong, I think, to retrospectively arrive at definitive conclusions regarding the coverage of the economy and the property market on the basis of subsequent events and evidence which was not then but is now in the public domain.<br\/><br\/>The ever-changing dynamic which is a mass-selling daily newspaper requires sophisticated analysis when it comes to assessing editorial coverage on a particular issue.  As the biggest-selling daily newspaper in the country, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>has a wide and multilayered readership base.  These demographics, by definition, continue to evolve.  The primary objective of an editor is to try to cater for such readership requirements by marrying statistical data and social trends with editorial instinct.  The roadmap for editing, therefore, by definition, remains constantly subject to change, depending on changing events.<br\/><br\/>Coverage of the economy and related matters, such as the property market, is a key part of the journalistic remit of a paper like the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  However, such coverage cannot be conducted in an intellectual vacuum, and editors, writers, contributors and analysts cannot but be influenced by the prevailing climate at a given point in time.  Certainly, up to and including 2007, the overwhelming consensus both domestically and abroad was that Ireland had transformed itself economically.  The country had by then enjoyed a number of years of unparalleled prosperity, manifest most of all in historically low unemployment rates and a period of net immigration for the first time in the history of the State.<br\/><br\/>It is important to give cognisance to the economic context and background in which media reporting and commentary we are now discussing took place.  It was obviously done within the parameters of knowledge at that particular point in time.  Certain objective data statistics and facts have to be taken into account when we look back at the period we are now reassessing.  The facts show the economy grew strongly from 2002 and this continued in 2007.  National debt was among the lowest in the developed world at 25% of GDP.  The country's fiscal performance was outstanding and employment levels were at heights never seen before in Ireland.  All of these factors led to a powerful so-called &quot;national feel-good factor''.  Ongoing reporting and analysis of economic and related matters continued against this background.  Central to some of the arguments being considered by the committee is that editorial work had to be carried out within the framework of known events and facts at that particular time.<br\/><br\/>The overwhelming consensus was that, despite the rapid growth of the construction industry and the ongoing rise in house prices, the essential pillars of our economy were sound.  The prevailing wisdom was that if a property bubble was to emerge, the country's still high employment figures and positive Government finances would mitigate against a serious economic downturn.  Hence the widespread belief in the financial, economic and political communities that a ''soft landing'' would result from the rapid expansion of the property and construction sectors over the previous number of years.  It is important to note also that this was the prevailing economic consensus abroad, particularly at EU level, and the approach to Irish fiscal and economic strategies by various reputable international organisations could be described as removed and benign, seemingly on the presumption that the fundamentals of our economy were sound.<br\/><br\/>As we now know, however, and as has so often happened in similar circumstances throughout economic history, underlying trends were gathering pace which would have serious negative implications for Ireland.  Clouds were gathering in the international financial world and the storm that erupted in 2008 led to a global financial crisis, which had profound economic and fiscal consequences for the economies of both the USA and Europe, and particularly for those on the periphery of things, such as Ireland.  In time, such developments would have profound consequences, particularly for our own banking structure.<br\/><br\/>The consequences for the Irish economy have been well documented, but for the period I have been asked to comment on, 2002 to 2007, the full import of a changing economic landscape worldwide was still in the future, and, as such, could not completely inform editorial coverage in the newspaper.  My predominant objective as editor was to optimise the circulation of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  By definition, in an intensely competitive environment, this meant embracing and encouraging wide-ranging and diverse views in its editorial content.  Daily newspapers articulate and reflect various dimensions of what has been described as &quot;the national conversation&quot; at any particular point in time.  Sometimes, of course, the predictions and assertions by some commentators about possible future trends may prove to be incorrect, but that really is intrinsic to the very essence of journalism, including economic forecasting.<br\/><br\/>The ultimate safety valve for the maintenance of editorial standards in a newspaper is the perception and understanding of its readers.  They can be influenced in making the ultimate choice, and it is a very grim choice for any editor - they can decide to stop buying the paper - if they believe certain editorial standards are not being met.  For all media, including newspapers, the consumer is the ultimate judge and jury.  For this and other reasons, which I hope will emerge in the discussion to follow, there was no hidden agenda in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>to try to artificially bolster the property market for the period under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Thank you.

During the period which is the subject of the committee's inquiry, I was finance director of Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited, which is the Irish subsidiary of Independent News and Media plc.  At the outset I would like to briefly address the subject of the role of the media from a commercial perspective.  It is generally accepted that one of the lynchpins of a democratic society is a free press which operates on an independent basis.  It follows that, in order to establish and maintain independence, media enterprises must be financially sustainable and capable of survival in a commercial and competitive environment.  In seeking to achieve this, the print media has two core sources of income: these are revenue from the sales of its publications and revenues from advertising.  Both income streams are vital and there is an interdependence between them.<\/p>  <p>  The reality, of course, is that the publication is the core product which, through the quality of its content and its success in building circulation, sales and readership, creates a channel for advertisers to promote their goods and services.  Advertising revenues are, therefore, a factor of the reputation and integrity of a publication, which is built through good reporting and good journalism, and content that is relevant to its readership.  The requirement to maintain and build on this editorial integrity underpins Independent News and Media's policy of a strict and absolute separation of the editorial and commercial functions within the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  The committee of inquiry has requested me to address a number of matters, including the company's business model and sources of revenue, including revenue from the real estate sector.  They have asked me to address the importance of property-related revenues within the overall revenue mix, the group's engagement in property-related commercial activity and the relationship between the editorial and sales functions.  <\/p>  <p>         The committee will understand that the company, as a commercial organisation operating in a highly competitive industry, is not in a position to disclose detailed financial figures that would be of potential benefit, and certainly of interest, to our competitors.  However, I will attempt to deal with the issues in a manner that provides the committee with substantive information which will meet its requirements.<br\/><br\/>Referring to the business model, Independent News and Media is the largest media operation on the island of Ireland.  It is also a public limited company.  The group has a strong portfolio of national, regional and local print titles, including the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, which is the market leader among the dailies, and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, Ireland&rsquo;s biggest-selling Sunday newspaper.  The production and distribution of newspapers is a complex operation, but in the business sense it is quite simple: we sell newspapers and we sell advertising.<br\/><br\/>Referring to sources of income, newspaper revenues are derived from two sources: circulation sales and advertising revenues.  Between 2002 and 2007 Ireland was a country in the throes of a major economic boom.  GDP grew strongly in each of those years and newspaper sales and advertising revenues enjoyed increases broadly in line with the economy.  Over the period, the revenues of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>increased by an average of 6.5% per annum.  This is a total of 37.6%.  I wish to correct the figure of 31.7% presented in my written submission.  Advertising revenues increased by an average of 9% per annum, or 52% over the period.  Circulation sales increased by an average of 3% per annum, or 17% during the period.  This is not surprising in an economy in which personal consumption was growing at an average rate of almost 5% a year.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the revenue mix, in 2002, 60% of overall revenues came from advertising, with the remaining 40% coming from circulation.  By 2007, 66% of overall revenues came from advertising, with 34% coming from circulation.  This movement is not insignificant, but neither could it be described as a paradigm shift.<br\/><br\/>Referring to the importance of property-related advertising in the overall revenue mix, it is clear that the demand for advertising space to promote housing developments increased throughout the period under review.  The increase was in line with the scale of activity in the residential property market, where house completions increased by an average of 13% per annum, from 57,695 units in 2002 to just over 93,000 units in 2006.<br\/><br\/>From a relatively low base, property-related revenues in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>grew by a similar 13% per annum, or a quantum of 89% over the period.  For reference purposes, it is worth noting that advertising of travel increased by 25% per annum throughout this period, or a quantum of 153%.  Revenues from property-related advertising represented an average of 14% of total advertising income and accounted for just over 9% of overall income - that is, income including both circulation sales and advertising revenues.<br\/><br\/>In his submission, my former colleague Gerry O'Regan gave an insight into the role of the media during the economic boom and subsequent crash.  The only comment I will add, specifically concerning the property market, is that the media, in my view, cannot create or sustain a boom.  Demand for property is created by a mix of factors over which the media have no control.  These include overall economic conditions, employment levels, consumer confidence, the availability of finance, demographics, the rate of home formation, and society's capacity for risk.<br\/><br\/>In relation to information sought concerning engagement in property-related commercial activity, I can advise the committee that INM did not engage in property development activities and was at no stage a participant in the property industry.  I would like to add, however, that as part of our normal operations the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>did relocate its printing business from Abbey Street in Dublin city centre to Citywest in Dublin 24 and relocated its publishing division to Talbot Street in Dublin 1 in 2004.  This was in line with other publishers in moving printing facilities out of what were congested city centre areas.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the relationship between the editorial and sales functions, Mr. O'Regan and I have outlined the position concerning the complete separation of the editorial and commercial functions within our organisation.  I thank the Chairman and I hope my comments are of assistance to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doorly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan for their opening statements.

The balance that the Chairman referred to is therefore weighted towards the newspaper, and this is the domain of the editor and is separate from the commercial functions.

I signed him up to write for the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>when I was ten weeks into the job.  He joined on 22 December, we both went off and enjoyed our Christmases and he started to write everything that he saw fit from early in 2006.

I have an extract from the newspaper edition of 4 July 2007 when Brendan Keenan was responding to the statements made by Morgan Kelly.  He wrote in the context of an ESRI survey:<\/p><blockquote><font color=\"#111111\">Actually, there is a bigger danger; that the property market - rather than having a soft landing or a bumpy landing - crashes and burns.  This was the scenario outlined in the ESRI quarterly bulletin by UCD economist Morgan Kelly.<\/font><font color=\"#111111\">Although it was contained in the bulletin, it was not part of the ESRI forecast.  That predicts a soft landing, with house building falling 10pc over the 18 months, and house prices stabilising after a 3pc fall this year.  Prof Kelly takes a different view.  Based on property booms and busts in different countries over the past 40 years, an Irish crash could knock up to 60pc off the real (after inflation) price of houses over the next 10 years, he says.  The first thing to be said about Prof Kelly's scenario is that it\u00a0<\/font><i><font color=\"#111111\">could<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#111111\"> happen.<\/font><\/blockquote>  <p><font color=\"#111111\">In other words, it could lead to a massive property crash.

In terms of new media and some structural changes that were beginning to take place in the market, the group was developing a strategy of involving itself in developing websites in news, business and sport, but also classified advertising.

It is in the context of that structural change, moving from a dependence on newspapers alone into new media, that that purchase was made.

Among the awards was Irish investor of the year, Irish developer of the year, international property achievement, Irish commercial development of the year, Irish property personality of the year and residential development of the year.  Of those glittering awards, in 2007, the Irish property deal of the year was the Irish Glass Bottle site which cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions.  Seven of the award winners ended up in NAMA, five of whom were among the top ten debtors to Anglo Irish Bank, which cost the taxpayer billions of euro.

I welcome Ms Donovan and Ms Kennedy who have been invited to discuss <i>The Irish Times<\/i>' editorial policy on the economy and the property boom and, separately, the newspaper's business model and sources of revenue, including that from the real estate sector during that period.  Ms Donovan joined the newspaper from ICC Bank in 1977.  She held a number of senior management roles in the company before being appointed managing director of The Irish Times Trust Limited in 2007.  She retired in 2010.  She holds an MSc from Trinity College Dublin and has served as chairperson of NNI, the newspaper industry representative body.  She has been a director of the International Newspaper Marketing Association, INMA, and served in the European national newspaper group of the World Association of Newspapers.  She is also a director of the Children's Medical &amp;amp; Research Foundation, the fund-raising board for Crumlin hospital and the National Children's Research Centre.<\/p><p>Ms Kennedy was appointed editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in October 2002, the first woman to hold the post in the history of the newspaper, and retired in June 2011.  She has covered politics for <i>The Sunday Tribune<\/i>, <i>The Sunday Press<\/i>and<i>The Irish Times<\/i>for most of her career.  She was a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann between 1987 and 1989 when she served as spokesperson on foreign affairs and Northern Ireland for the Progressive Democrats Party and in the role of Chief Whip.

I am speaking as the former editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  I retired in June 2011, having been appointed editor in October 2002.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, I was asked to address the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007; the approach to reporting on the property market and the economy; and the contribution of the media to public understanding and debate around fiscal-budgetary policies and their implications.  I have also been asked to cover the business model and sources of revenue.  I will deal with that issue later.<br\/><br\/>I will be as helpful as I can in answering the committee's questions.  In the limited time given to me to prepare this submission I have been unable to review every single aspect of the newspaper&rsquo;s coverage in news, analysis, comment, opinion page, letters to the editor, etc.  I have been asked to account for coverage over six years - 52 weeks a year, six editions per week, adding up to 1,872 publication days.  It was impossible for me to read and review all of the material in every single issue of<i>The Irish Times<\/i>published in that period and I hope the committee will understand this.  Unfortunately, the archive does not easily facilitate such a detailed analysis.<br\/><br\/>By way of introduction, I should, first, provide some background on how <i>The Irish Times<\/i>operates since it may be helpful in our discussion.  Unlike most other newspapers, it is owned by a trust.  There are only a handful of newspapers owned by trusts in the world today.  The main object of The Irish Times Trust Limited and the company which manages and operates the newspaper, The Irish Times Limited, is &quot;to publish <i>The Irish Times<\/i>as an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland free from any form of personal or of party political, commercial, religious or other control&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The memorandum and articles of association set out the policy principles of the newspaper: the support of constitutional democracy through governments fairly elected; the progressive achievement of social justice between people and the discouragement of discrimination of all kinds; the promotion of a society where the quality of life is enriched by the standards of its education, its art, its culture, and its recreational facilities, and where the quality of spirit is instinct with Christian values but free from all religious bias and discrimination; the promotion of peace and tolerance and opposition to all forms of violence and hatred so that each man may live in harmony with his neighbour - I presume they intended women to be involved also - considerate for his cultural, material and spiritual needs; and the promotion of understanding of other nations and peoples and a sympathetic concern for their well-being.<br\/><br\/>The objects of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>require that, in its journalism, news shall be as accurate and comprehensive as is practicable and be presented fairly; comment and opinion shall be informed and responsible, and shall be identifiable from fact; and that special consideration shall be given to the reasonable representation of minority interests and divergent views.  I have appended a copy of the memorandum and articles of association for the committee's perusal.<br\/><br\/>From the above, the committee can see that <i>The Irish Times<\/i>has an unusual structure where the managing director and the editor each report independently to the board.  It is designed to ensure the effective management of the newspaper&rsquo;s strategic and commercial functions and the independence of the editor, working within the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy.  There is a partnership of equals with different responsibilities.  It seems appropriate, therefore, that I address  section 1 of the committee's questions and the former managing director, Ms Maeve Donovan, section 2 because of our separate roles.<br\/><br\/>I was asked to address the context of the banking crisis.  Let me put the reporting of the economy and the property market in the context of some of the other major news events at home and abroad that we covered in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>between 2002 and 2007 because we were not single-mindedly looking at the property market or the state of the economy.  During that period there were two general elections; the invasion of Iraq; the introduction of the euro; changes in the leadership of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna F&aacute;il;  ten new members of the European Union; Mary McAleese&rsquo;s election as President; the deaths of Pope John Paul II, Liam Lawlor and Charles J. Haughey;  the historic meeting between Dr. Ian Paisley and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in Dublin, just to mention a few events.  There was also<i>The Irish Times<\/i>story in September 2006 that the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, was receiving moneys from businessmen while he was Minister for Finance, which was to lead to the newspaper&rsquo;s appearance before the Mahon tribunal and costly challenges in the High Court and the Supreme Court to establish the journalistic right to protect sources.  I have supplied an appendix giving more detail of the types of issue that would have preoccupied an editor at the time.<br\/><br\/>However, admittedly with the benefit of hindsight, the boom and bust in the economy were the major event that spanned all of these years and had most impact on the lives of the people.  <\/p>  <p>         Editorial policy, by definition, is found in the leaders that express the views of the newspaper as determined by, or on behalf of, the editor every day.  I was able in the limited time available to review the editorials and leaders published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>over the 1,872 editions that are the subject of this inquiry.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>wrote 289 leaders expressing editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007.  They were a major issue of concern in the editorial columns in those years.  There were 38 leading articles in 2002, 73 in 2003, 56 in 2004, 52 in 2005, 31 in 2006 and 39 in 2007.<br\/><br\/>I am taking a narrow view of what the committee means by the economy and the property boom.  Throughout those years, it is fair to say that the policy of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>was critical of both the establishment and operation of the Financial Regulator and IFSRA, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, believing they were not independent of the Central Bank.  The newspaper was concerned about the erosion of competitiveness and critical of benchmarking in the determination of public sector pay, cautious about the banks&rsquo; lending policies and the scale of the property market.  As an aside, the chairman of the board of The Irish Times Limited was the Financial Regulator between 2002 and 2008.  I have attached an appendix on editorial policy on the economy and the property boom.<br\/><br\/>From 2003 onwards, the newspaper was warning that trends in the mortgage market were a cause for concern.  This policy was consistently expressed in editorials in the following years.  By way of illustration, in 2006, the newspaper was calling on the Central Bank and the then Government to analyse the risks the property market posed to future financial stability in an article &ldquo;Rate change cause for moderation&rdquo; on 3 March.  In case I could be accused of being selective, I am presenting all editorials to the committee for its perusal.  I have also written a short summary of the policy positions relevant to the banking inquiry.<br\/><br\/>In their book, <i>The Fall of the Celtic Tiger: Ireland and the Euro Debt Crisis<\/i>, the authors Donal Donovan and Antoin E. Murphy identified four separate but related crises that resulted in the collapse of the Irish economy which required an international financial rescue.  These were, first, a property crash as the housing price bubble burst; second, a banking collapse where banks carrying too many non-performing property loans had their solvency questioned; third, fiscal failure as the economy contracted and tax revenue from property collapsed leading to the fourth crisis, sovereign debt.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>covered all four crises in detail as these stories unfolded in stages over the years to the best of its ability.  The coverage involved detailed news and analysis by reporters, specialist correspondents in the finance and business fields and the economic editors of that decade.  In effect, Simon Carswell became a full-time specialist in covering the banking crisis.  Extra resources and pagination were provided to the newspaper during this period.  In addition to reporting, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>commissioned articles about the banking crisis and the property market from specialists and noted academic economists.  Its opinion pages were the platform for divergent views and public debate that often set the agenda and contributed to the national debate.<br\/><br\/><i>The Irish Times<\/i>was the only newspaper to publish the article by Morgan Kelly, professor of economics in University College Dublin, predicting there would be a property crash with prices falling by between 40% and 60%.  The first article was carried on 28 December 2006.  Two others were carried subsequently.  Other noted contributors to the debate in the newspaper included the current Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, then professor in Trinity College Dublin, Professors Karl Whelan and Ray Kinsella, both University College Dublin, Brian Lucey, lecturer in finance, Trinity College Dublin, and Alan Ahearne, professor of economics, National University of Ireland, Galway.  He later became an adviser to the late Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Finance.<br\/><br\/>The same editorial standards applied in the property supplements as elsewhere in the newspaper.  There was no trade-off between editorial and advertising.  Advertising features were clearly signposted.  Advertisers did not write editorial copy.  We never carried advertorials in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  The newspaper had occasion late in 2007 to make a complaint to the professional bodies of auctioneers and valuers that some estate agents were providing the property supplement with misleading selling prices.  The newspaper took the view that if agents were unwilling to supply accurate information or if the vendors were reluctant to disclose the true selling price, then it would be damaging to the credibility of the newspaper to carry the results.  The introduction of the national property register in 2012 was a consequence of this discovery and disclosure in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>This review of editorial policy and the approach to reporting on the property boom in the run-up to the banking crisis proved to be an interesting exercise for me.  I was challenged to consider whether in my then role as editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>journalists could or should have foreseen the multifaceted nature of the financial crisis, including the property crash and the banking collapse.  I do not know what we could have done differently to put ourselves in the position to predict the magnitude of the fall.  We reported the news forensically.  We challenged the consensus and canvassed all views and published them.  The media, as always, were reliant on reporting the views of the specialists, be they Government, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator or the profession of economists.  Journalists were less well-placed than others to make an accurate assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kennedy.

As my colleague Geraldine Kennedy addressed the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy in the period in question, I will attempt to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions on the company, its business model, property-related commercial activity and the editorial-commercial relationship.<br\/><br\/><i>The Irish Times<\/i>newspaper is published by The Irish Times Limited and its controlling shareholder is The Irish Times Trust Limited.  The Irish Times Limited exists to publish <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It is prohibited from providing dividends to its shareholders.  Accordingly, all profits are retained in the company.  The Irish Times Trust Limited has certain powers under the memorandum and articles to appoint and remove directors of The Irish Times Limited, to call general meetings and the control of significant acquisitions and disposals.  The primary role of the trust is to appoint a board which it believes will ensure the company is well run and adheres to its core objects.  Thereafter, the trust leaves the board to get on with it.  The board has the responsibility of adhering to the main object concerning the quality and independence of <i>The Irish Times.<\/i>The trust acts a second guarantor or long stop, a responsibility grounded in the trust as a whole.<br\/><br\/>Editorial policy at <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is the responsibility of the board of The Irish Times Limited.  In practical terms, day-to-day policy is executed by the editor and team in the context of the memorandum and articles of the company.  The core requirement is trust, integrity and balance.  As managing director, I had no input into day to day editorial decisions.  The managing director is, however, responsible for the overall viability, performance and development of the business, including responsibility for strategy.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the business model and sources of revenue 2002 to 2007, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>business model is a traditional one in the quality newspaper sector in Europe and elsewhere.  News gathering and all ancillary activities are funded by a combination of cover price and newspaper sales revenue, subscription revenue and advertising revenue, both print and digital.  During the inquiry&rsquo;s reference period, growing revenues derived from printing external publications.  The latter commenced in 2002 with the commissioning of the company&rsquo;s new printing plant at Citywest.  The ratio of advertising to circulation revenue was typically 60:40 on average.  This moved up and down depending on the state of the economy.  Key advertising sectors, particularly for quality newspaper titles, are property, recruitment, general classifieds including motors and display or run-of-paper advertising.  <\/p>  <p>         The classifieds include cars and small ads in various categories.  The run-of-paper advertising is largely about retail, food, financial services and so on.<br\/><br\/>During the reference period, the steady advance of digital media, and hence digital advertising, was a key strategic challenge for the company. This remains the case for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and indeed all print media, as the pace of digital adoption continues to increase.<br\/><br\/>On the importance of property-related revenues to the overall revenue mix, property is a key pillar of the newspaper&rsquo;s publishing revenue.  The commercial property supplement in Wednesday&rsquo;s newspaper and the residential property supplement on Thursday are important to readers as well as advertisers.  The readers of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>have a strong interest in both residential and commercial property.  They are buyers for both categories and many are also property investors.  In addition to the dedicated supplements, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>also provides extensive coverage on homes, interiors and related lifestyle content.  In an overall context, therefore, property is a key driver of readership both print and online for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  From an advertising perspective, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>'s audience is of particular interest to companies trading in the sector.  This has been the case for decades and certainly through my entire period at the newspaper.  The company&rsquo;s acknowledged success in the property advertising market has attracted new domestic and UK players into this market and into the sector.<br\/><br\/>When I came to work for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in 1977, it was the market leader in the property sector.  That position was maintained through the 1980s and 1990s, through the reference period, and it continues today.  Through the decades there have been new market entrants in both print and digital formats.  The market is highly competitive and highly diversified.  Globally, the long-standing success of newspapers in the pillar categories of property and recruitment is what gave rise, in large part, to the arrival of standalone digital websites and the resulting disruption of the newspaper&rsquo;s commercial model.<br\/><br\/>During the reference period, the company sought to balance increasing exposure to the property sector through a range of diverse activities.  The most notable of these was the development of strong external printing revenues from the Citywest plant.<br\/><br\/>The relationship between the editorial and commercial functions is clearly drawn in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Irish Times Trust.  It specifies that editorial content in the newspaper shall be &quot;free from any form of personal or party political, commercial religious or other sectional control&quot;.  That separation is carefully maintained under the stewardship of both the trust and the board.  This requirement of the company is deeply embedded in the company's culture.  It is heavily emphasised from the induction of new staff onwards, and it is fundamental to the way in which the company operates.<br\/><br\/>At a macro level, everybody in the organisation understands the importance of advertising to the enterprise.  At the micro level, all staff, both editorial and commercial, are aware of the necessity of maintaining the separation of editorial and commercial activities.  Customers of the business are also very much aware of this.  This does not mean that clients do not sometimes complain, but the role of the business team, especially its management, is to act as a buffer between commercial interests and the producers of editorial content.  This practice is regarded within the company as a key asset, and the independence of the newspaper is emphatically stressed when the newspaper is marketed to clients.  It is one of the key differentiators of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>within the Irish newspaper sector.<br\/><br\/>On engagement in property-related commercial activity, during the reference period <i>The Irish Times<\/i>engaged in two notable transactions.  The first was the purchase of the website <i>myhome.ie<\/i>.  As early as the late 1990s, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>sought to secure its position in key markets as revenue started to migrate from print to digital media.  Standalone classified sites had started to proliferate, particularly in Europe and the USA.  Obtaining a market-leading property site in the sector became a key strategic objective for the company and, hence, for the management team.  Along the way, the company developed several digital iterations in the property sector.  We had <i>ireland.com\/property<\/i>, and owned the ireland.com portal at that time.  We also had <i>irishtimesproperty.com<\/i>and <i>nicemove.ie<\/i>.  Despite considerable investment and marketing activity, none of these sites proved to be viable competition for <i>myhome.ie<\/i>, which was the market leader and had grown exponentially from its launch in 2000.  Therefore, our company&rsquo;s intentions turned to growth by acquisition.  The <i>myhome.ie<\/i>business became available for sale in 2006.  The Irish Times Limited retained NCB as an adviser for the bidding process.  There was a competitive process with at least two other bidders involved.  The acquisition was unanimously approved by the board of The Irish Times Limited and the transaction was approved by the shareholder, the Irish Times Trust.  The website became part of the Irish Times Group and today it remains a key strategic asset of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and trades profitably.  <i>The Irish Times <\/i>has a strong position in both print and digital media in a sector which has substantial revenue streams, which will help to protect the title into the future.  Successfully making the migration from print to digital is essential to the survival of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and indeed to all print media.<br\/><br\/>The second transaction was the sale of the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street premises and the leasing of the Irish Times building in Tara Street from Dublin City Council.  During 2005 and 2006, the company had been examining changing work practices and creating an appropriate environment for a changing business.  Various options were examined, including extensive remodelling of its listed buildings in D&rsquo;Olier Street.  The cost of redevelopment was prohibitive and inevitably required compromising on the space requirements.  Therefore, the decision was made to seek modern accommodation within the city centre, proximate to key sites such as the D&aacute;il.  A suitable property was identified and the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street buildings were sold in 2007.  The company transferred operations to Liffey House in Tara Street, a facility which was much more suitable for the development of the newspaper and a range of digital business interests.  The price achieved, &euro;29.1 million, was considerably higher than the company had anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":981,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms Donovan.

I would not be doing an editorial in the interest of the banks but in the interests of our readers and taxpayers.  I basically said that if he had any issue with that we could have a discussion on the board about it.

He must have been told that the editor had pulled it.  Then, the next time he wanted to put in an ad he wrote directly to me and put it to me that I would be making the decision anyway.

The starting premise for a discussion of RTE's editorial policy on any area of public interest is that there is no single expression of it.  RTE's output is based on a set of principles which are derived from its statutory obligations.  These principles form the framework for editorial decision-making, and there is an editorial structure in place to monitor, discuss and challenge the editorial selections being made to ensure these principles are adhered to.  In RTE News this translates into a very simple premise: inform the audience in the public interest.<\/p>  <p>  The political scientist, Jean Blondel, in an essay written in honour of the late RTE broadcaster, Brian Farrell, calls the role to inform \"the noblest of tasks\" because it is the most difficult.  It requires the reporting of facts, sometimes the establishment of facts, their selection according to their importance and the presentation of them with related material to allow their meaning or significance to be understood.  Referring to a concept of a national consensus, Brian Farrell himself described it as a living, flexible and loose set of shared ways of looking and ordering experience, constantly adjusting to and affected by the changes that these experiences represent.  He agreed that the whole concept of a free press in a free society supposes that any established or emergent ideology should be constantly open to challenge and criticism.<\/p>  <p>  This is the basis for judging how RTE and other media performed their functions in the period under scrutiny.  Did it live up to this responsibility to inform?  Did it strive to establish the important facts in the rapidly changing environment?  Did it provide vigilance and challenge to assist understanding?  It is my personal view that RTE performed its public service role well in the period under discussion.  Could we have done better?  Of course we could.<\/p>  <p>  An expression of RTE&rsquo;s view of its obligations is found in its vision mission values statement: to inform and to connect with the lives of all the people and deliver the most trusted, independent Irish news service, accurate and impartial, for the connected age.  The Broadcasting Acts are explicit in their requirement of news to be &ldquo;reported and presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the broadcaster&rsquo;s own views\".  RTE's public service statement specifically requires it to remain independent of any vested interest.  RTE prepares an annual series of commitments based on these principles and strategic objectives.  It reports on these in its annual report.  This forms part of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's review of RTE activities.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure the delivery of these basic principles RTE has developed a series of journalism guidelines.  In my written statement I have gone into detail on the structures which deliver and monitor content.  There is no single editorial vision when it comes to RTE content.  For news, story selection has a variety of editorial inputs throughout the day, particularly from the specialist correspondents.  For programmes, each unit makes its own independent selection of what to feature, often in competition with other RTE output.  This process is overseen by an editorial conference structure that in my experience allows, and often encourages, editorial debate and challenge.  It is a structure which operates in a legal and compliance framework, requiring it to be vigilant of its responsibilities and to respond to complaints, representations and legal challenge promptly.  It is a structure with clear lines of editorial responsibility.  I can only speak subjectively about how RTE performed during the period.  <\/p>  <p>         There has been little or no authoritative objective media analysis that I have seen that assists any other approach.<\/p> <p> It is worth remembering that there is a vast amount of material in the regular news bulletins and other current affairs programmes.  The two main correspondents in news have nearly 2,000 reports logged to them in television alone for this period and \"Prime Time\" did 120 programmes from 2000 to 2008 on the subject matter of this inquiry, with a third of those on property.  I am also conscious of something highlighted by Peter Lunn in an interesting paper on decision making biases in the banking crisis.  It is called \"hindsight bias\" and is defined as a \"tendency to perceive an event as more predictable than it actually was, and to overestimate the degree to which we actually did predict it\".<\/p> <p> Most of the key moments or statements we remember from the crisis period were probably seen or heard on RTE programming, from Charlie McCreevy's budget in 2002 with its supports for the property market to Brian Lenihan announcing the guarantee or Patrick Honohan confirming the bailout on \"Morning Ireland\".  Throughout this period, in RTE news we were just reporting what was happening.  That was our job.  We followed events as they happened and tried to ask the right questions about them.  We were also open to including in our coverage, and to give prominence to, what the inquiry is calling \"the contrarian view\".  Indeed, because of our questioning approach, mandated by the principles I outlined earlier, some of our coverage was classed as being contrarian.  Certainly, our economics editor would have been put in that category during the period by other media outlets.<\/p> <p> We gave great prominence to the European Commission warning of 2001 and the Government's rejection of it.  Each of the ESRI reports outlined by Professor FitzGerald in his testimony that warned of the imbalance in the economy and the need to introduce counter-cyclical measures was covered by RTE.  We covered all Central Bank reports and reports on the Irish economy by the OECD and IMF.  There was extensive coverage of the continued rise in house prices, the change in lending policy, the construction boom and the relationship between bankers and developers.  From 2007, there was a particular focus on Anglo Irish Bank, which extended to all of the banks following the share price drama of St. Patrick's Day in 2008.  Each shift in Government economic policy received detailed scrutiny, including in the elections of 2002 and particularly 2007.<\/p> <p> George Lee's documentary \"Boom\" in June 2006 was particularly significant, not just for his provocative statement on the death of the Celtic tiger but particularly for his analysis of personal indebtedness, the dependence of the economy on property-related Exchequer funding and employment, and the real possibility that there could be a property crash.  The analysis done for \"Boom\" informed George Lee's reporting from then on, and contributed to an alertness to these issues across our output.  Richard Curran's \"Future Shock\" programme in April 2007 was another key programme.  It was followed by a debate on \"Prime Time\" between Morgan Kelly and Jim Power on soft and hard landings and led to a period of sustained criticism of RTE, including a number of formal complaints.<\/p> <p> There was a journalistic awareness that Anglo Irish Bank should be watched as a story from the initial share price wobble in 2007.  In January 2008, for example, there was some controversy about a story David Murphy ran about stockbrokers recommending that clients sell Anglo Irish Bank and AIB shares.  The Northern Rock crisis, with queues at the Dublin offices, brought an awareness that international turbulence could have implications for institutions here.<\/p> <p> The collapse of Lehman Brothers saw a major shift in the story.  From then to the arrival of the troika, it was continuous coverage.  As well as the pressure to be accurate in our reporting and analysis, there was the added dimension that what we were reporting could impact on events, as there was an international focus on what was happening here.  An example of this was the concerns of the Minister for Finance about the impact of a \"Liveline\" programme which featured callers talking about removing their money from institutions.  When contacted about this, our response in RTE news was to say it was not our role to provide assurances or to stop reporting something we knew was happening, but that if the Governor of the Central Bank or the regulator wanted to say something we would certainly get it on the \"Nine O'Clock News\".  One of the more detailed contributions during the period shortly after the guarantee was Patrick Honohan's Michael Littleton memorial lecture on Radio 1 on 2 December.  In it he stated his analysis that unlimited guarantees add to the cost of the crisis and that where illiquidity is obvious there is usually a deal of insolvency lurking in the background.<\/p> <p> If there was a gap in coverage, it was the solvency versus liquidity issue in the main banks.  Although the issue was raised, most notably by Morgan Kelly, there was little evidence from within the institutions until the information from the stress tests started to be revealed.  Had we been able to discover this type of information from within the banking institutions we would have reported it.  Certainly, it would not have been an easy matter given the legal environment.  In the past RTE had fought cases in the Supreme Court to defend the right of the media to continue investigations into wrongdoing in the financial sector, and we would have again.  When we had undisclosed information such as that revealed in David Murphy's story on Irish Life and Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank end of year arrangements we reported it.  However, there were no whistleblowers.  Even when \"Prime Time Investigates\" went back to the issue in the \"Meet the Bankers\" investigation only one could be found.<\/p> <p> There are other areas which I believe could have been explored further.  We, like other media, tended to struggle to report on regulatory and administrative structures.  Second, there could have been a greater emphasis on the interlocking of the financial structures and the implications of this for policy responses to the crisis.<\/p> <p> The inquiry has asked me about the relationship between the editorial and sales functions within RTE.  In my experience as managing director of news and current affairs, there is none.  When RTE was restructured into integrated business divisions in 2002, with devolved finance, commercial, press and human resources functions, the news and current affairs independent business division, IBD, was kept separate from any commercial activity.  My only contact with the commercial division would be as a member of the executive board, and the only times we would have been consulted on a commercial issue would be on sponsorship options related to content position within news programming, such as weather and traffic.  I have no recollection of any representations or even queries from the commercial side of RTE on an editorial matter and none concerning the subject matter of this inquiry.<\/p> <p> The period under review was a time of intense interest in news and current affairs, an interest which grew as the economic crisis developed.  The coverage and reporting I have been outlining were not isolated incidents in specialist publications.  They were all contained on high audience, mainstream programming.  We also know what the audience thought of this coverage.  In 2008, 79% of a national sample of the RTE audience considered economic coverage of a high quality, with a similar figure for business coverage.  The quality of the coverage is due to the expertise and diligence of the RTE staff working in this area and their commitment to public service principles.<\/p> <p> I hope I have shown that RTE did, and does, take its responsibilities as a public broadcaster very seriously.  It is essential that we do not just explore what happened but pay great attention to the why, and what is needed structurally and behaviourally to avoid the possibility of another crash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Mulhall","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427328000,"counter":1470,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman, for your welcome.  I do not intend to read the statement I have submitted in full, as it is on the record, but I will take a short amount of time to summarise the main points and, perhaps, give the committee additional information as regards the procedures which are in place in RTE which might be helpful for the members in directing their questions later.<\/p>  <p>  RTE is a public service media provider in receipt of public funds.  It is aware that it is owned by the audience, the people of Ireland.  This imposes additional pressures, and rightly so, to protect the audience and its interests.  If a commercial company's prime responsibility is to its shareholders, a public service media organisation's primary responsibility is to its audience.  On the other hand, RTE is charged by law to maximise its commercial revenue.  This is done to supplement the licence fee it receives.  This mixed funding model is intended to lessen the burden on Irish households and the State and allow the organisation to fulfil its public service obligations.  This dual funded model is not unique to Ireland.  The model has been in general use across Europe to fund public service broadcasters for 60 years.<\/p>  <p>  RTE is not a commercial company.  It does not make profits, nor does it have a responsibility to shareholders to deliver dividends.  Instead, any income over and above operating costs is reinvested in additional programmes, output and facilities to serve the interests of its audiences.  To document the priorities in this regard RTE produces a public service statement.  This statement is obviously available on its website but is also widely publicised and advertised.  Indeed, we are advertising at present for input to a review of that public service statement from organisations and individuals.  The statement sets out the principles that the organisation must observe to undertake its activities.  The first of the principles is of particular interest to this inquiry.  It states that RTE will remain independent of any vested interest.  I will return to this later in my remarks.<\/p>  <p>  I will move on to speak about the commercial revenues and activities, and my experience of these over the 25 years I have been involved and particularly in the period that is of interest to the inquiry.  The major commercial revenue in the years leading up to the banking crisis was advertising revenue, driven mainly by television advertising and, to a lesser extent, sponsorship.  <\/p>  <p>         Despite the restrictions placed on RTE&rsquo;s ability to generate advertising revenue as against that available to commercial broadcasters, RTE&rsquo;s advertising revenue grew significantly by 55% during the period under review, with television advertising revenue growing by 60% over the period.<\/p> <p> Throughout that period, revenue from the property and financial sectors grew, yet the proportion and relative importance did not.  Property advertising at its highest point reached 0.9% of advertising revenue; at its lowest point it was 0.3%.  The total financial sector, including insurance, building societies, credit cards, banks, credit unions and so on, accounted at the highest point for 4.6% of RTE's revenue, but generally worked out at an average of just over 3% of its total revenue.<\/p> <p> My background is in economics and I have worked for many years in RTE generating revenue.  In more recent years my responsibilities have also encompassed the growing area of regulatory affairs.  In this regard I have been involved in European directives, broadcast legislation, submissions to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the development of commercial codes.  I am currently a board member of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, which develops codes for all media in the Irish market, and I chair the on-demand audiovisual service, which develops codes for on-demand providers.  I mention these activities so that the committee understands that at the core of the guiding principles behind these directives, legislation and codes is the protection of the consumer of commercial messages.  My involvement on behalf of RTE in these bodies is to ensure that the principles sacrosanct to a public service organisation are as far as possible mirrored in the wider media environment.<\/p> <p> Before concluding my opening remarks, I will return to my first point about RTE&rsquo;s public service statement about remaining independent of vested interests.  The statement goes on to clarify this in more detail, stating that it will follow these principles by \"Ensuring the integrity of its services and that editorial decision-making is not subject to undue influence from any commercial, political, religious, social or cultural interest.\"  In furtherance of this principle within the commercial area, RTE has in place clearance committees.  All commercial activity, whether sponsorship or advertising, is cleared through those clearance committees before it is allowed to go to broadcast.  These clearance committees make sure that the provisions of the codes are applied fully, including those which are relevant to this committee, to do with the transparency of commercial content and its separation from editorial content.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032600002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427328000,"counter":1472,"content":"<p>I just want to deal with one item before we go to the lead questioners, and that is the issue of the \"Future Shock: Property Crash\" programme that was broadcast in April 2007.

The main difficulty that RTE journalists had at that time was getting people to answer direct questions right through that period.

In fact, at the same time as the BBC was breaking the story that the bailout was happening, RTE's business correspondent was on RTE programming talking about the same issue.

I will walk back into the timeframe I was asked to deal with, because it gives an answer to the Deputy's question.<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned in my statement the reaction to the \"Liveline\" programme just before the first guarantee, the &euro;100,000 guarantee on deposits, which was in September.  It is on the record in Deputy Murphy's brother's play, and I think it is in David Murphy's programme as well, that the Minister for Finance contacted the director general arising out of concerns about that \"Liveline\" programme and a worry about a run on the banks and that sort of pressure.  The Minister also contacted me directly, which was unusual.  Normally, my contact with politicians would be informal or through the press representatives.  It was a very proper and in no way inappropriate contact.  The contact was to do with concerns that a Northern Rock-type panic might ensue in the aftermath of that programme.  I had a very formal conversation with him in which I said that we had reported on the six o'clock news that there were concerns about money leaving institutions on that day.  We were accurate in our reporting because we had checked it.  In fact, two correspondents were working on the story at the time.  I said that it was not my role or RTE's role to assure the public that the banks were okay; that was the role of the Central Bank, the regulator or the Minister.  I said that if one of those people wanted to come on air to make those assurances, if they were to make it in time for the nine o'clock news we would make sure that would happen.  What happened was that the Financial Regulator came out to RTE and did an interview with George Lee, and that was broadcast on that evening's nine o'clock news.

The idea was whether it would be possible for the Financial Regulator to sponsor this, if it wished to so do.  Discussions were held with the Financial Regulator and eventually it never happened.

My officials had meetings with representatives of unions on this issue and we have taken legal advice.  The specific issue in regard to the Corbally case concerns public hearings and what matters should be brought to a public hearing.<\/p><p>I indicated on Second Stage that I intended to bring forward an amendment on having hearings in public being the default position.  That amendment is not being submitted today on Committee Stage but my intention is to bring it forward at a later stage in the Seanad.  The Bill will then return to the D&aacute;il.  That is the substantive issue that is of concern with regard to the court case.  It is not the subject of an amendment today.<\/p><p> There are matters with respect to which I am considering amendments but which are not included today.  With the Chairman's permission and with respect to the committee, I will briefly mention what these are.  The amendments are largely technical changes or amendments designed to bring further coherence to the overall approaches to registration, fitness to teach and vetting throughout the Bill.  I intend that these will be progressed on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  However, the committee will recall that prior to and during the Second Stage debate, I also indicated my intention to provide for the conduct of disciplinary hearings in public, and that I would bring forward these amendments at a later stage.  It has not been possible to finalise the draft provisions in time for the committee's consideration of the Bill today.  I remain committed to the inclusion of this provision and I intend to bring forward amendments in the Seanad to give effect to this policy.  We have to allow sufficient time to seek and consider legal advice and the views expressed by stakeholders, including the stakeholders referred to by the Deputy, as well as the views outlined in the House on Second Stage.  My officials have briefed the teaching unions and the Teaching Council in this respect.<\/p><p> Having taken cognisance of the relevant issues and in light of the legal advice, the approach I plan to take is as follows.  Mirroring recent legislation for other professional regulators, specifically the nursing and midwifery board and the Medical Council, I intend to provide that fitness to teach hearings will be held in public as a default position but that on the request of a witness and where the witness can show reasonable and sufficient cause to the disciplinary committee of the Teaching Council, some or all of the hearings may be held in private.  This approach can cater for long-standing principles of natural justice, such as those espoused in the European Convention on Human Rights.  I also plan to include express provision that the registrant who is the subject of the hearing is entitled to be represented at the hearing and will be furnished in advance with information about evidence in support of the complaint.<\/p><p> As well as the conduct of hearings in public, I will also provide for the publication by the council of the outcome of disciplinary hearings where it is in the public interest to do so and the notification of findings against a teacher to regulators outside the State where appropriate.  Again, this is in keeping with the arrangements applying to other professional regulators, and the legal provisions will be similar to those which already exist.  I am advised and am satisfied that this approach can cater for the types of issues that have been raised in respect of individuals' rights, such as the safeguarding of minors or vulnerable adults, the protection of private lives and privacy concerning medical fitness.  The disciplinary committee will have sufficient discretion to determine when privacy should be employed, including anonymising where it is considered appropriate.  We have a series of steps before any case would come to a public hearing.<\/p><p> The disciplinary committee is largely the body that will make those judgments as to what is severe enough to go to public hearing.  It is also important to be aware that no case will proceed to a hearing without having gone through several screening stages that are designed to weed out less serious complaints that would not merit a full disciplinary inquiry.  Following completion of Committee Stage, my Department will also be proofing the Bill, as amended, and if any technical corrections are required, the necessary amendments will be introduced on Report Stage.  I hope this provides some clarity on the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#B00300","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1858,"content":"<p>I am a little confused by the Minister's comments.

I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by teachers, particularly in Ireland, which is such a small place.  That is one of the points that has been made.  Having a default position where complaints are heard in a public hearing, when the potential for very damaging complaints that may not really have substance, could tarnish the reputation of a teacher or vulnerable children who are put in the limelight when they really should not be.  That is quite problematic and for the protection of both teachers and children, if there is acknowledgement of the need to screen complaints, why should there be a default position of a public hearing?  On a case-by-case basis, as unions and the Teaching Council have indicated, there may be good reason for something to go public.  That should surely be considered on a case-by-case basis if we are going to be sensitive to all the concerns about people's reputations and potential damage.

They are working for weeks and they do not know that they have not been paid and that they are not registered.  They discover many weeks afterwards that they have not got paid because they were not registered or they had been removed from the register for some reason.

Deputy Conaghan is right on that point.  I appreciate Deputy Boyd Barrett's concern but there is already provision in regard to informing people that they are not on the register.  I will explain it in more detail.<\/p> <p>  Section 30 of the 2001 Act provides that a person who is employed as a teacher in a recognised school shall not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be paid from Oireachtas funds where he or she is not a registered teacher or where he or she stands removed or suspended from the register.  A substantial communication campaign took place in preparation for the commencement of section 30 of the Act, which was commenced last year, so that all teachers would be well aware of the requirement to be registered and the implications of non-registration.<\/p> <p>  While it appears that the intention behind the amendment is to ensure that a teacher's salary would not be discontinued without that teacher being informed, there are appropriate provisions elsewhere within the Bill that address this issue.  Requirements in regard to the council notifying teachers of decisions made in respect of initial registration, renewal of registration and in regard to fitness to teach inquiries are already in place.  Under the amended Act teachers will therefore be notified of decisions regarding their registration status, including any decision to remove or suspend registration which impacts on payment of salary.  However, as the Teaching Council is not directly involved with teachers' employment or payment, the council would not be in a position to notify teachers of changes to payment in accordance with the amended proposal.  For those reasons I do not consider that the amendment is appropriate in section 30.  <\/p> <p>  There is already provision that teachers will be notified if they are not on the register or if they are removed from the register.  The implication of that is that they will not be paid.  There was an information campaign when that section was brought into place.  We cannot force the Teaching Council to tell people they will not be paid because the Teaching Council does not pay them.  They are paid from a different source but if there is a need to in some way further communicate, I would be very happy to take up the intention of the amendment.

As Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, this has happened on a number of occasions.  The teachers have been teaching for a few weeks and it is only when the pay cheque does not come through on pay day that they realise their registration is not up to date and that they are not liable to be paid for the period they have already worked in the school.  How can there be a situation that a teacher whose registration is not valid, because he or she has not paid, can commence work and be working, yet the school has not checked that or the teacher, for whatever reason, would not be aware of the fact that his or her registration is not up to date?  Surely there could be some means, in legislation or otherwise, whereby a better checking mechanism is put in place to ensure the school verifies that the teacher's registration is up to date and that it will be in a position to pay them.  What is happening is a sign that the schools are not checking that a teacher's registration is valid and up to date, and I would have thought that would have been a requirement when somebody starts a job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#E00500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1897,"content":"<p>Perhaps we should remind schools of their duty not to employ anybody who is not a registered teacher.

The concern raised in the amendment is that the term &quot;fit and proper&quot; is too subjective and is open to abuse or a subjective interpretation which is too wide.  Obviously, one wants people to be fit and proper in the sense one would generally understand that, but that phraseology is too subjective.  It is the type of phrase that could allow the parish priest to say somebody is not fit and proper, for example.  The proposal is that we be a little more specific about what we mean by fit and proper and remove that subjective phraseology.  What we want them to be, I presume, is qualified and vetted according to the legislation.  The vetting ensures that they are fit and proper.  If the Minister wishes to state there are other criteria that should be deployed in deciding what is fit and proper, that is fair enough but the obvious ones are that they would be properly qualified to do the job and that they would be vetted according to the legislation.

The Bill's provisions relating to the council being satisfied that an applicant for registration is a fit and proper person to be registered enable the council to consider, before registering a person, whether that person is a suitable person to be registered, including whether that person is a suitable person from a child protection perspective.  A key aim of this Bill is to make Garda vetting an integral part of initial teacher registration and to ensure that any person who is not a suitable person to be registered, including where a person poses a risk to children or vulnerable persons, shall not be registered as a teacher in the first instance.  The effect of amendments Nos. 4 and 6 would be to remove the capacity of the council to assess a Garda vetting disclosure for this purpose.  If amendments Nos. 4 and 6 were accepted, the council would be able to assess a Garda vetting disclosure only for the purposes of determining if a person was qualified to be admitted to the register.  This is clearly not the intended purpose of a vetting disclosure.  The proposed amendments run contrary to the intention of the relevant provisions amending section 31 and the overall child protection aims of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Regarding whether a person is qualified to be registered, the Bill already makes separate provision relating to the council setting out requirements in respect of the qualifications that a person must have attained in order to be registered.  I therefore do not accept amendments Nos. 4 and 6.<\/p> <p>  My amendment No. 5 is necessary to correct references inadvertently used in this provision of the published Bill to a registered teacher applying for a renewal of registration under this section.  As section 7 amends section 31 of the principal Act and is concerned with applications for initial registration, this amendment now correctly refers to a person applying for registration under this section.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 7, the effect of which is to re-state in the provision in question a requirement for vetting that is already in place in the Bill.  Section 7 already amends section 31 of the principal Act to provide that the Teaching Council shall not register a person unless the council has received and considered a vetting disclosure in respect of that person.  Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to make this amendment.<\/p> <p>  The council, as a body, will develop its own procedures and guidelines setting out the manner in which an assessment will be carried out.

It also puts in place requirements in relation to the council notifying the teacher concerns where the council intends to seek a vetting disclosure for that purpose.  It is important to note that under the Bill not all registered teachers will be vetted each year.  Rather, section 11 of the Bill allows the council to plan and undertake such vetting in a structured and phased manner and sets out what the council will have regard to when considering whether to seek a vetting disclosure in respect of a teacher for renewal of his or her registration.  In that regard, this section will enable the council to prioritise the vetting of those teachers who were never vetted under the non-statutory arrangements, to subsequently address those who have been vetted under the existing non-statutory arrangements but who have not been vetted under the new statutory vetting arrangements and to provide thereafter for periodic revetting of all registered teachers to be undertaken on an ongoing basis.

This amendment ensures that those teachers who are being vetted for renewal of registration purposes receive adequate and timely notification in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#F02900","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427364000,"counter":1938,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1939,"content":"<p>I move amendment No.  10:<\/p><blockquote>In page 10, line 23, to delete &ldquo;the teacher&rdquo;

Accordingly, this amendment makes provisions where such an appeal has been made for the investigating committee to review the decision of the director not to refer the complaint to the investigating committee and to either uphold that decision or to quash the decision and then proceed to hold an inquiry in respect of that complaint. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#H01800","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427364000,"counter":1998,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":1999,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#H02000","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":2000,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<\/p><blockquote>In page 17, to delete lines 7 to 13 and substitute the following:&quot;(i) by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (a):<blockquote>&quot;(a) Subject to paragraph (b), the Investigating Committee shall hold an inquiry into the fitness to teach of a registered teacher in respect of each complaint&mdash;<blockquote>(i) referred to it by the Director under subsection (3)(a), or<br \/><br \/>(ii) to which subsection (4A)(b) applies.&quot;,<\/blockquote>and<\/blockquote>(ii) in paragraph (b)&mdash;<blockquote>(I) by the substitution of &quot;a complaint&quot; for &quot;an application or appeal&quot;, and<br \/><br \/>(II) by the substitution of &quot;the complaint&quot; for &quot;the application or appeal&quot; in each place it occurs,&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are technical amendments consequent to amendment No. 24.

It provides that the panel may consider the disclosure in the same manner as the investigating committee may consider it.

However, that office is restricted in handling complaints made to it to the process by which the complaint was dealt with as opposed to the content of a complaint.  That is something which needs to be addressed.  It is a role in which the Department, as the overseeing body for education and the setting of education policy, needs to become involved.  In addition, the Department is the primary funding body for education.  We need the Department to provide avenues for appeals to be made to it where a family or a young person aged over 18 feel they have been treated disproportionately or unfairly or a decision has been made by a board of management which is not in their best interests and where there is no provision for an appeal in that regard to another body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12015032600002#J03200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1427364000,"counter":2045,"content":"<p>The issue relating to sections 28 and 29 must be addressed but it is not appropriate to this legislation.

I am not satisfied that the current provisions of section 28, which was of its time, and I plan to revise it in order to provide in law for a charter.  There is a commitment to introduce a charter for parents and learners.

Therefore, discussion on the matter proposed by the Deputy is premature at this time.

I will start by giving an overview of Soilse, the addiction rehabilitation service, from which the report came.  I will then go through the main issues related to the report in a question and answer format.<\/p> <p>  Soilse is the HSE's daytime drug rehabilitation project in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  It was established in 1992 and works with people who are either preparing to detox or who have completed a residential drug treatment programme and are in the early stages of recovery.  Our service users are former heroin addicts.<\/p> <p>  What is the status of drug use in Ireland today?  In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s the drug abuse problem was mainly opiate, primarily heroin, addiction.  Today people are using not just heroin but also benzodiazepines, alcohol and other drugs.  This is known as poly-drug abuse.  Since the 1970s the response has been to treat opiate addiction by substituting methadone for heroin.  Known as the public health model, it seeks to reduce harm to society by reducing the need to commit crime to get heroin and eliminating the use of heroin and the sharing of needles.  Prescribing methadone and needles exchange reduce the health risks associated with heroin addiction.  About 10,000 people are in methadone treatment, one third for more than a decade.  Their struggles are captured in the case studies in Addiction Recovery: A Contagious Paradigm and the characteristics of the four case studies are very telling.  All have family dysfunction, were early users of drugs and early school leavers, grew up in chaos, have been on methadone and benzodiazepines programmes, have been associated with prison or charges, have suffered homelessness, health problems, suicides and death within their immediate circumstances.<\/p> <p>  What can recovery offer?  In Ireland and internationally there is an emerging focus on recovery from addiction.  This view of recovery sees services being re-framed around service users.  Unlike the public health model, a recovery model puts service users at the centre of treatment and rehabilitation responses and looks to enhance their quality of life by involving them fully in their own care.  This means reorienting treatment and rehabilitation services towards a recovery paradigm, recognising that service users' voices are important and enabling them to direct their own goals and thus change and re-frame their lives.  Essentially, it is a service user, service-led response.<\/p> <p>  What evidence supports this approach?  The concept of recovery was first introduced in the addiction research literature in 1999 with the work of Granfield and Cloud. They showed how 46 individuals had been able to overcome their addiction independently of services primarily because they had had what Granfield and Cloud called \"recovery capital\"; in other words, pre-existing jobs, qualifications, income, family support, social networks and a home.  Subsequently, Cloud and Granfield published their theory of recovery.  It comprises four elements: social capital &ndash; relationships, supports and groups to which we belong; physical capital &ndash; property and income; human capital &ndash; education and skills, positive health and aspirations; and cultural capital &ndash; values, beliefs and attitudes.  Focusing on these assets helps a person to build recovery capital.  This approach has been taken in England, Wales, Scotland and further afield as the main organising construct for addiction services.  The approach in Scotland is that recovery should be the explicit aim of all services providing treatment and rehabilitation for those with problem drug use and the service delivery principle is that recovery should be the focus of care.  Assessment and recovery plans should address the totality of people's lives.<\/p> <p>  Does Ireland want to move towards a recovery framework?  Addiction Recovery: A Contagious Paradigm sets out the case in Ireland for a move towards a recovery framework to deliver addiction services.  Over a decade ago the mid-term review of the drug strategy in 2005 showed that stakeholders felt service users should not be kept on methadone indefinitely but assisted in \"moving on\"&rsquo; towards recovery and social integration.  The report of the working group on rehabilitation that emerged from the mid-term review elaborated on this and signposted the key elements of social integration: housing, work and education.  These are the key indicators from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Abuse.  It stated the overall aim of services should be \"to maximise the quality of life, re-engagement, independent living and employability of the recovering problem drug user in line with their aspirations\".<\/p> <p>  In 2011 Martin Keane conducted research in Soilse and showed how an adult learning approach that fused education and recovery could help service users to develop recovery capital, progress in education into college and successfully move away from the drug culture.  The HSE Dublin north addiction service review in 2013 recommended this recovery focused approach and the addiction services in north Dublin are putting structures in place to enable recovery.  In the review recovery was defined as \"a person-centred journey enabling people to get a sense of control over their own problems, the services they receive and their lives and providing opportunities to participate in wider society\".<\/p> <p>  The national drug rehabilitation implementation committee's evaluation in 2013 which was authored by Professor Barry also reviewed the mechanisms which would underpin a recovery approach and found broad support for them.  Therefore, at both a practice and policy level, momentum has been building in the past decade towards a recovery response in Ireland.  The HSE's 2015 primary care division operation plan states each service user should have a key worker and care plan, that service users should be transferred from HSE clinics to GP surgeries and that regular client satisfaction surveys should be carried out.  Again, it puts the service user at the centre of the process.<\/p> <p>  Addiction Recovery: A Contagious Paradigm describes in detail the principles of recovery which give shape to the emerging framework and also supports each of the principles with a substantial amount of research and literature.  The principles are the key drivers of many of the responses in the countries I have listed.  There are 12 principles, the first of which is that there are many pathways to recovery.  Again, we speak in the document about natural recovery, about which Sheedy and Whitter spoke.  Granfield and Cloud talk about recovery capital.  Our own work in Soilse is about a continuum of care.  There are other forms of recovery, for example, fellowship recovery and Christian enlightenment recovery.<\/p> <p>  The second principle is that recovery is self-directed and empowering.  The paradigm shift means that the service user is the agent of his or her own change and fully involved with the goals and targets being addressed.  When I thought about coming here today, I remembered how during my early days working in this area a man had broken down in a group and began to cry.  I asked him why he was crying and he said it was the first time in 15 years that he had been asked his opinion.  Very often people are treadmilled through processes and not actually engaged at their centre.<\/p> <p>  The third principle is that recovery involves a personal recognition of the need for change and transformation.  One of the big goals people will have is to move from being in services or treatment to abstinence.  Again, McKeganey said 56% of service users in Scotland saw this as the type of transformation they wanted.  The third principle is that recovery is holistic.  It is not one-dimensional treatment but concerns broader quality of life issues.  Again, a process of life change involves the physical, social, emotional, spiritual and mental health needs of the individual.  That is what the process of recovery should work towards.<\/p> <p>  The fourth principle is that recovery has cultural dimensions.  There will be drug problems in other groupings such as Travellers, the LGBT community and new communities and cultural dimensions that need to be addressed.  Our own people face challenges when they leave the safety and security of our services.  In his research Keane looked at how these cultural dimensions changed the person.<\/p> <p>  The fifth principle is that recovery occurs in a continuum of improved health and well-being.  De Maeyer talks about quality of life and states improved health and well-being means new relationships, being independent, having work and feeling good - having a meaningful life.  These are basic, simple things, but to a recovering drug user, they are imperative.<\/p> <p>  The sixth principle is that recovery emerges from hope and gratitude.  People in recovery become models of success.  In communities where there is little positive at which to look in terms of the drugs problem people who become drug free, get their lives back together, find work, get back with their families and give back in terms of voluntary activity are seen as models of success and inspire others.<\/p> <p>  The seventh principle is that recovery involves a process of healing and self-redefinition.  Owing to the needs I mentioned and the characteristics of addiction, multiple recoveries are needed and lead to complete identity transformation.<\/p> <p>  The eighth principle is that recovery involves addressing discrimination and transcending shame and stigma.  Drug use discredits identity.  Therefore, there must a complete shift in social functioning which is facilitated by the pursuit of mainstream activities.<\/p> <p>  The ninth principle is that recovery is supported by peers and allies.<\/p><p>When people get into recovery, they rekindle old relationships and form new ones, find a sponsor and receive family and community support.  Again, there is a massive social support network available.  People who interact with the services and work towards recovery will seek strength from others in the services and the groups with which they are involved.  Recovery involves rejoining and rebuilding life in the community.  On page 35 of the report Buchanan, in relation to the wall of exclusion, is quoted.  The vast majority of service responses work below what is termed the line of control into the area of chaos.  This is where treatment is focused in the main.  <\/p><p> There is a disparity in terms of the resources devoted and attention paid to support and recovery.  One of the contentions is that the paradigm should shift to prioritise recovery.  Recovery is a reality.  The document was launched in the Mansion House in July, at which time I recall Mannix Flynn saying there was such a thing as \"recovered\".  It is so simple a word, but it is so real and telling.  Through my work over many years I have met hundreds of people who have recovered.  However, given the phenomenal level of stigma attached to drug addiction, they are unwilling to appear before the committee or on camera.  When we asked a few people how they felt about appearing before the committee, they said they could not do so because of their families, children and so on.  In terms of recovery being a reality, Sheedy and Whitter reckon about 58% of people can achieve recovery.  I know from research undertaken by Soilse that the outcomes for those who recover and regain a holistic quality of life when drug free are significant.  These principles were put together after 20 years of research and widespread consultation.  They are well grounded and scientific.    <\/p><p> I will now move to how recovery services operate in other countries.  The United Kingdom, including Wales and Scotland, the United States and Australia have recovery academies which are groups of people, including researchers, service users, families and community support workers, who come together to research and advocate on behalf of those in recovery.  Recovery champions are people who are positive role models in the community who are in recovery, icons for the possibility of recovery and drivers of change.  Recovery coaches are people who give advice and support on addiction and life issues.  This is a major plank of the support provided for people in other countries getting into recovery.  Fellowships such as Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous are operational countrywide.  In other countries events such as International Recovery Month are celebrated.  In September last year a parade was held in Manchester to celebrate recovery.  This shows that other jurisdictions have a better infrastructure in place and that the paradigm has moved more considerably towards this.  Recovery infrastructure such as caf&eacute;s and houses is common in many of the main towns in the United Kingdom where more than &pound;1 million has been provided for the development of a new facility in Birmingham called \"Recovery Central\".  This facility is due to open this year and will include a one-stop-shop for recovery information and services, including work experience, volunteering, employment opportunities, community-based social enterprises, furniture restoration, bike repairs, car maintenance, property maintenance, an art and design studio, a recording studio and a drama studio.  It is a creative holistic response.  As I said, the facility will be called \"Recovery Central\", an icon that will send the message from a high street location that recovery is important and possible.   <\/p><p> I will focus on how all of the aforementioned relates to Ireland.  Soilse is an example of services implementing a recovery response.  We believe people have fantastic potential and will get their lives back together and achieve things that they would never have dreamed of because their expectations had been reduced by the fact that they had been in treatment for so long.  Soilse is part of the HSE addiction services' continuum of care.  We provide clinical pathways, which means that the service can stabilise people and prepare them for detoxification in an in-house residential detoxification unit, Cuan Dara.  Drug free residential treatment follows in Keltoi.  This is followed by a drug free day time programme in the Soilse facility in the north inner city.  We are in partnership with the VEC and thus have a balance of therapeutic and educational inputs.  The service has been vocationally designed and developed.  We are very clear on the outcomes we want to achieve.  We want people to abstain from drugs and alcohol; to have support structures around them in terms of counselling, after care, meetings and sponsors and to become involved in day time or education programmes.  That is a recovery package.<\/p><p> Soilse is also involved in an innovative European Union lifelong learning project called RECOVEU.  It involves five countries - Ireland, England, Cyprus, Romania and Italy.  Following a review of policy and practice in these countries it became evident that there was a dearth of channels and opportunities for people from an addiction background who wished to move to the mainstream, be it in the area of work or education.  A leaflet setting out where we are at in that regard has been circulated.  We are about half way through the project and the real work begins in the next couple of months.  What we are trying to do is design facilitation packs and learning modules that will facilitate people in their journey to recovery and into college.  <\/p><p> Soilse uses recovery coaches who are trained by the Finglas addiction support team and Dublin City University.  We have eight recovery coaches who help people with resourcing, advocacy and lifestyle issues.  Soilse also supports International Recovery Month and in this regard, held a number of activities in Dublin last September which, unfortunately, were not widely covered by the media.  We held three large events, including a conference in the Ashling Hotel, a health and fitness event in the Phoenix Park which was attended by more than 200 people and various social activities.  A lot happened during recovery month.  We need to focus on making people aware that there is a recovery community and movement and getting them to buy into it.  <\/p><p> Soilse has been consistently involved in research, including, as I mentioned, the Keane research and has also contributed to research by the Northern Area Addiction Service.  The document made available to members is the result of two years' work.  <\/p><p> Many service users and service providers see recovery as a viable option.  I engage consistently with service users, many of whom have fantastic ideas.  In terms of the outcomes in the four case studies, one of those involved has travelled the world, while another spent 15 Christmases in prison at great cost to the State.  He is now in recovery and cannot believe that when his neighbours go on holidays, they leave the keys to their houses with him.  There are many good anecdotes that support this transformation.  Recovery offers hope and a vision for those caught in services long term.  The model will challenge fatalism and stigma.  As I said, stigma is a huge issue.  Recovery also contributes to building inclusive communities and options for those who want to change.<\/p><p> The document before the committee was triggered by a symposium which brought together more than 100 people in recovery to talk not about war stories or the desperation and depression associated with drugs but about their futures and what they would like to see happen.  The solutions and ideas proposed are embodied in our recommendations.  They include the use of recovery champions, coaching, existing community assets and a reconfiguration of some services to ensure they will be more holistic and outcome focused.  The emphasis is on solutions.  The desired outcome of today's meeting and as a result of the document is that recovery will become a central plank of the drugs strategy review which is due for completion next year.  As I said, the report reflects stakeholders' views and their principles, case studies, workshops and literature on recovery.<\/p><p> I will be happy to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry McAleenan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2090,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McAleenan for his very interesting presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2091,"content":"<p>My presentation will be shorter.  It was important for the joint committee to hear about the reality of addiction from Mr. McAleenan.  It sounds simple, but it is hard work that requires dedication across the board.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak to it on this topic.  I have been involved in the drugs service since the early 1990s.  Mr. McAleenan and I are now almost dinosaurs in the service.<\/p><p>In the summer of 2012 I attended the 20th anniversary celebration of Soilse, the symposium that Mr. Gerry McAleenan mentioned.  It was a moving and very powerful experience, involving a mix of service users, service providers and community activists as well as those with an interest in the country&rsquo;s response to our heroin epidemic mostly, although this goes beyond heroin.  It was very well attended and inspiring.<\/p><p> Shortly afterwards I was asked by Mr. McAleenan whether I would be interested in contributing to a document with the aim of promoting recovery among drug users in Ireland.  I was very happy to do so and we were joined by Mr. Martin Keane from the Health Research Board, who has prepared much of the literature on this, including much of the international literature Mr. McAleenan quoted.  Over the course of the following year we worked on the document and spoke to four of the people who had presented their stories at the symposium.  We asked if they would be happy to have their stories published in the report.  Personal stories make more of an impact than statistics.  Mr. McAleenan has alluded to the stigma.  People were very brave in standing up in public and talking about their problems and allowing those problems to be in the document before the committee today.<\/p><p> The document was launched in the Mansion House and we had a couple of meetings with the then Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Deputy Alex White.  We have since been in contact with Department of Health officials and are hoping to arrange a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, subsequent to our attendance here today.<\/p><p> Mr. McAleenan has given the details of the many benefits and we can come back to them during the discussion.  However, it will not happen by just wishing it to happen.  We prepared the document to try to turn what everybody believes is a good idea into practice.  It is a reorientation, obviously.  The public health model is still part of the strategy within the HSE, but there is much more scope for recovery if people are given the supports Mr. McAleenan mentioned.  There are 10,000 people on methadone and more people can recover if they are given the supports.  They are very basic supports; they are not high-flying or technology based.  Our document outlines a series of recommendations which we can come back to.  We are very keen that members of the committee are aware of the challenges and how we can make recovery a reality.<\/p><p> The document is essentially based on hope.  Many people claim that people addicted to opiates have no hope, but that is not true.  Of course, opiate addiction causes many problems and kills a number of people in Ireland.  About one person dies from an overdose of drugs in Ireland every day.  People die, but people can also recover.  People want to take control of their lives and many drug users are parents who want to do the best for their children.  The recovery model would give them the skills and capacity for parenthood as well as everything else.  For any of us who are parents, parenthood is probably the most important activity of our lives.<\/p><p> People will respond positively if offered supports.  These supports include access to second-chance education, or maybe even first-chance education for people who have not had it, and literacy training.  Obviously the economic recession has not helped drug users and with us, one hopes, coming out of that, there is potential for employment and self-esteem to be restored.<\/p><p> Many drug users are also caught up in the current homelessness crisis.  We talk about people who have been squeezed by the recession.  Most of the people who are addicted to opiates were squeezed well before 2007.  They have had a lifetime of being squeezed and there is a lot to be made up.  The community of Dublin's north inner city has been disproportionately affected, but there is enthusiasm.<\/p><p> As Mr. McAleenan mentioned, I was involved in an evaluation of the HSE's recovery model document, The National Drug Rehabilitation Framework.  Many of the staff in the drugs services are enthusiastic and are keen to be part of this recovery, but it needs structure and support.  This does not apply just to north inner city Dublin.  Addiction affects every community in the country, particularly when alcohol is factored in.  The principles of recovery apply to alcohol as well as to other substances.  There is not as big a difference between alcohol and other drugs as people think.  There is polydrug use and benzodiazepines.  There has been an explosion in the prescribing of benzodiazepines in this country and it is an increasing cause of death.  It is a huge problem and is costing the State a fortune.  There are ways of finding money to support things like recovery.<\/p><p> We point out in the document that much of what we are recommending has been the policy of the Department of Health and the national drugs strategy for about ten years.  Some excellent documents promoting a way of doing things have been published.  We have a bit of a difficulty in Ireland; we are better at writing documents than implementing them.  This is about the reality of implementation.  The devil is always in the detail.  We have the detail here and Mr. McAleenan has given a flavour of it.  We hope the members of the committee will take some time to read it in more detail because obviously today is, we hope, the start of a process to push for this to be done in a better way in the future.<\/p><p> The current national drugs strategy is due to end in 2016 and we are aware that discussions are taking place with regard to its successor.  We want these principles to become mainstreamed in a more effective way in the new drugs strategy.  That is our timescale.  We are only three people and Mr. Tom O'Brien from the HSE is very supportive.  Obviously Ms Sonia Dillon and all the staff in Soilse work on this every day.  They have enormous expertise.  We need to disseminate that in other parts of the country.  Mr. McAleenan can outline the success stories.  There is capacity for more success if we re-orientate.  It would be a terrible mistake not to grant recovery a much higher profile in the new strategy.<\/p><p> We urge the committee to support recovery across all Departments.  It is not just a health issue.  It also affects education and I mentioned homelessness, so it is a housing issue.  There is a big problem with a shortage of accommodation.  Drug users in recovery are having to be placed in wet hostels and hostels where people are taking drugs.  Obviously the public consciousness about housing problems is about people stuck in mortgage arrears, etc.  However, there is a continuing housing and accommodation issue among the drug-using community.<\/p><p> What we are suggesting is completely in line with the Government strategy, Healthy Ireland.  It is about a multi-sectoral approach because the issue of drugs is not just a medical issue but it is also a social issue.  There are issues in Cork and there is also a drugs task force in Cork.  There are problems throughout the country.  The heroin issue is still concentrated in Dublin with approximately 9,000 of the 10,000 people on methadone in the Dublin area.  However, when benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, pills and alcohol are added in, this is a national issue.<\/p><p> I thank the members of the committee for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2093,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  We have had this debate on an ongoing basis.  Professor Barry noted that we are very good at writing reports but that the implementation sometimes lacks commitment.  I wonder about our treatment programmes for opiate addiction.  I have often got the impression that while there is great goodwill in terms of the effort of the HSE and others at the coalface, deep down as a society we are saying to keep giving them the methadone and as long as they leave us alone on the street, we will keep moving on as a society.  I do not believe we have confronted the real challenges that individuals face in their chaotic lives as drug addicts.  The collective view of society seems to be that if they are not hassling us on the boardwalk or wherever, we are happy enough once we think they are getting their methadone.<\/p> <p>  Given that there are individual cases and individuals lives, we need to accept that we need individual pathways for recovery.  We have to assess more deeply the individuals' problems rather than just having them queue up for a cup of sugary methadone every morning and letting them off.  I know it will take huge resources.  I know that methadone is cheap, but it does not really succeed in getting users to move from heroin abuse to involvement with the health services and into a recovery treatment programme.  That pathway is fairly poor to say the very least.<\/p><p>It is poor for many reasons.  Clearly, one of the main reasons is that it is not resourced.  As a result, people fall back on methadone, fall out of the treatment programmes and go back on heroin.<br\/><br\/>I have no in-depth knowledge of the matter.  I come from Cork.  We do not have a major heroin problem in Cork, but I can sense little clusters of the problem developing in certain parts of the city.  We know what happens if people in a community turn a blind eye to heroin.  This was evident in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Dublin, where it quickly becomes an epidemic and caused major social problems.<br\/><br\/>I am highlighting all the problems while I look blankly when someone asks me for solutions.  Many people have referenced the Lisbon approach.  If we legalised or decriminalised drugs would we have more engagement?  That may involve looking at it from a social and health point of view.  The idea is that we would not have heroin addicts walking around, ducking the law and trying to avoid any form of contact with the State because of the threat of criminal convictions and everything that flows from that.  If they engage and come out of a system with criminal convictions, that does not look great on anyone's curriculum vitae.<br\/><br\/>Have the witnesses examined other trials?  Let us be honest.  I presume that, collectively, society is experimenting all the time with how to deal with these issues.  I have read a number of reports on Lisbon and how the city is dealing with the problem as well as other areas that have tried this approach.  Is there any merit in examining it?  Would we be simply wasting our time by examining what they have done?  Should we instead work on the strategies in place at the moment?<br\/><br\/>Professor Barry said that with the upturn in the economy, there would be more resources and potential to do more.  Previously, we had an economy that was rather upturned for a while, so to speak.  Was there any correlation between a drop in heroin use or abuse and better outcomes for heroin addicts when we had endless resources and a lot of money to spend on everything and anything?  Is it the case that we have to think smarter now about how we use our resources?  My view is that it did not seem to reduce substantially.  I recall walking the streets of Dublin at night during the Celtic tiger and seeing major heroin problems.  Perhaps we were less inclined to notice them because we were so busy booking flights to Spain and elsewhere.  I do not mean to be flippant but I believe we should examine it, because if we are turning into an economy that will have more resources in the coming years, we must not repeat the same mistakes or take the view that money will solve the problem without inherently addressing the underlying issues.  That remains a concern.<br\/><br\/>The witnesses commented on how the pathways to drug addiction are fairly defined, including dysfunctionality in the family, unemployment, poor educational outcomes, lower socio-economic backgrounds and so on.  I presume the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>is that if we could address these problems, we would have fewer people taking the path to drug addiction.  Even during the Celtic Tiger, when we experienced unemployment at 4%, which is full employment in a modern economy, we still had that problem. How can we address it?<br\/><br\/>I am asking questions rather than having any solutions in mind.  One thing is for sure, and that is a review of the drug strategy will be completed next year.  As with any strategy, we should review how successful it was and where it failed.  There is no doubt that we still have a major problem in certain areas of 10,000 people who are consistently on methadone.  I do not expect people to be critical of their employers but I am seeking an honest appraisal of whether we should look at other programmes in other parts of the world.  Are we stuck with what we have?  Is it a question of trying to make the best of it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#E00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2095,"content":"<p>I appreciate the presentation from the witnesses.  I am mindful that people are substance misusing.  The witnesses referred to the recovered.  It is a question of the transition period and the services during that transition period.  Professor Barry commented on the homeless wet hostels.  I was thinking of that because I have received representations from Dual Diagnosis Ireland about the issues of mental health and substance misuse.  Often we have different pathways for someone to get support, help and recovery, but we do not always see the interconnectedness.  Let us consider the homeless situation.  I am not trying to compound the issue but the reality is that there is interconnectedness between these issues.  How we as a society response to these issues is relevant.  Often we force people into homelessness because we do not have an appropriate mechanism to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  I am still trying to work it out in my head.  I agree with everything I hear from the witnesses.  How do we move from being good on paper to actual implementation?  What are the tangible items that, as parliamentarians, we should be calling for?  The idea is that I can leave here saying clearly what is needed.<\/p> <p>  How do we ensure the approach is replicated throughout Ireland?  While I understand that methadone is rather Dublin-based, the reality is that on the basis of the figures given by the deputation, it is not limited to one area.  Certainly, we have no wish to be moving people into an area simply because that is where they will get services and support.  How do we ensure the approach is agreed?  We have a geographical lottery and, therefore, a consistent approach is important.<\/p> <p>  The drugs strategy is due to end in 2016.  We seem to have a number of strategies that will end of 2016.  What work has been done?  How much consultation has there been with the organisations and those involved with the delivery of services?  Is there a move to consider an implementation plan rather than an additional strategy?  Perhaps we could take some of the principles from the current strategy and move the document more towards deciding which Department should take a lead.  Ideally, it should be a Government strategy rather than a departmental strategy.  That is what occurred in the children area and with the Healthy Ireland initiative.  I am trying to see where the process lies.  It is something about which I am concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#F00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2096,"content":"<p>I thank the deputation for the presentation.  I compliment a former colleague and Deputy, Mr. Pat Carey.  Any time he had to deal with this issue as a Minister of State, he always made clear the role of addiction in families.  The same applies to the previous Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Alex White.<\/p> <p>  I will set out where I am going with this.  We should have a Minister at the Cabinet table with responsibility for this area rather than a Minister of State.  He or she could make decisions on these issues.  If we are ever to go the road of recovery, we must have someone who is batting all the time at the Cabinet table on behalf of people.  I will lay my cards on the table in that sense.<\/p> <p>  The report is excellent.  I have not read it all but I have read most of it.  I come from an area that has had serious drug problems for many years.  We still have people using not only drugs but also alcohol.  It has become a serious problem in poorer communities.<\/p> <p>  I read the four stories of the recovering addicts.  It was clear from the stories that I had met them all in my life in the community centre where I worked as a youth leader.  When children came in at the age of seven years, I probably knew by looking at them that they were not going to reach the age of 18 years or, if they did, they would have multiple problems along the road.  Many families lost not just one but two or three members.  It is devastating for every community when this happens.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest problems I have found through the years is that all these services are based on one particular area with a poorer social class of people, or whatever we are called.  Although there may be five or six services within less than a kilometre, that does not lend itself easily to the rest of the community who may not believe that they have a role to play in helping people to recover.  It brings significant problems and that is still the case today.<\/p> <p>  While I could go on, I will not because the Chairman will not let me, so I will ask two questions and try to make them brief.  I am going to read the rest of the report.<\/p><p>I will certainly make it my business as a member of the Fine Gael parliamentary party to speak to the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Taoiseach on what I believe is a very serious issue that has never been addressed properly by any Government.  It is not just about the addict; it is about families and communities as well.<\/p><p> What is needed to implement Cloud and Granfield's theory of recovery in Ireland?  It is operating in Wales, Scotland and England, as was said.  Will the witnesses tell us what is needed here?  What role do they think the national drugs task force and the local drugs task forces should have in making Cloud and Granfield's theory of recovery happen?<\/p><p> I will finish with a personal opinion.  Down through the years I have always believed there are too many organisations in this area.  Many people who are trying to recover or get away from addictions seem to wander physically from one service to another.  I have tried to find out if there is a register anywhere where we can see all these people's names and who they are, whether they are men or women, their age group and where they have come from.  Is there some kind of register like this?  I always feel that when some people do not get what they want in one service, they continue on to the next service.  They seem to go in a vicious circle and some, unfortunately, do not come out of that circle.  My personal view, from working in the community, is that there is duplication of services.<\/p><p> There is only one way to deal with addiction in this country, particularly around drug abuse and alcohol abuse, and that is to have a specific Minister who will take on the challenges that face every Government and do something about them.  That is why I started off by speaking about the former Minister, Pat Carey, and the Minister, Deputy Alex White.  I want to mention Pat Carey especially because I know him a long time.  When he worked as a teacher in Finglas many moons ago, he had a theory on addiction and on working with people who came from poorer families and socially deprived backgrounds.  That never changed, even when he was elected to the D&aacute;il.  I cannot find words to describe the man only that I have never met anyone in my lifetime who had such a passion about this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#F00300","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2098,"content":"<p>Today has been very uplifting.  The witnesses spoke about stigma and discrimination.  I read in one of the reports that people with drug issues and drug problems are a target of moralistic judgments, and I often hear that as a Deputy in the community.

We will give them methadone, which is fine, and let them get out of town as quickly as we can get them out, and everything is back to normal.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask about methadone, given I only know what I hear, which is that 30% of patients have been attending drug clinics for more than 20 years.  As a question to Professor Barry, if methadone were withdrawn, and there are those in the community who say it should be, what would be the outcome?  I understand the issue of education, but education and issues like housing are long-term solutions, although we have to work towards that.  In the short term, if methadone were withdrawn, what would be the result?<\/p> <p>  The service in a town is called the drugs clinic, which I think is a terrible name.

It vital that we keep recovery as the optimum aim for people in addiction.  Harm reduction measures certainly have a role to play but they cannot be at the expense of full recovery for individuals.  It is only when we see people in recovery that we realise the difference it makes to their lives.  Although harm reduction measures are important, sometimes it is almost like throwing in the towel when it comes to addiction.  We can give a person a needle exchange or methadone and do this, that and the other, but the person continues in their addiction.<\/p> <p>  Professor Barry mentioned the north inner city drugs task force.  I acknowledge it was the very first to include a person from the user's forum, UISCE.  They were listening to the voices of the users right from the very beginning in talking about this issue.<\/p> <p>  Back when heroin hit the north inner city, it gradually became a one-size-fits-all approach to recovery, and not even recovery, given the use of methadone.  I have no doubt methadone has saved lives but, because of what we have seen in terms of the increase and the variety of drugs, it is not the answer in many cases now.  What Mr. McAleenan has outlined today is very heartening.  It is only when we go to Soilse and the other projects I know in the north inner city and we see people in recovery that we can know the difference it makes to them, their families and their communities.  It is really important that recovery is with the Committee on Health and Children and it is to be hoped it is going to be central.<\/p> <p>  I am glad the fellowships and the 12-step programmes were mentioned because I do not think they get the credit they deserve.  They do not cost anything, except perhaps putting a euro in a bag at the end of the meeting, but they continue to do amazing work, as they have done through the years.  They have saved lives.<\/p> <p>  Accommodation is a major issue.  It became a crisis because of the other issues with homelessness.  I know we have a problem with accommodation, but when a person is in recovery, that should not be jeopardised by bringing people who are using and who have chaotic lives into the same accommodation.  I know about supported temporary accommodation.  If a person is in recovery, however, we cannot put a limit on how long they can stay in that accommodation.  For some people it might be three months, but for others it could be nine or ten months.  It must be based on the individual.  I know the difficulties with housing accommodation, but given the price people pay to get into recovery, we cannot jeopardise that.  While great work is being done with prisoners, if a person has become clean in prison by getting into a programme and going to a fellowship, only for them to be released and go back into homelessness, it is a recipe for disaster.<\/p> <p>  I ask that the committee would ensure that recovery would be part of whatever submission it makes or paper it sends to the national drugs strategy, and I ask that recovery would be at the heart of that strategy.  My own private focus at the moment is on prevention and education, which are undoubtedly the Cinderella of the national drugs strategy.  Perhaps that might be a debate for another day.

I have underlined the issues I think I need to cover, but if I forget anything, the committee members can let me know.  I have been involved in the drugs issue for about 20 years.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan outlined, methadone has a place - about that there is no doubt - and it has helped many families.<\/p><p>There was a review of the opiate treatment protocol carried out in 2010 by Professor Michael Farrell, who is a professor of addiction in the Maudsley in London.  Some type of public health approach is needed in most communities where there is opiate addiction, but it should not be the overall emphasis.  That review stated that there needed to be shift to promote recovery.  If we stopped prescribing methadone in the morning, we would have major problems.<\/p><p> We have discussed needs assessments and care workers, which Mr. McAleenan mentioned.  Every single person on methadone needs a full and proper assessment of his or her needs, desires and wishes, a point which needs to be repeated and has been recommended in several reports.  That is how I would approach the issue.  I may be wrong and Mr. McAleenan might disagree with me.  We agree on most things, but we do not necessarily agree on everything.  If one took methadone away, one would immediately have organisational problems.  Our approach is to focus on recovery.  They are not mutually exclusive, but the balance needs to shift in terms of resources towards recovery.  A person assessed on day one may have a certain opinion and may return in six months time to say he or she is ready or wants to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2106,"content":"<p>Have people been on methadone for 20 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#H00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2107,"content":"<p>Some people have been on it for 20 years.

Many people are now working with drug users.  Most are trying to move people along, but that requires more concerted action.  The model Mr. McAleenan mentioned needs to be available on a much more widespread scale.  People who do well and come off and stay off methadone do not necessarily want to be the poster boy or girl for recovery for the reasons of stigma we mentioned.  I would approach the issue of how many should be on methadone in terms of a thorough needs assessment of everyone.

As Deputy O'Sullivan said, we have had heroin in Ireland since the late 1970s.  In the 1980s the response to the problem was to tell people if they came off drugs, they would receive help, but that did not work.  Perhaps the approach was not well resourced, but there was chaos, riots, shootings and protests.  A structured drug service shifts drug users from dealing exclusively with a criminal environment and dealers to working with social care professionals, nurses, doctors and counsellors.  It involves a shift in emphasis to recovery.  One will not do everything in one day.  We would like this issue to be taken on board and to have a genuine implementation plan.  That would make a significant difference.<\/p> <p>  In terms of measuring outcomes and the register, which Deputy Byrne mentioned, there is a register of people on methadone and it has been recommended in numerous reports that there should be data linkage to follow, with appropriate privacy protections.  That has not happened, and not just in the drugs area.  I do some work with the HSE and I am quite often asked to answer parliamentary questions.  We receive questions on the success of a programme or what is happening.  It is very difficult to measure some outcomes if one has no way of following someone on a longitudinal basis.<\/p> <p>  The Health Identifiers Act is not enough.  There needs to be a next stage, which is a step that has long been advocated outside of the Oireachtas.  If we want to measure outcomes in the health services generally, the next stage of the legislation needs to be commenced.  The only information available is on cancer, and the national cancer registry can measure outcomes and survival rates because it is a good register which is appropriately staffed and confidential.  We need something like that for drugs services.<\/p> <p>  I refer to legalisation, decriminalisation and considering things in another way.  Legalisation and decriminalisation are different.  I do not think drugs should be a criminal issue, but that is not to say that I would support legalisation.  Members may remember head shops opening in 2009.  People who had never thought of taking drugs took them when they were legal.  The world is made up of two types of people, those who are risk takers and those who are risk averse.  We would have a much larger problem with pills than we currently have with other substances if we legalised them.  Decriminalisation is different.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McAleenan will discuss recovery academies.  In terms of an all-Ireland approach, we currently have 14 local drugs task forces in the Dublin area, including Bray, and Pat Carey is the chair of one.  I have worked on this issue for 20 years and it has been a genuine cross-party initiative.  We have had Ministers and Ministers of State from three parties involved.  It helps to have a focus because it is not just about medicine and clinical matters but a much wider issue encompassing homelessness and so on.<\/p> <p>  We have ten regional drugs task forces.  In each part of the country there is a structure of people who are trying to help, but that is not enough.  There is a framework and more of a consensus, which is not absolute, among those working in the area that we need to do things differently.  We all need a wake-up call, which is what this is about.<\/p> <p>  Mental health was mentioned, which is a major issue.  The dual diagnosis rate is about 30%.  Some 30% of those who use opiates have mental health issues.  The Vision for Change document excludes addiction, which is crazy and needs to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2112,"content":"<p>What is crazy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#H00800","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2113,"content":"<p>A Vision for Change is a blueprint document on mental health which is quite good in many ways, but it explicitly excludes dealing with addiction which does not make sense.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if I covered everything.

What we are discussing today was known 30 or 40 years ago.  A paper written by Gerald Bury in 1979 stated heroin affected the communities which had the least ability to deal with it the worst.  Ever since then the problem has involved trying to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked about individual care pathways.  Everyone should have an individual care plan, key worker, case management, SMART goals and the totality of their needs named and actioned.  That is the approach we take in our work.  Within a two-year spectrum, a person can go from being on the streets to being in recovery, off drugs and engaging in daytime programmes, housing and quality-of-life issues.<\/p> <p>  On decriminalisation and legalisation, we mention in the report the issue of spent convictions.  One woman mentioned in the case studies discussed her life.  She went to college when she finished using drugs in 2003 and got a degree.<\/p><p>Again, as there was a drug experience and prior convictions, she has lost several jobs.  She is drug free for 12 years but it is still an issue that reappears.  We advocate along the lines that the spent convictions Bill should address people who are in recovery and enable them after a period, such as five years, to have a conviction quashed.  Generally, if a person is drug free for five years, there is more than a 90% chance that he or she will be drug free for the rest of his or her life.<\/p><p> There are other jurisdictions and models and, as I noted, we are involved in a European project.  There is a dearth in responses in the countries we are discussing, including ourselves, England, Romania, Cyprus and Italy.  This relates to access to learning programmes or work options.  If we are talking about recovery and normalising people's lives, these are key elements that redefine how people see themselves.  That is important.  We have examined other European countries, and Spain, for example, has co-operatives where people can set up and train for the first year before getting a business start-up in the second year and becoming independent in the third year.  This exemplifies the social economy options in other countries that are very viable.  We have never had a cultural tradition of co-operatives in Ireland.  On the Continent, there are approximately 300,000 co-operatives with 60 million people working in them.  We are involved with Italy and that country works with a co-operative model.<\/p><p> There may be other models and there are certain models regarding housing.  In England, it is very much like a continuum of care.  If a person is detoxing, he or she can go to a housing facility and when that person is drug free, he or she goes to another facility in the recovery community with people who are drug free.  Those people can move to permanent accommodation afterwards.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the housing issue.  There are models we can consider.<\/p><p> There is the question of how to move this forward.  We are talking about events on the ground and Professor Barry mentioned a Minister with responsibility for drug issues with respect to the task force in the north inner city.  It is relevant across the city.  On the ground, the feeling is that the issue is off the political agenda.  Having a Minister with responsibility for drug issues is important.  The next drugs strategy should be oriented to a recovery paradigm, and again that will send a message to services that we must focus on more integrated qualitative approaches in how we do our work and delivery.  We must be more ambitious for service users, focus on outcomes and ensure people are not languishing for years in medication processes.  Quality of life issues must be addressed.<\/p><p> The narratives of people in recovery will give us insight and guidance and provide hope, demonstrating that recovery does happen.  That is part of the issue on the ground, as people do not believe that recovery happens.  When one is stuck in a void for years, all one can see is the recycling of failure.  We must promote recovery and demonstrate that success does happen.  By addressing stigma, making this more of a public issue and getting people who have gone through it successfully talking about their experiences, we can hope that, in turn, it will infuse the idea and notion in others.<\/p><p> There is an implementation committee and there has been an attempt to try to implement what is laid out through strategies and documents.  The big challenge is to get key agencies working together.  The HSE does its work well with respect to methadone and the process has plateaued.  The required people are in place now.  As we heard earlier, we need to work with the likes of the housing bodies because there is a massive homelessness problem.  We need to work with the mental health services, with what is now SOLAS and with the education and training boards.  There is poor educational attainment and a consequent lack of marketability and progression options.  For example, literacy is also a problem.  Dyslexia stands out, and we have found it is far more common within our cohort than within the general population.  There is a dearth of response, as there is only one project in Dublin dealing with the issue.  These are the elements facing us in the implementation area.  A small but empowered group of approximately five or six senior people can make these decisions and get these matters progressed.  It would be an effective working group.<\/p><p> Mr. Pat Carey, the north-east drugs task force chairman, visited our project before Christmas.  He was there for more than three hours and went back over some of what he would have liked to have happened when he was Minister.  The housing issue was important to him as he pioneered housing changes and policies, and he said the process had gone in a direction he did not foresee.  He does not believe it is conducive to the needs of people.  Outcomes in the housing area are very important.<\/p><p> There is an array of clinical services, with counselling offered to people and other interventions concerning mental health needs or any other medical conditions.  Detoxification is also offered along with residential treatment.  There was a report in 2007 by Dr. Corrigan and Dr. O'Gorman which indicated we should elaborate on the options for bed capacity in the detoxification and residential treatment areas.  If we are to make a major change and liberate people from services, there must be options for moving forward.  We need more residential beds and detoxification options.  The 2007 report is good and comprehensive.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan spoke eloquently about recovery and that supports the notion of getting this discourse going in the north inner city.  That is appreciated.  We can see a change, even at task force level, with people looking at outcomes.  It may sound trite despite the times we live in but one of the goals for all the projects has been for everyone in the services to have a meal every day.  That is the basic level we are talking about when we are starting to work with people.  It is about getting them some nourishment, something to do during the day and getting a roof over their heads at night.  It is about getting some company and friendship.  These are the basic needs we start with and people respond to this, buy in and become inspired.<\/p><p> There is an issue with prisoners and we should be far more effective in dealing with them, planning for their release and having the array of options we are talking about.  There are planned releases but there must be work and education options when prisoners are released.  They should have other support as well.  I spoke about a model involving a recovery coach, which would be a good link or buddy system for people when they emerge from prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry McAleenan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2116,"content":"<p>I apologise that I was not present for the beginning of the presentation.  I pay tribute to the great work ongoing in the area of drug rehabilitation and treatment, harm reduction and population safety.  When I was elected to the Seanad a few years ago, I set off on a personal series of fact-finding missions.  I visited Merchant's Quay, Hyde Park and other treatment centres.  Quite a few people came to chat with me.  I feel quite strongly about drug policy and we are doing it wrong.  I am delighted to hear some of the opinions aired at this meeting.<\/p> <p>  I like to think I am a rationalist and an empiricist.  One does a bit of research, looks at the results and sees if something has worked.  What we have done in the war on drugs has clearly not worked, and by any logical definition what the western countries in general have done in trying to contain the drugs problem and reduce the associated harm, particularly to individuals with drug problems, has not been successful.  We have as high a number of drug addicts as we have ever had.<\/p> <p>  I get accused of a little inconsistency in this but we can consider the different types of substance problems, and one size does not fit all.  We should be aiming for the elimination of legal commerce in tobacco at some fixed stage in the future.  If people want to sell tobacco at that point, they will not be doing it in a boardroom in New York or London but in the way the Medellin cartel does its business.  It would not be feasible.  As a society we need to acknowledge that we probably drink two or three times too much compared with what we used to, and in individual cases this may be much more or else just fine.  We need to reduce the number of units of alcohol consumed in society.<\/p> <p>  The different forms of illegitimate non-alcohol and non-tobacco drugs have different problems as well.  I have always been of the opinion that opiate or opioid heroin or morphine addiction is a specific problem.  I saw some data approximately two years ago that suggested if we considered a timeframe before the economic bubble, during it and afterwards, cocaine use went up as we got more money and went down as we lost it.  Heroin use, on the other hand, stayed the same, which told us something very powerful about heroin.  Heroin addiction is as much a medical problem as cancer or diabetes, and the treatment must be medical.  I took a tremendous amount of a flak a couple of years ago when I suggested that we medicalise heroin.  It is something we need to consider.<\/p><p> I apologise for my absence earlier.  The delegates may have given us the figures, but do we know how many heroin or opiate addicts there are in Ireland and how many are regularly engaged with treatment, rehab and other services?  I have kept asking this question and nobody seems to be clear on it, but I get the sense that many are not engaged with services.  For some, this is owing to a lack of access.  When I first came here, I was surprised to discover how centralised methadone services were and that many people on methadone programmes had long commutes to access them, which is a disincentive in some cases.  How many of those who are not engaged with services are not engaged because methadone does not do it for them and they still want heroin?  How many of those outside our net of interaction with caring social, medical and rehabilitation services and are instead buying drugs on the street from some of the worst elements of society could be brought into the net if we were giving them heroin and not methadone?  There is an element of a guesstimate in this regard.  I thank the delegates for what they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#J00200","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2118,"content":"<p>In Ireland we use a capture-recapture methodology to estimate the numbers of problematic opiate users.  It has been done three times in Ireland, in 1996, 2001 and 2007, and is being examined again by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, NACDA.  It is done by counting the persons in receipt of methadone treatment, the people on charges with the Garda and those who have been in an acute hospital and using mathematic modelling.  We know how many problematic opiate users there are and, depending on the size of the overlap, we estimate the number of hidden users.  It is technical.  According to the most recent estimate, there were approximately 14,000 to 15,000 problematic opiate users.  Some of them would not take much heroin, for example, those who are participating in methadone programmes but also taking a little heroin as they are still addicted to opiates.  Approximately two thirds are reckoned to be in treatment or contact with services.  Of the one third outside treatment, I can only speculate.  Some do not want to have any contact with the State and the HSE, as people in low threshold programmes tell us.  They are taking drugs - people take drugs for many reasons.  In Dublin the level of  access to treatment is high and outside Dublin it has improved.  Most people who are not engaged are not engaged because it is not attractive.  Some would engage if they were to receive heroin instead of methadone.  On a cost-benefit analysis, it would not be very effective to do this.<\/p> <p>  Patterns of use have changed.  Injecting was the norm in the 1990s, but it is less common now.  The culture has changed, as drugs go out of fashion.  Opiates have gone out of fashion somewhat, but stimulants are a major problem.  Given that there is no opiate response to these non-opiate drugs, we need to provide a psycho-social response to them.  There are heroin droughts from time to time and we see many changes.  Heroin supply is controlled by the criminal gangs.  Some opiates such as morphine are given in medical settings.  Morphine is a good drug in treating certain conditions.  Although specialists in palliative care use methadone for pain relief, it is not part of the methadone protocol.<\/p> <p>  We are asking that the time be shortened between a person being on the street and entering recovery.  Mr. McAleenan referred to a period of two years and knows much more about it than most people or I do.  We are talking about narrowing the gap and then reappraising.  Given that every policy change can have unintended consequences, we must examine the upsides and downsides of everything.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned prevention and education, which are important.  In the parts of the country where heroin use is most common, particularly Dublin, the vast majority of youngsters do not take opiates.  Among those who do, there is a pattern of early school leaving.  If I could do one thing to try to reduce the need to take psychoactive substances, it would be to improve the level of school retention.  Many children do not make the transition from primary to secondary school.  We have forgotten what it is like.  While primary school is very sheltered, secondary school is a completely different environment into which young people are thrown and some just fall and cannot sustain it.  I would also invest more in preschool services.  Other European countries put much more emphasis on it.  We need to invest in children if we want to reduce the chances of people taking drugs, but we will never eliminate drug use.  There are many issues related to marginal benefits such as giving people self-esteem and teaching them skills.  While the schools SPHE programme can and does do it, there is a limit to what it can do if the child's environment is moving in a different direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2119,"content":"<p>This morning we have heard about the theory of recovery.

It might not take a huge amount to flip the coin around in order that when somebody addicted to opiates presents to the health service, the professionals will sit down with him or her in a few sessions and outline the options to genuinely involve him or her more.  Equally, issues such as dyslexia and so on can be game changers.  The devil is in the detail of the assessment which has to have a recovery focus.

We welcome this Bill as a watershed in that it represents the first time that the Department of Health is introducing legislation on the public health aspects of our national alcohol problem.  I will concentrate on issues relating to labelling and minimum unit pricing.<\/p> <p>  I have been involved in the issue of labelling and warnings through a variety of working groups since the middle of the last decade, beginning with social partnership.  Agreement was reached on labelling in 2007, eight years ago, so this legislation is overdue.  It is encouraging to see recommendations of almost ten years ago progressing towards the Statute Book.  There is confusion currently about the exact quantity of alcohol in any alcoholic drink.  The move to use grams is a step in the right direction.  Grams are used to label foods all over Europe and represent the same thing in Ireland, the United Kingdom and continental Europe.  Grams are understandable in many languages.  Importantly, there is a direct dose response effect between daily intake of grams of alcohol and a variety of alcohol induced health harms.  A pint of beer contains 20g of alcohol.  If a man drinks 50g to 60g of alcohol every day, his chance of developing liver cirrhosis is increased ninefold.  If a woman drinks 20g to 40g of alcohol per day, her chance of developing liver cirrhosis is increased almost tenfold.  Epilepsy is increased sevenfold for each gender with each of these intakes.  We have a major obesity problem in Ireland and information on the calorie count on alcohol containers will help with weight control.  A pint of lager contains more than 200 calories, a standard 175 ml glass of wine, one quarter of a bottle, contains 130 calories, and a pub measure of spirits contains 80 calories, minus the mixer.  Accurate information on grams and calories, coupled with images of the harms caused by excess alcohol use, will greatly help individuals take a more proactive role in monitoring their alcohol consumption.<\/p> <p>  The topic of minimum unit pricing has been discussed at length by Dr. Holmes from Sheffield.  This is a proven effective measure with gains in the short term.  It is aimed at two groups of vulnerable drinkers: very young drinkers or teenagers who can buy drinks, particularly beer, at pocket money prices, and dependent drinkers or alcoholics for whom any very cheap alcohol is very attractive.  The benefits in the short term include reductions in mortality, reductions in crime, a positive impact on the direct costs to health care services and a reduction in workplace absence.  Helping young people to delay the onset of heavy drinking, and any drinking, reduces their chances of developing alcohol dependence in later life.<\/p> <p>  It has been claimed that this strategy is an attack on the poor.  That is not the case.  It is an attempt based on evidence to provide support to vulnerable drinkers to reduce their drinking regardless of their economic circumstances.  I am the chairperson of the north inner city local drugs task force, in which Members of the Oireachtas from the Dublin Central constituency and members of Dublin City Council actively participate.  We are all of the view that drinking patterns in the north inner city, one of the most deprived parts of the country, are at a serious level, with a proliferation of off-licences selling cheap drink.  The measures outlined in this minimum unit pricing legislation will be very beneficial to the health and well-being of this community and all communities throughout the country, regardless of social class.  It will lessen health inequalities when brought in.<\/p> <p>  The final issue I would like to address briefly is enforcement, which cuts across some of the heads.  I welcome that environmental health officers will be given enforcement powers under this legislation.  They provide excellent enforcement within the health arena regarding environmental tobacco smoke and food safety.  They will have a key role in enforcing section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which deals with structural separation in mixed trading stores.  Alcohol is not an ordinary commodity and must not be treated as such by our retailers.  We thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2136,"content":"<p>I, too, thank the committee for the invitation to appear today.  It is a substantial achievement to have brought this legislation forward.  The measures it contains have the potential to save many lives and make our society a healthier, safer and better one in which to live.  As Professor Barry has focused on labelling, pricing and enforcement, and members have also heard a detailed presentation on minimum unit pricing from Dr. John Holmes, I will focus on alcohol marketing and advertising, including the sponsorship of major sporting events by alcohol brands.<\/p> <p>  The history of alcohol regulation in Ireland is not one of which we can be proud. We have paid, and continue to pay, a very heavy price for this.  We are the second heaviest binge drinkers in the world and our children are growing up in a society where three people die every day due to alcohol.  It is a society in which liver disease rates are spiralling, increasing fourfold in the past 20 years, with the greatest level of increase among 15 to 34 year olds, in which more than 100,000 children are suffering due to a parent&rsquo;s drinking, and in which alcohol is a prominent driving factor in serious issues such as crime, suicide and mental illness, as well as a huge burden on our under-pressure health service and State finances.  Prior to the public health (alcohol) Bill the lack of action on alcohol harm is a stark reflection of how we have normalised not only heavy and harmful drinking in Ireland but also the huge costs that come with it, primarily the loss of so many lives and the serious harm suffered by young and vulnerable members of society due to alcohol.<\/p> <p>  Many people seem to ask why so many children and young people in Ireland start to drink so early and then drink so often and so much, habits which sadly stay with the majority of Irish people into their adult life.  When it comes to drinking, young people are, in many ways, a product of their environment and we have created an environment for them that is saturated with alcohol, so much so that many of us fail even to recognise it anymore and are willing to turn a blind eye to the harms that come with it.  As Dr. Patrick Kenny pointed out to the committee on Tuesday, there is no longer any debate surrounding the impact of alcohol marketing and advertising, including sponsorship, on children.  A significant number of large studies which tracked children over time, measuring their exposure to marketing and their alcohol consumption, have shown that the more alcohol marketing to which children are exposed, the more likely they are to start to consume alcohol and to drink more if they have already started consuming alcohol.<\/p> <p>  Only vested interests continue to deny this evidence while simultaneously spending millions finding more creative ways to reach and engage people and influence them to drink their products.  Even if we were to accept that children are not targeted directly by the alcohol industry, to say that children are not influenced by alcohol marketing is equivalent to saying that they only suddenly begin to see and hear on their 18th birthday.  Sport, in which we quite rightly encourage children to participate, both for the physical benefits of exercise and the many other important values it can teach them, is one of the primary vehicles the alcohol industry uses to sell its products in Ireland.  Sponsorship of sporting events by alcohol brands is an especially potent form of sales promotion, and comprehensive evidence shows that children are not only exposed to a large amount of alcohol promotion through sports sponsorship, but that their beliefs and behaviour in relation to alcohol are influenced by the alignment of alcohol brands with their sporting heroes and everything they represent.  Every day Irish children are continually exposed to positive, risk-free images of alcohol and its use in many different ways and through many different channels, including social media, television, billboards, sports sponsorship, product placement in films and music videos.  These all work to reinforce one another and are sophisticated and powerful influences on children&rsquo;s drinking expectations and behaviour.  Ultimately, they all work together to sell more alcohol.<\/p> <p>  Due to the failure to introduce effective regulations and legislation governing this area, the alcohol industry has in effect become Irish children and young people&rsquo;s primary educator on alcohol.<\/p><p>Therefore, proposals to place existing voluntary codes governing alcohol advertising and alcohol sponsorship of sport on a statutory footing are deeply concerning.  To date, regulation of the promotion of alcohol has been structured and undertaken by the alcohol industry itself, mainly through these voluntary codes of practice.  The alcohol industry writes the rules it sees fit to adhere to and decides whether they are being obeyed.  Like most systems of self-regulation in Ireland, the alcohol industry&rsquo;s codes have proven to be wholly ineffective and have done nothing to protect the young and vulnerable members of society from alcohol harm. <\/p><p> Self-regulation is no regulation.  We did not allow the tobacco industry to regulate itself and the robust legislation put in place by Government in relation to tobacco, including marketing, advertising and sponsorship, has seen the number of Irish children taking up smoking fall significantly.  If the Government fails to act to phase out alcohol sponsorship of sport and allows the existing self-regulatory codes governing marketing and advertising to pass, unexamined by independent experts in public health, onto the Statute Book, it will have allowed the alcohol industry to write the law that governs alcohol marketing and advertising in Ireland and spurned the opportunity to make a significant difference to the health and well-being of future generations of Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2138,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to address the committee.  As the committee will be aware, we represent the publicans in the 25 counties outside Dublin and have a membership of approximately 4,000.  These publicans are dotted throughout the country, in urban and rural areas, and provide much-needed employment on the one hand and tourist infrastructure on the other.<br\/><br\/>We broadly welcome the provisions as set out in this Bill.  Many of its provisions have been sought by our federation for a long period.  What is important is that the details of the Bill are considered carefully and are implemented in a way that achieves its full aims without unintended consequences.  There are four main areas provided for in the Bill: health labelling of alcohol products, minimum unit pricing for retailing of alcohol products, regulation of marketing and advertising of alcohol, and enforcement powers for environmental health officers in relation to some of these provisions.<br\/><br\/>On the health labelling of alcohol products, we have no problem supporting the objectives set out in the Bill.  As we understand it, it would be the responsibility of manufacturers to ensure all bottles, cans and other containers contain the relevant information.  In the on-trade, it would be the responsibility of the licensee to display a notice prominently inside the premises with the information required.  It is imperative a standardised format be agreed for this notification.  We need to avoid different administrative officers having different impressions of what is required.  This standardised format should be agreed in advance with the Department of Health to ensure ease of compliance and full disclosure for the consumer.<br\/><br\/>We fully support the principle of minimum unit pricing.  To be effective it needs to be set at a rate that will achieve the stated objectives.  The Department of Health has indicated that the minimum unit price will be exclusive of VAT and excise.  We fail to see how this can operate.  If the minimum price is exclusive of VAT and excise, it will be meaningless unless it is pitched at an enormously high level.  It will be meaningless in that supermarkets may decide, when it suits them, to absorb the excise and they will continue to use alcohol as a loss leader.  We believe the rate should be the final rate below which alcohol cannot be sold.<br\/><br\/>We believe there has to be a logic as to how this rate is arrived at.  We would suggest that the appropriate logic is to go back to before the abolition of the groceries order in 2006, which was the catalyst for most of the problems in this area today.  The average price from the CSO figures at that point should be taken and the rise in the cost of living overall in the interim should be applied to reach a new minimum unit price.  This would equate to a minimum unit price of approximately &euro;1.90 per 500 ml can of beer at 4.3% alcohol by volume.  This figure should then be used <i>pro rata<\/i>for other products like wine, spirits, etc. on the basis indicated in the Bill of the price being based on a certain number of cent per 10 grams of alcohol.  We believe that is a significant issue that needs to be addressed in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the control of marketing and advertising of alcohol,<b><\/b>by and large the issues raised in the Bill do not affect the on-trade and are more centrally issues for brand owners than for the pub trade.  However, we have a concern with certain elements in head 9, specifically subsection (3)(g) which states: &ldquo;A requirement that an advertisement for an alcohol product shall include a notice or statement containing health information&rdquo;.  The committee will be aware that outside of many pubs there are signs, many of which are there for generations, denoting product types and brands.  These particular signs do not have that health information or are not amenable to having that information superimposed.  While we do not believe it is the intention of the proposed Bill to affect such signs, it could be interpreted by those charged with the responsibility of implementing the measures in the Bill that these signs could be affected.  We would ask that this be specifically addressed in the final Bill.<br\/><br\/>Head 15 of the Bill refers to section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  It allows for environmental health officers to enforce section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act if and when the Bill is enacted.  Our position is that section 9, which covers the segregation of alcohol in mixed trading outlets, that is, supermarkets, should be brought into play immediately.  However, in recent discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality, which I understand has jurisdiction in this matter, it has indicated that it has no intention to commence section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 any time soon.  Instead, it intends to put the current voluntary code of practice on a statutory footing for a two-year period and then assess its success or otherwise.<br\/><br\/>The problem with this is that no one is designated to monitor its enforcement during this two-year period.  We suggest the current legislation needs to be amended to allow for the environmental health officers to monitor the workings of the statutory code of practice during the two-year period in order that a valid and objective assessment can be made of its implementation.<br\/><br\/>We support the objectives and the broad content of the heads of the Bill.  We would like to ensure there are no unintended consequences as I have highlighted and that the legislation will be implemented without delay.  We believe that addressing the points raised will strengthen the Bill, improve outputs and result in a better situation all round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Cribben"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2139,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  The National Off-Licence Association, NOffLA, represents independent, specialist and pure off-licences, generally owner-operated, community-based, and employing local expertise.  As alcohol is our primary product, it is a mandatory requirement for membership of NOffLA that all members are trained and examined in NOffLA&rsquo;s responsible trading certificate.  Failure to adhere to the law is not an option for us as loss of licence is loss of livelihood.<br\/><br\/>NOffLA welcomes the commitment to implement structural separation in tackling under-age exposure to alcohol, the calculated placement of alcohol products with other groceries, and sale of alcohol through self-service terminals.  Alcohol is a controlled substance whose purchase must be a conscious decision, transacted under the strictest conditions and supervision. <br\/><br\/>NOffLA queries why structural separation will not be enacted under the law already in place, that is, section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  The scheme plans to achieve the same principles of section 9 through a statutory code under the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  The sanctions set out under the statutory code are notably weaker than section 9 and, as such, will pose much less of a deterrent.  For example, a breach of the statutory code provisions is not a criminal offence but merely a possible basis upon which an objection to licence renewal can be made.  A breach of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008<i><\/i>can result in a summary conviction and a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000.  These sanctions represent a much more powerful deterrent than a possible objection at renewal time.  This proposed code will see continued non-compliance by mixed traders.  NOffLA views the undertaking to enact section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act after two years as something that should be commenced now.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Bill will amend section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 which will allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to make regulations to restrict certain advertisements and promotions.  In the absence of a ban on below invoice cost selling, section 16 can be implemented.<br\/><br\/>NOffLA accepts that alcohol marketing needs to be regulated.  The restriction on alcohol advertisements in the media in relation to volume and type of publication is a vital step in establishing a responsible retailing platform.  Minimum pricing in isolation will not tackle irresponsible promotions because premium branded alcohol can still be heavily discounted.  Many of the promotions in the media currently are priced at a level that will still be legal under minimum unit pricing.  Indirect marketing is not an appropriate tool for the sale of alcohol.  Alcohol should not attract loyalty points, money back vouchers and meal deals, and promotions earned on groceries, petrol and so on should not be applied against alcohol purchases.<br\/><br\/>NOffLA welcomes the policy change on alcohol pricing away from excise duty while still addressing the issue.<\/p><p>Excise duty increases upfront cash requirements and therefore costs jobs.  We support the introduction of minimum unit pricing, MUP, and see it working at approximately &euro;1 or more.  Some might wish it to be higher but we must be conscious of the proportionality of the measure on health grounds versus the freedom of movement of goods under EU law for it to have any chance of approval.  However, there is no backup plan should it prove illegal or to address the fact that minimum unit pricing does not deal with the discounting of premium brands.  Minimum unit pricing targets one socio-economic group and age profile.  The legislation is an opportunity to introduce a ban on below invoice cost selling, which will work in tandem with MUP to ensure alcohol is sold responsibly across all social strata and ages.<\/p><p> Appendix 4 in the submission shows that minimum unit pricing and banning below invoice cost selling have complementary merits.  Where minimum unit pricing legally permits a six pack to be discounted by &euro;4.50 from its invoice cost, this could not happen with a ban on below invoice cost selling.  Appendix 6 highlights that while some supermarket promotions may not be legal under minimum unit pricing, the discounting of premium brands will continue untouched.  A ban on below invoice cost selling would also save the State an estimated &euro;24 million in VAT rebates per annum.  NOffLA suggests that a ban on below invoice cost selling using the regulation in section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 prohibiting the sale of alcohol at a reduced price would be very useful.<\/p><p> This Bill has potential but it might be a missed opportunity if section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 continues to be unimplemented or if section 16 continues to permit the sale of alcohol below invoice cost price.  I wish to add a note of caution from someone who had high hopes for the reforms in 2008.  In appendix 1 members will see that we are in the current position as a direct result of decisions taken by the Department of Justice and Equality to deregulate certain laws and not to enact others, all of which have had a negative consequence from a health perspective due to increased availability.  I ask the committee to be vigilant in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Evelyn Jones","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2141,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to address the committee on the heads of the public health (alcohol) Bill.  I am the director of the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI.  We represent manufacturers and distributors of alcoholic beverages on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To give the members some background information on the sector, in economic terms it generates in excess of &euro;2 billion in excise and VAT receipts annually for the State, makes more than &euro;1 billion in purchases and has exports of more than &euro;1.2 billion.  It also supports in excess of 92,000 jobs in rural and urban Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The ABFI recognises that alcohol misuse, which manifests itself in harmful drinking, drinking to excess and under-age drinking, must be addressed.  The ABFI fully supports efforts to reduce alcohol misuse and welcomes the opportunity to engage with the Oireachtas on this important legislation.  We support the education of consumers to allow them to make the right choices about their alcohol consumption, and we support the use of evidence-based approaches that will reduce the harm associated with the abuse of alcohol.<\/p> <p>  The consumption of alcohol has fallen by approximately 25% over the past 15 years, based on Revenue Commissioners clearance and Central Statistics Office population data.  The most recent research from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs, ESPAD, showed under-age drinking in Ireland has declined across many metrics between 1999 and 2011.  While the trends are moving in the right direction, there is still much work to be done.<\/p> <p>  With regard to specific elements of the Bill, we welcome the intention to move the voluntary codes of behaviour on advertising, marketing and sponsorship to a statutory basis.  The voluntary codes already in existence work well and this move will strengthen them.  Marketing and sponsorship activities undertaken by companies operate under the principle of audience profiling.  This means that at least 75% of the audience for any marketing initiative must be older than 18 years of age.  We work closely with the Government and industry body, the alcohol marketing communications monitoring body, AMCMB, independently chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells, which has strict rules on the volume and placement of all alcohol advertisements in all media, that is, how much advertising and where an alcohol advertisement is permitted to be placed.  These codes were drawn up between the Department of Health and the industry and were reviewed and updated in 2008.<\/p> <p>  We also work with the Advertising Standards Association of Ireland the independent self-regulatory body set up and financed by the advertising industry and committed, in the public interest, to promoting the highest standards of marketing communications.  Since 2003, an independent pre-clearance house, CopyClear, has been in existence.  All advertising copy is sent for pre-clearance to CopyClear, a group of independent advertising professionals who vet any marketing for compliance with the ASAI codes on content.  This process is unique to Ireland.  No other market puts its alcohol advertising through such rigorous scrutiny to ensure it complies with both the letter and spirit of the codes.<\/p> <p>  The codes in operation today function well, and the ABFI welcomes the intention to move them to a statutory basis.  The statutory code system should cover the general areas of volume, content and placement.  There should be strict penalties for non-compliance with the codes.  There should be a strong and comparative evidence base for all measures arising out of the detailed information available on viewership and readership profiles.  The drafting of the regulations should involve a wide group of stakeholders, including the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and other regulatory bodies, to ensure the system functions correctly and does not unfairly disadvantage domestic media companies.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the proposal to introduce a watershed ban on advertising on television and radio, a watershed will only apply to domestic broadcasters.  It will not apply to broadcasters operating outside the jurisdiction.  A watershed will not apply to programming that is viewed on demand or online.  The ABFI restates its view that the best way to limit the exposure of those under 18 to alcohol advertising is through audience profiling.<\/p> <p>  Regarding structural separation, the ABFI welcomes the proposal in the heads of the Bill to move the Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland voluntary code to a statutory basis and to review the effectiveness of the code in two years.  We believe this takes into account the success of the code.  Compliance with the code is high, at 83% overall and 95% at multiple level in the latest annual report.  It is an example of an industry code that works well.<\/p> <p>  The ABFI welcomes appropriate labelling which enables the consumer to make informed decisions when purchasing alcohol.  The purpose of labelling on alcohol products, much like food, is for consumers to be provided with accurate information that is clear, consistent and easily understood.  The ABFI recognises that calorific information, when portrayed in a consumer-friendly and scientifically verifiable manner, is of use to the consumer.  The industry welcomes the Government&rsquo;s proposed introduction of labels indicating the dangers of drinking while pregnant.  In fact, some companies, such as Irish Distillers and Heineken, already do this on a voluntary basis.  The ABFI has consistently called on the Department of Health to introduce a requirement for this labelling since 2007.  It is essential the proposed inclusion of any health warning labels on packaged alcohol products is proportionate, measured and informative.<\/p> <p>  For consumers to understand the amount of alcohol they are consuming, the ABFI supports the inclusion of alcohol content information in the form of a standard drink or unit.  The proposed introduction of grams as the measure of alcohol content will confuse consumers and compromise their ability to make an informed decision when purchasing or consuming alcohol.  The research performed by Stockwell and Kerr that the heads of the Bill references also states that &ldquo;grams or other weight-based measures are unlikely to be useful in helping drinkers to understand alcohol&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>  Member states take their lead on alcohol labelling from EU legislation.  An EU committee is reviewing the potential for a harmonised unit at EU level.  It is also evaluating the various issues associated with alcohol products, specifically around nutrition and calories.  The Commission is expected to publish the findings of its research in a report due in 2015, and as the issues are being considered formally at EU level, now might not be the most appropriate time to develop national measures.<\/p> <p>  Regarding minimum unit pricing, the ABFI supports the Government&rsquo;s intention to address the sale of cheap alcohol.  In 2014, an industry-wide initiative called on the Government to address the sale of cheap alcohol, introduce a statutory ban on price-based advertising and introduce statutory codes to regulate the merchandising of alcohol.  There is full agreement in the ABFI that the best and quickest way to do this is by the reintroduction of a ban on below-cost selling of alcohol.  The ABFI calls on the Government to reintroduce the relevant section of the groceries order to deliver this.<\/p> <p>  Our view is that minimum unit pricing will be ineffective as a measure to address the sale of cheap alcohol.  It is based on a theoretical model with a multiplicity of assumptions, some of which might not be relevant to Ireland.  Specifically, the model deals with the impact of a change in price on demand for alcohol or price elasticity.  There is no price elasticity data available for Ireland.  The Sheffield report states: \"While we have attempted to estimate Irish-specific elasticities, the current data do not allow this to be done robustly\".  This calls into question the validity of the model for MUP that is used and the outputs it delivered in an Irish context, particularly how individual groups respond to changes in price, which is the foundation for the model and the conclusions drawn.  Minimum unit pricing is also currently before the European Court of Justice and it might be a number of years before its legality is ruled upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ross Mac Math&uacute;na"},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2142,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Mac Math&uacute;na to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#P00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2143,"content":"<p>Regarding education and the responsible serving of alcohol, these are two important elements which are not included in the Bill.

We are the representative organisation for the publicans of Dublin.  Collectively, our members sell almost 30% of the alcohol in the on-trade in Ireland and employ more than 12,000 people.<\/p> <p>  We broadly welcome the thrust of this Bill and feel that many of its provisions are long overdue.  I will outline specific comments on each of the main headings of the Bill.  With regard to head 5 &ndash; labelling of alcohol products, in principle, the LVA does not oppose the requirement that alcohol product containers set out the specified information.  However, we believe that the information about quantity in grams of alcohol will be of no benefit to consumers as they will not understand it.  We note that subhead 5(4) requires licensees with an on-licence to display a notice prominently inside the premises setting out this information.  We believe that this is the most appropriate and feasible means for publicans to comply with the labelling requirements.  In addition, to minimise the administration and bureaucracy required to comply with the labelling requirement, we propose that a standard notice template be developed, in conjunction with the Department of Health, that sets out the required information by category rather than by brand.  This information would also be supplied by standard pub serving.  Providing this information by brand would be an administrative nightmare and prove overwhelming for consumers.<\/p> <p>  On head 6, the LVA fully supports the proposed introduction of a minimum price for alcohol.  In addition, we believe that the minimum price must be set at a high enough level to make a significant impact on consumption patterns.  The minimum price must be significantly higher than the off-trade market price levels in March 2015.  We also fully support subhead 1(e) but propose it should go further, namely, that alcohol should not be permitted to be sold as part of a so-called bundled offer under any circumstances.  Our concern is that the other bundled products would be deeply discounted to drive alcohol sales.  Such promotions could potentially be funded by the increased retailer margins under minimum price.  This scenario should not be permitted by the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The LVA argues that the policy objective under head 7, calculation of minimum unit price of alcoholic products, should be to return off-trade alcohol price levels to those existing at the time of the abolition of the groceries order in March 2006, adjusting for inflation in the intervening period.  Accordingly, based on CSO price levels applying at the time of abolishing the groceries order, and adjusting for inflation of 13.6% since, the rounded off-trade prices that should apply today should be: &euro;2 for a 500 ml can of lager, &euro;23.50 for a 700 ml bottle of vodka, and &euro;10 for a 75 cl bottle of table wine.  We understand that the minimum price will be exclusive of VAT and excise and that it is intended to be applied at the same rate, whether the alcohol is sold in beer, cider, spirits or wine form.  However, excise is levied at varying rates depending on the alcohol category involved.  Excise levels in Ireland are extraordinarily high and VAT at 23% is further applied to all alcohol categories.  The Government needs to take care that in the imposition of a minimum price, excise and VAT applies fairly and equally across all alcohol categories.  The LVA recommends that the focus be to achieve minimum retail prices, inclusive of the minimum price, excise and VAT, similar to March 2006 levels adjusted in real terms.  This may require the minimum price to vary by category.  Ultimately, the aim of a minimum unit price is to impact the retail price.  Accordingly, it needs to be communicated in retail price terms, including all taxes, to consumers and the public.  The retail price levels proposed will eliminate deep price discounting in all categories, and will have an immediate and direct impact on alcohol consumption levels and patterns.<\/p> <p>  Head 9 relates to the control of marketing and advertising of alcohol products.  The LVA supports the provision to prohibit the marketing and advertising of alcohol in a manner that is intended or likely to appeal to children.  The main brand owners are responsible in this regard.  We urge the Government to ensure a fair and appropriate balance between prohibiting advertising and marketing likely to appeal to children, which is a priority, and facilitating brand owners to invest in their brands and implement responsible advertising and marketing programmes.  We urge the joint committee to consider the prohibition of price-based advertising of alcohol as this would have a much more immediate and direct impact on consumer behaviour.<\/p> <p>  Head 15 concerns the amendment of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  The LVA's position is that section 9 of the 2008 Act should be commenced immediately.  Developing and implementing a statutory code for a two-year period is a poor substitute for full structural separation.  We believe there is no scenario where such a statutory code could prove more effective than structural separation.  The LVA notes that the current voluntary code operated and monitored by Responsible Retailing of Alcohol Ireland, RRAI, is completely ineffective.  Full structural separation would achieve the aim of dramatically reducing the visibility of alcohol in mixed trading retail environments.  In addition, the structurally separate unit must be required to have its own dedicated staff and its own customer pay points and till systems.  These are required to ensure there is specific staff accountability for alcohol retail sales, to facilitate specific staff training in the responsible retailing of alcohol and to provide for effective point-of-sale control.  This head provides environmental health officers with the powers to enforce the provisions of section 9 in the event of its commencement.  There appears to be no clarity on which State organisation or officers are responsible for enforcing the proposed statutory code on the display, sale, supply, advertising, promotion or marketing of alcohol, and this needs to be made explicit.<\/p> <p>  The LVA welcomes the publication of the general scheme of the Bill and supports many of its key provisions.  In particular, we urge the Government to ensure a minimum price, including excise and VAT, is achieved that results in significant change in consumer behaviour and purchasing patterns.  Returning alcohol prices, in real terms, to the levels that applied prior to the abolition of the groceries order is a rational approach and would be a positive step.  In addition, reducing the availability and in-store visibility of alcohol via structural separation is also essential and we urge the committee to recommend full structural separation in this regard.  There is no scenario where a statutory code would prove more effective than structural separation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2145,"content":"<p>I will have to leave shortly, as I am due in the Seanad to move a matter.  I note what has been said and will take into consideration all the viewpoints.  There seems to be an issue about the labelling of products.  I cannot envisage customers demanding the calorific or gram content of a pint of beer at midnight in a pub and I do not know if that is a huge issue.  It is a positive move and I do not see it placing a major burden on pubs.  The drinks industry can provide such labelling in the same way it provides free beer mats and so on.  Perhaps the information could be put on beer mats, although it probably would put people off their drink.<\/p> <p>  Previously, in a different role, I dealt with the issue of light alcohol.  I missed some of the submissions and this may have been mentioned.  Has the labelling of light alcohol ever been addressed?

I will focus on three issues: price, availability and promotion.  It is interesting to hear divergence in opinion on minimum unit pricing.  I will read up more about it and take these views into consideration.  We heard compelling evidence from Dr. John Holmes of the University of Sheffield, to whom some of the witnesses referred.  Perhaps the committee could put supplementary questions that have arisen today to him in order that he can give his perspective to members.  His evidence was compelling but I would also like to consider what today's witnesses have said.  Mr. Mac Math&uacute;na said the minimum unit pricing issue is before the European courts, but that is because the drinks industry is taking an action against the EU and, therefore, that will not stop me on the issue.<\/p> <p>  I have raised in the Seanad on several occasions the issue of structural separation of products because I strongly believe in this.  I do not understand why the Government has not moved to commence this section of the legislation.  I have a difficulty with putting the voluntary code on a statutory basis because legislation is in place.  It is a first in my experience for a Minister to have a choice provided for in legislation rather than having to make the choice before the legislation goes through the Oireachtas.  However, even with that provision, I do not understand why section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 has not been enacted.  The committee should take this into consideration when we discuss our feedback to the Minister.<\/p> <p>  I come to the issue of the promotion of alcohol wearing my children's rights hat.<\/p><p>I can understand that people will say that alcohol is not being marketed at children, but the evidence in the reports I am reading is that regardless of whether it is intentional, the fact is it is being marketed at children.  All the evidence that I in research clearly concurs with that point of view.  Dr. Patrick Kenny and Mr. James Doorley, deputy director of the National Youth Council, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, concur with that point.<\/p><p> The effect of sponsorship of sport by the alcohol industry, in particular the effect on children and young people, has been raised at the committee on a number of occasions.  We need to discuss how the committee can feed back this information.  I do not understand why we do not set a date and agree when the industry's sponsorship of sport should cease.  We all know the cessation of the link of alcohol to sports sponsorship will come in the future.  We need to look at that issue.<\/p><p> There is an issue with marketing and I have a difficulty with the code of practice.  Again, we heard that drinks industry advertising is limited at a bus stop, but we are all aware of the advertisement at successive bus stops.  Anyone driving or taking the bus will see the effects of advertising.  I see its effect on my young passengers whom I bring to school each morning.  In terms of the advertisements they see, having the advertisement appear at a succession of bus stops has an impact.  Another example is audience profiling.  One of the issues Mr. James Doorley raised on Tuesday is that if 1 million people watched a rugby match, approximately 250,000 could be under 18 years, so it will have an effect.  That is an issue for me.<\/p><p> I have a question on the role of education.  This was mentioned in the course of the presentations by the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland and Alcohol Action Ireland.  We are getting conflicting messages on education.  Certainly the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland supports the initiative of an education programme by DrinkAware in schools.  The HSE has been very involved recently with the revision of the social, personal and health education programme in schools.  Certainly I understand from the DrinkAware Trust in the United Kingdom that its experience is not what it has been purported to be in our reports.  Certainly the National Youth Council of Ireland says that education has a role, but it is not education that stops us speeding or changes behaviour.  I do not pick up my mobile phone in my car now.  I probably swear once a day about the current Minister for Health, who was the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who introduced legislation on the use of mobile phones in the car.  I knew it was wrong to use the phone.  I need the legislation to ensure I will not use my mobile phone when driving.  That is the reality, when I look at other areas, such as speeding and so on.  I would like to tease that point out further.  These are the questions I would like discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#Q00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2148,"content":"<p>I thank each of the delegates for their comprehensive and constructive presentations.

Would it be proposed to allow them three, six or 12 months or longer to carry out the changes?  What period should be allowed for that to occur?<\/p> <p>  The point was made that sporting organisations are dependent on sponsorship.  If the alcohol industry is banned from sponsoring sporting events or organisations, do the delegates think that part of the money raised from minimum pricing should be ring-fenced for sporting organisations?

The winners of the Young Scientist Exhibition this year conducted research into young people and their drinking habits.  In their project they raised the issue of the attitude of parents and how that affects children and their attitude to drink.  I understand they will appear before the committee and make a presentation on 16 April.  No matter what programme of education we provide, children are influenced by the attitudes of their parents.  We need to consider where we should focus our attention.  We can focus on schools, but do we need to do additional work by focusing it on parents?  How would we go about that?

People sent personal details to me.  I heard Professor Barry speak about drug addiction and in the course of the discussion he said there was no big difference between drug addiction and alcohol addiction.  I think what Professor Barry meant is that one has to deal with it in a similar way to an addiction.  It is a major medical problem.<\/p> <p>  I was not present when Ms Evelyn Jones made her presentation but I listened to it in my office.  Both Ms Jones and Mr. Donall O'Keeffe spoke about structural separation.  I have been in different shops and supermarkets where the point has been made to me that it will be a significant cost to put this in place and they raised issues on how will they regulate and watch this area.  Has Ms Jones an idea of the costs involved to a supermarket?  Minimum unit pricing is an important issue.  There is no point bringing in minimum unit pricing unless it is set at a realistic rate.  Will Ms Jones indicate what she thinks is a realistic minimum unit price?<\/p> <p>  We all know from the previous meeting on drugs that it comes down to parenting.  We all know that we should be responsible for our children.  We know they are binge drinking when they should be under our care.  As a parent and a former school principal, parents need to know where their children are.  It is no good complaining to Government or complaining that it is everyone's fault if they are out in the park binge drinking and then perhaps have to be brought to accident and emergency departments.  Parents are the primary carers of their children.  That is the message we have to send out.  It is all very well to say the school will do its part, and while I believe schools play their part, the primary educator of a child is the parent, and he or she is not just the educator but the carer as well.

The supermarket industry is a very strong lobby.  That is probably the reason it has not happened, which is shocking.  Cost should not come into it.  When the Government decided to ban smoking from pubs, did anyone ask publicans how much it was going to cost?  The alcohol for sale in supermarkets is far too cheap.  I remember photographs submitted to this committee two years ago of selection boxes on top of slabs of beer.  This issue has gone on far too long.

While education is important, regulation is required for certain things.  The reason drink driving has dropped is because of regulation.  I listened to the committee's live stream from Tuesday and it was mentioned why structural separation did not come in.  It was because interests lobbied a former Minister for Justice and Equality.  Comments were made about the Department of Justice and Equality with which I would agree.  We have sleepwalked into a situation where alcohol is way too available.  When we were all growing up, one bought alcohol in a pub.  After a while off-licences came into being, but now alcohol is everywhere.  Specialist off-licences and pubs are not the issue; mixed trading stores are the issue.  I agree with Senator Henry that the interests will not want change and they will raise the costs issue, as was raised this morning.

My understanding is it will be on packages.  A pint in a pub is different.  We want to get the public aware in a way currently it is not because of the alcohol by volume.  How much alcohol are we consuming?  It sounds like a no-brainer that we should have that information.  In fairness it was agreed by the industry as well under social partnership eight years ago, but it has not happened.  We are just moving along leisurely.  At least the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has put a Bill on the table and we welcome that.  It will help in reducing harm.  While everyone says they do not want harm, some of us, more than others, want less harm.  The minimum unit pricing is being challenged in the EU courts which does not imply that people see this in the same light.<\/p> <p>  Advertising works.  I have been at meetings over recent years where I have argued with advertisers.  I have been saying that advertising works and they have been trying to disagree with me.  It works and any human being who says they are not influenced by advertising is fooling themselves because most of it is subliminal.  We will not go near social media and yet that is where the real education is.  That is where young people are getting their information.  That cannot be regulated.  It is huge, and pop-ups can be done and so on.  The marketing spend by some companies in the industry is 20% on social media.<\/p><p>That is because this is the future and the area in which young people are engaged.  This issue has to be addressed also because it counters what students receive under the social, personal and health education programme.  <\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke referred to the Young Scientist competition.  Of course, parents are the primary educators, but in some situations there is a trend for them to be their children's friends.  They are meant to be their parents, not their friends, and there is a difference.<\/p><p> We are disappointed that the opportunity has not been taken to deal with the issue of sports sponsorship.  One committee member asked about the money being pumped into sports by the alcohol industry.  We do not know what the figure is.  I was part of the groups which dealt with the matter and during the years have come to know many of those involved on the alcohol side.  For commercial reasons they do not say how much is being spent.  Therefore, we do not actually know what the loss to sports organisations would be.<\/p><p> The national substance misuse strategy had rather modest aspirations.  It was published in 2012.  The idea was that it would be phased out from 2016 and no more by 2020; in other words, there is plenty of time for alternatives to be considered.  Surely, if the country is on the up, there are other companies, apart from those involved in the alcohol industry, that could support sports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#S01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2162,"content":"<p>I am keen to add to what has been said.  There have been some comments on the external environment and how we are all heavily influenced by it.  One of the major influences is advertising.  I do not want to bore people with a detailed examination of the codes, but I am keen to examine one aspect in particular, that is, audience profiling.  This tenet of the existing voluntary code is inherently flawed and it is worth bearing with me on the matter.<\/p> <p>  In audience profiling a threshold is set for the number of under 18 year olds who can be exposed to alcohol advertising.  It is rather limited in its ambition because it is set at 25%.  The reason this is difficult is that the population structure in Ireland is somewhat different from that elsewhere.  We have a larger number of children and young people.  A high threshold allows many children to be exposed to alcohol advertising without breaching the code.  For example, reference was made to a sports event with 600,000 viewers.  It could feature alcohol advertising, even if the viewership included 150,000 children and young people.  It should be borne in mind that babies and children under four years of years usually do not attend sports events and that children between the ages of five and 17 years account for 19.3% of the population over five years.  Therefore, some 19.3% of the attendees at a well-attended sports event could be children, which means that we would be well below the threshold.  It is virtually impossible, therefore, to breach the threshold for a sports event.  That is one of the flaws in the existing audience profiling figure and why we are suggesting the threshold ought to be brought down to 10%, similar to the figure in other countries, in particular, New Zealand.<\/p> <p>  There was a discussion about the alcohol monitoring communications body.  When it started, the idea was that there would be co-regulation, but in practice it is self-regulation.  Reference was made to the codes of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, to which Alcohol Action Ireland makes several complaints each year which largely are not upheld, but that could say more about us than it does about it.  I figured it would be useful to bring forward a case report.  We complained about a well-known alcohol brand.  Committee members are probably familiar with the advertisement which involves a small furry squirrel making beer in a cute acorn cup.  Within the code alcohol advertising is not supposed to appeal to children, but, generally, small furry animals appeal to children.  We made the complaint on the basis of what was included in the code, as well as on the reaction of my colleague's three year old daughter who ran at the screen shouting, \"Mummy, look at the squirrel.\"  Our complaint was not upheld.  The response of the advertiser was that the company took its commitment to market brands in a responsible way seriously.  It claimed that the campaign did not appeal to children based on the appearance of the squirrel which has been deliberately designed to look old, grey, wizened and dishevelled.  It also claimed that the animation was not cartoonish or Disney-like in nature but instead had a harder or older edge to it.  The argument was that this had been done to ensure the squirrel did not look cute or appeal to children.  The company stated the squirrel's character had been carefully crafted to appeal to adults, portraying it as crafty, experienced and nosy, not cute, comical or cartoonish.  The correspondence continued at length about the dark setting and the music chosen.  The company had chosen a Kaiser Chiefs song designed to appeal to adults rather than children and restated the audience profile of the band.<\/p> <p>  All of this is complete nonsense to me and really makes a mockery of regulation.  It does not do justice to the advertising industry and certainly does not do anything to protect children from this exposure.  That is why we believe so strongly in the need for an independent examination of the current codes which need to be strengthened.  Of course, the monitoring body needs to include people from the industry because of their expertise, but this is a health matter.  The regulations are to protect the health of children and young people.  Moreover, it is useful to reflect on the fact that the Government is committed to a long-term health strategy, Healthy Ireland, to create an environment in which people's health and well-being, including their physical health and mental well-being, will be priorities.  If the State is prioritising this issue, I imagine committee members should automatically see the relevance of these pieces and how they fit.  To achieve the goals of Healthy Ireland, we must have the constituent pieces that are robust and meaningful, rather than continue with this set-up.  I accept that the intent of advertisers may not be to target children, but that is the effect, particularly in cases such as the one I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2163,"content":"<p>I will deal with two or three issues that have been raised, the first of which relates to structural separation.

The strategic task force on alcohol was established in 2002 when this first became an issue.  Before that, it was not really seen as a problem, but it has been for approximately 15 years.  The general idea was that alcohol was not an ordinary commodity and that it was causing huge harm.  The feeling was that it should only be sold by people for whom it was their livelihood, whether it be a specialist off-licence or a pub.  It was recommended that there be no increase in the number of licences.  The mixed trading stores, whether they are multiples or corner shops, now present a huge problem.  One probably cannot take licences from people, but it is certainly possible to stop issuing new ones.  It has been obvious for a long time that the mixed trading stores are the problem.  The structural separation provision was lobbied against successfully six years ago.  That is the reason it is such a problem.  I was listening to what was said on Tuesday.  Obviously, the advertisers see alcohol as an ordinary commodity.

I will emphasise a few points for Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor on structural separation and minimum prices.  <\/p> <p>  On structural separation, it is our clear view that section 9 should be commenced immediately and that there should be full structural separation.  In addition, there would be a requirement to have dedicated staff rather than general retail personnel and a dedicated till system.  The operation should be that of a business within a business.  That would force the retailer to train staff specifically on their responsibilities and the responsible sale of alcohol and ensure clarity in enforcement, including who was responsible for selling to customers in the store.  Structural separation is not sufficient without a dedicated staff and till systems.  In our submission we have argued that the Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland is completely ineffective and a waste of time.  I do not understand why we would debate it at all.<\/p> <p>  With respect to minimum price, our figures are broadly similar to what has been put forward by other groups.  We propose a minimum price of &euro;2 per 500 ml can of beer and &euro;23.50 for a bottle of vodka which is 37.5% proof.  It would be &euro;10 for a bottle of wine.  That is based simply on taking the pre-groceries order price and adjusting for inflation.  The committee must think carefully about how to handle the issue of excise duty in this case, as excise duty rates vary by category, and for spirits and wine they are extremely high.  If there was a high minimum price of 90 cent and excise duty and VAT were loaded on top, the price could become completely unrealistic.  Focusing on a retail price to include the minimum unit price and excise duty and VAT must come to a retail price that customers will understand.

No good publican wants to have a pub full of customers who are out of control.  That is not an attractive environment and business will worsen if that is the case.  A publican wants to have an environment in which people can enjoy themselves and have a few drinks.  It is a social environment and it should be fun to be in it.  That is what good publicans strive to achieve.<\/p> <p>  Since the abolition of the groceries order, we have seen a fundamental shift in patterns of consumption from the on-trade to the off-trade.  When I joined the Licensed Vintners Association ten years ago, 70% of all alcohol was consumed in pubs and hotels.  Today, 60% is accounted for by the off-trade, while 40% is consumed in pubs and hotels.  That will shift to 70%:30% in the next five years.  We have public health issues because of the changing nature of consumption at home, as well as a changing product mix.  As people shift from pubs to the off-trade, they shift from beer to wine and spirits.  There are different public health concerns as a result.  The pub trade is absolutely the best environment in which to consume alcohol and good publicans take their responsibilities seriously.<\/p> <p>  Under the law, there are enforcement mechanisms.  Every year we see a publican or two or three in trouble with the Garda because of public order problems in enforcement.  That does not apply to off-trade sales.  Sanctions under the RRAI code are non-existent.  What is the penalty for not complying with the code?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#W02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donall O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1427362200,"counter":2248,"content":"<p>The presentation referred to the standard note to be developed on labelling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#W02100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2249,"content":"<p>There are 7,300 pubs and 1,000 hotels in the country, amounting to 8,300 individual businesses.

If we were to get into individual brands, we would have to give some of the bigger pubs up and down the country a booklet that would be completely disregarded by everybody as the information provided would be overwhelming.

We hear much about market share.  Alcohol companies have to create markets for good.  Alcohol is not necessarily for life, and good marketing creates a need for it.  Advertising targets competitors' customers but also tries to increase consumption by existing customers and recruit new customers.  It is important we remember this, given that it sometimes gets lost in the market share argument.  We talk a lot about alcohol brands sponsoring sports.  Increasingly, women's events, such as ladies' days and fashion shows, are being sponsored by alcohol brands.  This, too, is a particularly potent form of sponsorship.  There has been a complete change in women's drinking habits over the past ten years, and the association of alcohol brands, especially wine brands, with fashion shows and ladies' day events is very much part of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Costello"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2255,"content":"<p>Given that the alcohol companies are also chasing women for beer, it will be a future trend and another problem for women, on top of wine and spirits.  Alcohol consumption peaked in 2002.  The major contributor to the reduction occurred immediately after that when the Government was worried about alcopops and imposed a 20% excise duty on spirits.  Consumption decreased precipitously because of this.  It then reached a plateau and has increased in the past year.  It has not been dropping steadily but dropped because of legislation.  It has been mentioned today that perhaps we should defer to Europe on some of these matters.  This would be kicking the can down the road and we cannot do it.  We would be postponing it.<\/p> <p>  One of the greatest things a parent can do for his or children is delay the age at which they start drinking.  This must be an unambiguous message for parents.  It is a bad idea to introduce alcohol to children in the home.  Children who begin drinking at the age of 14 or 15 have a fourfold increase in dependency in adulthood.  This is why it is important the issue is taken more seriously than it has been through regulation balanced with education.  The Bill is not just about children but also adults.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015032600002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427362200,"counter":2256,"content":"<p>I wonder that anyone is surprised at women's consumption of wine, given that it is brandished under their noses every day when they go to the supermarket to buy the bread and milk for the house.
