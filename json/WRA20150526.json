I envisage an initial project where stakeholders will engage in partnership, in conjunction with the local business community.<\/p>  <p>  It was not possible to progress the initiative during 2014 due to the need to dedicate resources to other priority projects including the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and also to progress other ongoing projects, such as the judicial appointments review and the reform of the family law courts.

Work commenced on setting parameters for a pilot last week with a meeting brokered by my Department among the key Justice sector stakeholders. This meeting confirmed that a considerable amount of preparatory work will need to be undertaken in collaboration with all stakeholders - both within the Justice sector and the wider community of agencies and groups whose active participation and buy in will be necessary -  before the pilot project can be established successfully. Proper planning is essential and a needs assessment will first be undertaken to guide the identification of the goals and priority objectives of the pilot Community Court. It is also essential that the proposal is fully evaluated to ensure that it delivers the required results. Each of the stakeholders involved is operating with limited resources so the preparation and planning stages of the project are essential to ensure that the resources involved are used effectively. It is also important that the project would operate in a fully integrated way.

They have been asked to examine the papers in each case with a view to determining whether further action is warranted and practical.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 319 complaints were referred to the panel of counsel.  I should say that the volume and complexity of cases has led to the review taking longer than originally anticipated.  However, I'm sure that Deputies will agree that it is important that counsel take the time necessary to consider each case fully and carefully. Indeed, the very number and variety of cases makes the work of counsel all the more important.  There are many cases which have already been through some form of process, whether that involves the courts or GSOC or some other body.  The issues in the cases also range considerably, from tragic deaths to property disputes.  Clearly such a number and range of cases must be carefully triaged to see if further action is warranted.<\/p>  <p>  While the review of all the allegations is not yet completed, my Department has received the recommendations of counsel in a significant number of cases. I have now received the first batch of submissions on these cases and clearly I want to start the process of writing to everyone concerned as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I will consider the recommendations of counsel extremely seriously, and as a general comment let me say that I cannot easily imagine circumstances where I would not follow such recommendations.  In communicating with individuals, I am also anxious not only to set out the recommendation of counsel and my decision on it, but to outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  The legal advice of counsel contains in many cases comments relating to third parties, and clearly great care will have to be taken in setting out the main points made by counsel in a way which respects the rights of everyone concerned.<\/p>  <p>  This process will therefore have to be carefully and appropriately managed, so as to reflect the independence and objectivity which have been the hallmark of this process to date.<\/p>  <p>  I have therefore decided to appoint a former judicial figure to advise on the preparation of the letters.  I believe it is better to take that time now so as to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish.  I hope the House can accept that what I have decided about communicating decisions is the right course of action to take.<\/p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate to publish individual recommendations, I have considered how best information on the outcome of this process could be made public.  In this regard, I have asked counsel, in addition to making recommendations in individual cases, to produce a general overview of the issues and trends which featured in this process. I believe that this may lead to the identification of issues and recommendation for change across a number of areas, which I hope will enable us to address some of the general and thematic concerns raised by those persons whose cases were examined by counsel.  The report, when received, will be published by me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Debt Collection","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[20218\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her Department is planning to effect changes to the way debt is dealt with.","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>On 6 May 2015 the Government agreed to the drafting of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill.<\/p><p>The proposed Bill will implement a number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) in relation to the enforcement of debt.  The<b><i><\/i><\/b>LRC Report published in 2010 on <i>Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement<\/i>made a number of recommendations for wide scale reform of the existing personal insolvency and debt enforcement regimes.  Key elements of that Report in relation to insolvency and measures to assist in the resolution of personal indebtedness were implemented through enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.<\/p><p>The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill seeks to implement further recommendations of the Report aimed at enforcement and recovery of debts which could be developed to streamline the existing enforcement procedures which are available to creditors. There is a need for a balanced approach in relation to civil debt to ensure the protection of creditor rights by making available a range of legal mechanisms which compel payment by &ldquo;won&rsquo;t pay&rdquo; debtors who knowingly refuse to pay their obligations.<b><\/b>Creditors may apply to the Court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purpose of enforcement of debt.<\/p><p>Attachment of earnings would arise where a Court orders the debtor&rsquo;s employer to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s earnings to pay over to the creditor. Deduction from social welfare payments would arise where the Court orders the Department of Social Protection to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s Social Welfare payments to pay over to the creditor.  However, these provisions would be subject to a number of safeguards for debtors such as:-<\/p><p>- The provisions may only be used by a creditor after reasonable efforts to engage with the debtor have failed.  In applying to court for an attachment or deduction order, as the case may be, the onus is on the creditor to demonstrate to the court the efforts he or she has made to seek repayment.<\/p><p>- The debtor will be offered an opportunity to make representations to the court on his or her behalf before the court may make a decision on the matter.<\/p><p>- Importantly, in making a decision, the Court will be required to take into account the debtor&rsquo;s capacity to repay the debt in terms of the amount of the attachment or deduction which would be ordered.<\/p><p>- Provision is also made for variation or termination of the order if the debtor&rsquo;s circumstances change materially.<\/p><p>Of course the Government recognises that civil debts arise as a result of a range of different causes whether from financial borrowings or the supply of goods and services, including what might be regarded as essential services. The Government's intention is that this new legislation would not provide &quot;carte blanche&quot; as regards the use of the proposed attachment and deduction provisions in respect of all debts regardless of their source and amount. Methods of delimiting the application of the new measures having regard to both size of debt and the nature or source of the debt are being worked on actively, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, as part of the drafting process.<\/p><p>Importantly, the proposed Bill will also make provision for the abolition of imprisonment of debtors except in the case of maintenance arising from family law proceedings.  This implements one of the key recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this area.  Under existing law, arrest and imprisonment remains a possibility as an enforcement mechanism of last resort in cases where a creditor has proved beyond all reasonable doubt the judgment debtor has failed to comply with an instalment order due to his or her wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  This Bill removes this possibility for the vast majority of debtors.<\/p><p>Without doubt, the most desirable situation is for creditors and debtors to reach an amicable agreement for settlement of the debt.  However, the reality is that in some cases the debtor &ndash; who may actually be in a position to pay the debt -  simply refuses to engage with the creditor or does not adhere to the agreed repayment schedule to satisfy an outstanding debt.  It is an economic reality that creditors must have a  range of options available to them to recover money owed to them particularly where the debtor has capacity to repay and will not do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[19528\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill will be commenced; if this legislation will be enacted in its entirety; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>Following its passage by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signature by the President, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 has been enacted as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the new Act is a key element of the Government's programme of justice reform and it was commenced in its entirety on 27 April 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[20180\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to introduce the Judicial Council Bill; and if she will incorporate a version of the Sentencing Council, operational in England and Wales, in the Bill.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware from replies to previous PQs that the Programme for Government undertakes to &ldquo;<i>legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges&quot;.  <\/i>This commitment is being pursued by way of the proposed Judicial Council Bill which will provide for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board of that Council to promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges.

Most recently, on foot of a submission from the Innocence Project Ireland and the Justice for Harry Gleeson Group, the Attorney General directed that the case be reviewed by Mr. Shane Murphy SC.  Mr. Murphy concluded that, in his opinion, there were deficiencies in the conviction such as to render it unsafe. The Attorney concurred with this assessment, and advised that the deficiencies were such as to warrant the Government recommending to the President that he exercise his right of pardon.<\/p>  <p>  Mr Murphy detailed a number of factors which led to him forming his opinion, including the failure by the prosecution to introduce particular evidence, and these are set out in detail in the statement which I issued.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that I clarify that the examination carried out by Mr. Murphy was not intended to be an inquiry designed to establish all of the facts surrounding the conviction of Mr.Gleeson or indeed the murder of Ms. McCarthy.  The intention in carrying out the examination was focused on determining whether a case had been made for a pardon.  Accordingly, coming to a determination in relation to the motivation of any of the persons involved in the prosecution or investigation was not within the scope of the process, nor would such an exercise be warranted or feasible at this considerable remove.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated when I announced the Government's decision in relation to the Presidential pardon, it is a matter of the very greatest regret that a man was convicted and executed in these circumstances.

The Deputy will appreciate that, in the first instance, road traffic legislation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Insofar as current collaborative measures are concerned, the Deputy will be aware that Ireland has developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership.

As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, as the Act provides a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment. These changes will have significant implications for agencies across the Justice sector, including the Courts and the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service.<\/p>  <p>  The changes in processes and procedures which are required to implement the new system have to be carefully developed to ensure that the new system operates effectively and efficiently from the beginning.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.  The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation and the new procedures which will operate under it are as efficient as possible.<\/p>  <p>  There are major changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of payment by instalment will increase the overall workload of  processing fine payments. The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices. A procurement process is currently underway and contract negotiations with the preferred bidder are ongoing. The service provider will have to be in place before the new system can be fully implemented. The service provider's IT system will have to link in to the Courts Service IT system.<\/p>  <p>  Good progress in being made in the preparatory work. It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of this year. It is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated when publishing the Annual Report for 2014 of the Irish Prison Service on 18 May 2015, despite a small increase of 2.7% in the total committals to prison the overall daily average number of prisoners in custody has continued to fall. The overall daily average number of prisoners in custody in 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,158 in 2013, a decrease of 5.8%.<\/p>  <p>  There were 16,155 committals to prison in 2014 compared to 15,735 in 2013. The increase is attributed to an 8% increase in the numbers committed on sentences of less than 3 months specifically those committed for the non-payment of a court ordered fine. I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that on 19 May 2015 six persons or (0.2%) of the prison population of 3,739 were in custody for non-payment of a court ordered fine.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Fines (Payments and Recovery) Act is to eliminate, in so far as possible, the option of imprisonment as a sanction for fine default. Once the significant changes required to the fines system are implemented, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prison on short sentences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600053#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[19281\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has held meetings with the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice arising from the need for greater co-operation on combatting cross-Border criminal gangs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>I maintain regular contact with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to address matters of shared interest and to enhance cooperation on all policing and criminal justice matters on this island.  Cross border criminality is one of several issues which we discussed at our trilateral meeting in February which was also attended by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Michael Matheson.  The issue will be discussed again at the forthcoming North South Ministerial Council plenary meeting to be held in Dublin on 5 June next.  A key element of our discussions is to review the ongoing cooperation between an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as well as that between appropriate justice agencies in both jurisdictions - for example, the Revenue Commissioners and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  Minister Ford and I are very pleased with the the cooperation that currently exists but we are always open to explore how the relationships may be further enhanced.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; work closely with the PSNI and the UK National Crime Agency in combating the activities of organised crime gangs, with a particular focus on cross-border crime.  A key feature of the ongoing efforts to counteract cross-border crime is the inter-agency nature of the operational cooperation which involves the two police services and the two customs services on the island, and the Criminal Assets Bureau and the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency.  The two police services operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its objectives the  improvement of public safety throughout Ireland, the disruption of criminal activity and the enhancement of the policing capability of both police services on the island.  Both police services are jointly engaged in implementing a number of initiatives in all areas of policing in all these areas with a particular focus on areas close to the border.<\/p>  <p>  Law enforcement in relation to the smuggling of tobacco products, the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products within the State and fuel smuggling\/laundering is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  However, in targeting the illicit trade there is close cooperation between the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is also considerable cross border cooperation in tackling these illicit activities. The work of the Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling, which comprises representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs, the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau, has ensured that a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions, have been specifically targeted by the agencies involved.  A similar inter-agency group, the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group, is in place to support the fight against the activities of gangs engaged in tobacco smuggling.<\/p>  <p>  The success of this cooperation has been recognised by the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, who met to discuss the issue of cross border cooperation and illicit trade at their plenary session on 23 and 24 February last.  The Committee noted that cross border cooperation between justice and law enforcement officials and agencies is excellent and acknowledges those involved for their courage in tackling cross border crime and to make communities safer all across the island of Ireland.  I am currently considering the report and recommendations of the Committee and I will communicate my response to the Committee in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I would also say that the Garda authorities are keenly aware of the links that exist between paramilitary groups and organised criminal gangs, and factor this into their strategic approaches to combating these serious activities.  There remains a real and persistent threat from &lsquo;dissident&rsquo; paramilitary groups on this island and the Garda&iacute; and their counterparts are active in counteracting and disrupting their activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[19279\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has discussed the review arising from a case (details supplied) with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>My counterpart in Northern Ireland in respect of policing and justice matters is the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, David Ford.<\/p>  <p>  The review in question was commissioned by and submitted to the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions.

Niall Molloy.  The report was published with a number of redactions which were made following consultation with the Attorney General and in agreement with Mr. McGinn.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge, as I did when publishing the report, that first and foremost this case involves the tragic death of a man much loved by his family and by those in the community.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of concerns raised by the family of Fr Molloy, the SCRT carried out a major review of the case which involved an extensive examination of the original investigation, as well as detailed inquiries into the additional issues raised.  The SCRT report was submitted to the DPP who advised that there be no further prosecution in the case.<\/p>  <p>  While I, as Minister, have no role in the prosecution process I am of course very aware of the claims which have been made about Father Molloy&rsquo;s death over many years.  In an effort to address concerns about this matter, it was decided to appoint Mr. McGinn to independently assess what information could be put into the public domain in relation to the SCRT review of the case, and to advise as to whether further inquiry would be warranted.  This was an exceptional course of action, motivated by the desire to bring the greatest possible transparency to bear.<\/p>  <p>  The thrust of Mr. McGinn's report has been to shed light on as many issues as possible in order to minimise the number of unanswered questions regarding the case.  The report outlines how some of the concerns expressed about this case are simply not supported by evidence.  It also details shortcomings in the original investigation, which were identified by the SCRT Review.<\/p>  <p>  While unanswered questions do remain, the report concludes that the precise events surrounding Father Molloy&rsquo;s death cannot now be ascertained.  It concludes that, given the passage of time, the death of many of the pertinent witnesses, and the reluctance of others to give evidence, that it is unlikely any further inquiry would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth.  In these circumstances I have accepted the report's recommendation that examination by a further inquiry would not be warranted, and accordingly have no plans to commission a review along the lines referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is not the outcome that Fr Molloy's family have sought but I believe it is the only reasonable conclusion that can be reached following Mr McGinn's careful analysis of the SCRT review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[19512\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views that two Garda whistleblowers, who made serious allegations of Garda malpractice over a year ago, have not had investigations of their complaints completed, and that they have been placed in a very vulnerable position, vis a vis their peers; her plans regarding same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>By way of background, can I explain that, prior to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 coming into operation, whistleblowing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, which provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom Garda members, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The Confidential Recipient was required to transmit each confidential report to the Garda Commissioner.  Only where a confidential report contained an allegation which related to the Garda Commissioner was it transmitted to the Minister.  In transmitting a report, the Confidential Recipient was obliged to protect the identity of the whistleblower, and any communication between the Confidential Recipient and the whistleblower was confidential and was not conveyed to the Minister or Departmental officials.  The Regulations provided that any harassment or intimidation of a member who had made a confidential report would be dealt with in accordance with law and the relevant disciplinary regulations or disciplinary code.<\/p>  <p>  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of this Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistle blowers, including Garda whistleblowers.  GSOC was prescribed under the Act as a body to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may now communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer, or to GSOC as a prescribed body, and are entitled to the protections provided by the Act.  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place under the 2014 Act, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the two cases referred to by the Deputy, can I first of all make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  The Protected Disclosures Act rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the whistleblowing process, a confidentiality which is not easily reconciled with open discussions on the floor of this House.  However, I can say that I am advised by the Garda authorities that reports in both of the cases referred to by the Deputy were originally received under the Confidential Recipient regulations.  I understand that one of the cases is the subject of a comprehensive criminal investigation and upon completion may be the subject of a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I understand that the second case was subsequently referred to GSOC under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the Deputy will appreciate that I have no functions in relation to criminal investigations and the submission of files to the DPP, or in relation to the investigation of complaints by GSOC, and we must await the outcome of these investigations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[19371\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the discussions she has had with her European Union counterparts on migrant quotas for member states; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>The issue of what might be referred to as \"migrant quotas\" is currently arising in two contexts.

Cross border criminality is one of several issues which we discussed at our trilateral meeting in February which was also attended by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Michael Matheson.  The issue will be discussed again at the forthcoming North South Ministerial Council plenary meeting to be held in Dublin on 5 June next.  A key element of our discussions is to review the ongoing cooperation between an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as well as that between appropriate  justice agencies in both jurisdictions - for example, the Revenue Commissioners and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  Minister Ford and I are very pleased with the the cooperation that currently exists but we are always open to explore how the relationships may be further enhanced.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; work closely with the PSNI and the UK National Crime Agency in combating the activities of organised crime gangs, with a particular focus on cross-border crime.  A key feature of the ongoing efforts to counteract cross-border crime is the inter-agency nature of the operational cooperation which involves the two police services and the two customs services on the island, and the Criminal Assets Bureau and the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency.  The two police services operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its objectives the  improvement of public safety throughout Ireland, the disruption of criminal activity and the enhancement of the policing capability of both police services on the island.  Both police services are jointly engaged in implementing a number of initiatives in all areas of policing in all these areas with a particular focus on areas close to the border.<\/p>  <p>  Law enforcement in relation to the smuggling of tobacco products, the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products within the State and fuel smuggling\/laundering is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  However, in targeting the illicit trade there is close cooperation between the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is also considerable cross border cooperation in tackling these illicit activities. The work of the Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling, which comprises representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs, the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau, has ensured that a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions, have been specifically targeted by the agencies involved.  A similar inter-agency group, the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group, is in place to support the fight against the activities of gangs engaged in tobacco smuggling.<\/p>  <p>  The success of this cooperation has been recognised by the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, who met to discuss the issue of cross border cooperation and illicit trade at their plenary session on 23 and 24 February last.  The Committee noted that cross border cooperation between justice and law enforcement officials and agencies is excellent and acknowledges those involved for their courage in tackling cross border crime and to make communities safer all across the island of Ireland.  I am currently considering the report and recommendations of the Committee and I will communicate my response to the Committee in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  I would also say that the Garda authorities are keenly aware of the links that exist between paramilitary groups and organised criminal gangs, and factor this into their strategic approaches to combating these serious activities.  There remains a real and persistent threat from &lsquo;dissident&rsquo; paramilitary groups on this island and the Garda&iacute; and their counterparts are active in counteracting and disrupting their activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Remit","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[19527\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600054#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied with the capabilities and appropriateness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to act as a confidential recipient; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of this Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistle blowers, including Garda whistleblowers.

A detailed consideration of the matters raised, insofar as they relate to this State and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, had been carried out and was being finalised.

In these circumstances, it was considered appropriate and the safest course of action to postpone finalising consideration of the matters raised by the Omagh Group until the completion of the prosecution process in Northern Ireland.  This position has been communicated directly to the Omagh Group.<\/p>  <p>  In our shared desire for those who carried out the atrocity at Omagh to face justice I believe we must all seek to ensure we do not do or say anything that could in any way be interpreted to interfere with that process.

In doing so, officials in INIS maintain regular close contact with relevant Government Departments and agencies.  It is, however, important to emphasise, at the outset, that the vast majority of tourists visiting the State - over 96% - are from countries whose citizens do not require a visa to travel to the State e.g. the United Kingdom, other EU states, the United States, etc.<\/p>  <p>  In July, 2011, the Government launched the first ever Irish Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme.  Under this Programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa are able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Programme covers eighteen countries including major emerging tourism and business markets such as China and India.  The Programme has proven extremely successful leading to a 68% increase in visits from the countries covered by it from 2010 (the last full year before its introduction) and 2013.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the success of this programme, negotiations took place with the United Kingdom authorities on the development of a reciprocal programme i.e. of also allowing visitors with an Irish visa to travel to the UK on the basis of that visa.  These negotiations led to the establishment of the British Irish Visa Scheme which I launched, with the UK Home Secretary, in October last year.  This Scheme was implemented in China later that month and in India in February of this year.  The Scheme, which will supersede the Waiver Programme, allows visitors to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including the north and south of the island of Ireland, on a single visa.  A formal joint review of the Scheme with the UK is due to be carried out shortly and both Governments have committed to the worldwide rollout of the Scheme to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  I am confident that this Scheme will build on and expand the growth in visitor numbers resulting from the original Waiver Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, a liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other regular visitors with a good visa history, has been implemented in the Irish Visa Offices in Beijing, Moscow, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi over the last few years.  This regime allows for the issue of multi-entry visas for up to five years' duration for applicants with a good previous visa history.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing visa regime continues to support and facilitate tourism growth from countries whose citizens are visa-required for travel to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reserve","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[19375\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current strength of the Garda Reserve; her plans for the future of the Garda Reserve; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

Under the proposed Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill, creditors may apply to the court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purpose of enforcement of debts to which the legislation will apply.  Attachment of earnings would arise where a court orders the debtor&rsquo;s employer to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s earnings to pay over to the creditor.  Deduction from social welfare payments would arise where the court orders the Department of Social Protection to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s social welfare payments to pay over to the creditor.

My Department through the work of the Irish Youth Justice Service has committed to strengthening the evidence to support policies and services and to further develop targeted interventions to divert young people from the criminal justice system.  The set of actions by which we intend to do so, is detailed in Tackling Youth Crime, a Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018; which also forms part of &lsquo;Brighter Options, Better Futures&rsquo; the National Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020&rsquo;.  The focus is to continue the downward trends in high volume crime and reduce the necessity for detention through proven and innovative approaches to youth diversion.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has secured &euro;2.8 million under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan for Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are funded by the Community Programme Unit (CPU) of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS).  I was pleased to announce on 15 May last, the details of the first tranche of that funding, totalling &euro;1.37 million, which has been allocated for expenditure.  I have given my approval for 10 new GYDPs to open in areas which have not previously been served by a GYDP.  This will increase the total number of GYDPs in operation to 110.  In addition, the funding will be used to support the recruitment of additional staff to 16 existing Garda Youth Diversion Projects, in order to respond to higher levels of youth crime or to expand the geographical remit of the project.  Funding will also be provided for the expansion of an initiative in the Mid West area to engage with &ldquo;hard to reach&rdquo; young people involved in criminal activity.  The locations for the new GYDPs and additional staff in existing projects is available on both the Department of Justice and Equality and IYJS' websites.<\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased to have launched last week the first Divisional model of Garda Youth Diversion Project provision. Kerry Empowering Youth &ndash; KEY, a Kerry Garda Youth Justice Divisional Model is a new model of Garda Youth Diversion project delivery developed in partnership by Kerry Diocesan Youth Service (KDYS) and Kerry Garda Division, with support from the IYJS of my Department.  The new service delivery model has been very successful and has enabled KDYS in partnership with Kerry Divisional Garda&iacute; to reach over 100 additional young people so far who would not have otherwise received support from trained Youth Justice Workers.  The IYJS is currently rolling out an expansion of the Divisional Youth Diversion model in partnership with Garda&iacute; and Community Based Organisations in Cork City.<\/p>  <p>  From the start of this year, GYDPs and some Young Persons Probation (YPP) are being co-funded under the Programme for Employment, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) of the European Social Fund 2014-2020.  It is planned that a total of &euro;84 million will be expended over the course of the Programme.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no specific research linking the drop in youth crime to diversion projects, all stakeholders in the area, both statutory and non-statutory are extremely positive about their impact and success.  The Garda Youth Diversion Programme has made significant inroads in targeting supports to young people to effectively divert them towards more positive life choices.  I will shortly be publishing the 2013 Annual Report of the Committee to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Garda Diversion Programme which will show that the trend of falling numbers of young people coming to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and being referred to the Garda Diversion Programme is continuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Census of Population Data","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[20016\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC03000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the next collection of data for the census 2016 will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[20017\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600055#WRC03100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the reason the census does not ask if a person has deaf-blindness as a disability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 158 together.<\/p>  <p>  The census is a major undertaking for the Central Statistics Office.  The census will give a comprehensive picture of the social and living conditions of the country - information that only a census can provide in such complete geographical and fine grained detail. Similar to Census 2011 there will be detailed demographic results covering topics such as age profiles, employment, housing, families, migration, ethnicity, religion, health, education and commuting patterns.  Census Enumerators will call at every doorstep of every home in Ireland to deliver in the region of 1.8 million census forms.<\/p>  <p>  Given the recent budgetary environment that Ireland has experienced the Central Statistics Office conducted an extensive user consultation on the continuing need for a five-yearly census in Ireland.  The response to that consultation showed overwhelming support for a five-yearly census and the enormous value that the data brings, with particular emphasis on the value of small area data that only the census can provide.  The Government accordingly decided that a census will be undertaken in 2016.  Census day will be 24 April 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The expected cost of the 2016 Census is &euro;50 million, spread over the 3 years of  2015-2017; the field staff pay is the largest component at some &euro;26 million.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO will recruit over 5,180 temporary staff to conduct the field operation, made up of 50 senior managers, 430 field supervisors and some 4,700 enumerators.  The recruitment campaign began on 30 April with the advertisement of the 50 senior manager positions; interviews for these positions will take place in June and the first of these staff are due to take up duty on 28 September.  The recruitment of the 430 field supervisors, who will be employed for 6 months on the census, will begin in mid-September and they are due to be appointed in early January 2016.  Finally, the enumerators positions will be advertised at the end of December and they will be appointed for a 10 week period from mid-March until the end of May 2016.  Applications for all positions on the census are being accepted through an on-line application form on the CSO web site and are being advertised in advance through Intreo, on Publicjobs.ie and in the national press.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO works hard to ensure that the information collected and provided from the census remains current, relevant and of maximum use to the public.  It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings.  Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016.  Accordingly the 2016 census will be run as a &lsquo;no-change&rsquo; census with the questions on the 2016 questionnaire remaining unchanged from those used in the 2011 census, with the exception of the question on marital status.<\/p>  <p>  The format of the question on disability used in 2011, and being repeated in 2016, was agreed by the Census Advisory Group which was established to assist the CSO in developing the 2011 questionnaire.  This group comprised representatives of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data, along with the relevant CSO personnel.  The group reviewed over 90 submissions for new questions or changes to existing questions during the course of their work.  In addition a specific sub-group, comprised of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the  Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies was convened to consider the disability-related questions on the census form.  The current format of the disability question was tested successfully in the April 2009 Census Pilot Survey and the Government subsequently accepted the advice of the CSO and the Census Advisory Group to accept this format of the question.<\/p>  <p>  The exact format of the question is outlined below, and persons can choose multiple categories of disabilities.  As censuses of population are traditionally held at five-yearly intervals in Ireland it is intended that should there be a census in 2021 a full public consultation on the questions to be asked will be conducted in advance.<\/p>  <p>Q. 16.

The trustees are required to report the funding position of a scheme to the Pensions Authority on a regular basis.  If a scheme fails to meet the funding requirement, the trustees are required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Authority setting out how it is proposed to restore scheme funding.<\/p>  <p>  This funding requirement was suspended following the downturn in financial markets in 2008.  In the meantime, a number of both administrative and legislative measures were introduced to support employers and trustees of pension schemes in responding to the funding challenge.  Following a review of the defined benefit pension model, I introduced legislation in 2012 which required the trustees of pension schemes to maintain an additional level of funding in the form of a &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; to protect the pension entitlements of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  Pension schemes are required to have this level of funding in place by 2023.  Following this change to legislation in 2012, the funding requirements set out in the Pension Act were re-introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is working with the trustees of pension schemes to achieve sustainable pension provision.  At the end of 2014, 60% of defined benefit pension schemes were in compliance with the funding requirements set out in the Pensions Act.

The rates of carers allowance and carers benefit are among the higher rates of social welfare payments. The weekly payment rate for a person aged under 66, caring for 1 person is &euro;204, while the rate for a person aged over 66 is &euro;239.  An increase of 50% is paid where a carer is caring for more than one person (&euro;306 and &euro;358.50 for carers under and over 66 respectively).<\/p>  <p>  Total expenditure on carers (Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Respite Care Grant) has increased from just under &euro;752 million in 2010 to almost &euro;806 million in 2014. This is an increase of &euro;53.9 million or 7.2%.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of income support, the Department made a commitment in the NCS to organise an annual meeting where organisations representing carers would be afforded an opportunity to meet officials from the relevant Departments with responsibilities in this area and the HSE to discuss issues of concern. The most recent of these meetings was in February last, and the feedback from the carers&rsquo; organisations to this development is very positive. In addition to that annual meeting, I am pleased to say that the Department also meets regularly with the carers&rsquo; representative groups to discuss both policy and operational issues. Carers&rsquo; groups are also represented at the Department&rsquo;s annual pre-Budget forum. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the rate of respite care grant, I am aware that the reduction in the rate of the grant in 2013 was challenging for carers but in framing budgetary adjustments, the concern has been to protect primary social welfare rates, as indicated above, and any change to the rate of the grant can only be considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position.<\/p>  <p>  However, I would point out that the rate of &euro;1,375 is still more than twice what it was in 2002 (when it was &euro;635), and higher than it was in 2006 at the height of the economic boom, (when it was &euro;1,200).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600059#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600059#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[20422\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600059#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application\/appeal in respect of an invalidity pension by a person (details supplied) in County Carlow; if the appeal will be expedited; and if an oral hearing will be considered as the medical evidence states clearly that the applicant will not be able to work for the foreseeable future.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 21 May 2015.

It requires a number of public procurement exercises, one of which is underway at present.  Accordingly, the start-up costs to develop and set up the ICT solutions, and put in place comprehensive customer support services, will be incurred in 2015.  On the basis of the scoping work done to date, it is now estimated that these once-off costs, together with the operational costs for 2015, will amount in total to approx. &euro;6 million.

This includes regulations on lending, savings, investments and additional services.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to additional services CP88 indicated that the Central Bank is open to proposals from credit unions on new additional services they wish to provide to members where:<\/p>  <p>  - the proposed additional service is supported by a robust business case;<\/p>  <p>  - the proposed additional service is not contrary to financial services legislation;<\/p>  <p>  - the board of directors has a sound appreciation of the nature of the additional service proposed and is fully informed of the strategic, governance, risk management, operational, financial and legal implications involved; and<\/p>  <p>  - systems and controls are in place to ensure any risks involved in the provision of the additional service are managed and mitigated.<\/p>  <p>  Following the\u00a0introduction of the regulations, the Central Bank also indicated in CP88 that where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, the Central Bank will consider any amendments to the regulations that may be appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The consultation closed on 27 February 2015\u00a0 and a feedback statement and final regulations are planned to be published by end June 2015, following consideration of the submissions received.<\/p>  <p>  The credit union sector is currently being restructured on a voluntary,\u00a0incentivised and\u00a0time-bound\u00a0basis. The Central Bank is taking a proactive approach to facilitating restructuring and works closely with the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) and individual credit unions on restructuring proposals. The Central Bank supports restructuring proposals that are financially sound, supported by proper risk and control frameworks and have clear leadership and vision for the future direction of the merged credit union. The important objective is to ensure that restructuring achieves better outcomes for current and prospective members, enhances the financial soundness of credit unions and acts as an enabler for future growth and development, setting the sector up for a viable and successful future.<\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions has indicated that as part of the Central Bank's role to support the sustainable and prudent development of the credit union sector, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss areas of credit union business model development and anticipates that these dialogues will provide credit union stakeholders with a well\u00a0grounded basis to develop sound risk-based developments to their business models. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises\u00a0the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and while my role and the Central Bank's role in relation to the credit union sector\u00a0are\u00a0 distinct, we are both working to protect members' savings and maintain\u00a0the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600062#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[20151\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600062#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his Department's strategy for the credit union sector and where it fits within the overall financial landscape; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  <\/p><p>The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  <\/p><p>As I have previously stated, credit unions have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities throughout the country.

I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.  Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers.  In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks.  This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates.  The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments.  Officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks and a follow up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL01850"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[20311\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the threshold for liability for capital gains tax or capital acquisitions tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>In relation to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) the first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in any year are exempt from CGT.

The notional distribution arrangement only applies where the ARF owner is 60 years or over for the whole of a tax year.  The notional distribution was phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% from 2009. <\/p><p>The notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year.  Budget and Finance Act 2011 increased the rate of the notional distribution to 5% of the value of the assets of an ARF, while Finance Act 2012 further increased the rate to 6% in respect of ARFs with values over &euro;2 million.  In last year's Finance Act, however, I reduced the 5% rate to 4% for ARF owners \u00a0who are under the age of 70.  This reduction in the imputed distribution rate is intended to reduce the risk that individuals in the age group 60 to 70 years might outlive the funds in their ARFs.<\/p><p>An important point to note is that, while most ARF owners take actual draw downs at least equal to the notional distribution rate, there is no obligation on them to do so.  The requirement in the legislation is not a statutory minimum drawdown condition.  The only requirement is that tax is paid from the ARF on the notional drawdown amount, whether\u00a0it is drawn down or not. <\/p><p>I do not accept the suggestion in the details supplied with this question that the tax on the notional\u00a0distribution is a tax on capital gains.  We operate what is known as an EET system of pension taxation, whereby contributions to pension arrangements and the build up of the pension assets in the pension fund are both \u00a0tax-exempt, while pensions are taxed as income in the pay-out phase. \u00a0ARFs, although they are post-retirement investment vehicles and not pension funds <i>per se<\/i>, none the less \u00a0benefit from\u00a0gross roll-up, which effectively extends the tax exempt fund phase and it is only right that \u00a0this deferred taxation is &quot;collected&quot; at the point when the ARF owner accesses his or her funds.  As already mentioned the imputed distribution regime was introduced to encourage ARFs to be used as intended, that is, to provide an ongoing income stream in retirement as a flexible alternative to annuities. \u00a0<\/p><p>I have no plans at this time to further amend the imputed distribution arrangements for ARFs but will bear concerns such as those of the Deputy's correspondent in mind when considering the matter in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL02650"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[20389\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 282 of 12 May 2015, his further views on tax on rental income (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>As I advised the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 282 of 12 May 2015, the extent to which expenses incurred in earning rental income are deductible in computing taxable rents is specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.<\/p><p>This question relates, <i>inter alia<\/i>, to the restriction on the deductibility of interest and the non-deductibility of local property tax (LPT) in computing taxable income from residential property.  In the case of interest accruing on or after 7 April 2009 (in so far as it would otherwise be allowable) the deduction available to the landlord is limited to 75% of such interest.  A deduction is not allowed in respect of LPT as it is not one of the specified deductions provided for in section 97(2) of the TCA.<\/p><p>The Deputy suggests that the restriction, or non-deductibility, of both interest and LPT can result in taxable rental profits arising in situations where a comparison of rents and all rent-related expenditure can result in an apparent loss.  This conclusion appears to be based on an assumption that in the case of income from investment assets (expected to produce income and capital gains) the taxable amount should inherently be computed after allowing a deduction for all costs incurred in earning that income.  However, there is no such general principle in the tax code, and there are many examples of situations where interest deductibility is not allowed in the context of investment assets.  For example, the funding costs of quoted shares are not generally deductible against dividend income from those shares.  The Deputy should also note that while the deductions specified in section 97(2) have generally included interest on borrowed money to purchase, improve or repair the rented premises, that entitlement has been removed or restricted on a number of occasions.  An example was the interest restriction imposed between 1998 and 2002 in respect of certain rented residential property borrowings (following the Bacon reports). <\/p><p>I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is an annual self-assessed tax on residential properties in the State and is administered by them in accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) 2012.  LPT is not a rate levied by a local authority and is, therefore, not deductible from gross rents under section 97(2) of the TCA.  As a consequence of the abolition of local authority rates on domestic property in the late 1970s the reference to &quot;any rate levied by a local authority&quot; in section 97(2) of the TCA is now only relevant to commercial property.\u00a0 <\/p><p>On the question of whether LPT should be a deductible expense in calculating a landlord's taxable rental income, as I have stated in response to previous Parliamentary Questions on the matter, this was considered in the Thornhill Report, which recommended that LPT should be deductible.  The report, however, recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, and, for this reason, suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years.  The report also considered that it was for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the timespan for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.  The Government has agreed in principle to accept this recommendation but has not, as yet, decided on the manner in which this will happen or its timing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL02850"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[20440\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600063#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of all official foreign trips he and Ministers of State in his Department plan to take between now and the end of 2015;

","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>Firstly, I wish to clarify for the Deputy that projections of the structural balance set out in the 2015 Stability Programme Update (SPU)\u00a0are not\u00a0estimated\u00a0using either the reference rate or convergence margin.  Rather, the structural balance is calculated using a measure of the output gap (based on potential GDP growth) which\u00a0is set out in Table 15 of the SPU. <\/p>  <p>  In contrast, the\u00a0two concepts referred to by the\u00a0Deputy - the reference rate and the convergence margin - are used to determine permitted expenditure growth under the other metric used to assess compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability\u00a0and Growth Pact\u00a0- the expenditure benchmark.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 SPU set out an illustrative, ex ante application of the expenditure benchmark for 2016 on the basis of a reference rate of 1.9 per cent.  This is based on the latest European Commission estimates of Ireland's potential GDP growth rate over the years 2010 to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In light of major issues raised by myself at the March ECOFIN meeting\u00a0and followed up\u00a0at\u00a0a technical level by\u00a0officials in my Department,\u00a0the Commission\u00a0has amended the way the 10-year average potential growth rate is calculated\u00a0for all Member States.  The 10-year average reference rate is now calculated annually rather than every three years.\u00a0 This will allow greater levels of expenditure consistent with the expenditure benchmark\u00a0for Ireland\u00a0than was previously the case when reference rates were set for a three-year period.  This is because with an annual update in the rate,\u00a0the impact of the weak potential GDP growth rates evidenced during the crisis drop out\u00a0earlier than would previously have been\u00a0the case and this is a more realistic approach.<\/p>  <p>  On a purely technical basis,\u00a0the reference rate consistent with the European Commission's Spring 2015 forecasts for Ireland's potential GDP growth would rise to 2.2 per cent in 2017\u00a0increasing steadily up to 2.7 per cent\u00a0in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The convergence margin used in the illustrative application for 2016 in the SPU is 1.8 per cent.  The European Commission, in its assessment of compliance with the expenditure benchmark, will also now update the convergence margin on an annual basis.  However, as the Commission does not publish projected primary expenditure ratios beyond 2016, it is not possible at this point to derive a consistent estimate of the convergence margin for the years\u00a0out to 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600064#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600064#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[20648\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600064#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated nominal non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment and the percentage non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment of the labour force used in the 2015 stability programme update.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>The non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment or NAWRU is the concept of structural unemployment used within the\u00a0harmonised framework for estimating potential output used by the European Commission.

The threshold was initially set at &euro;5 million, which was subsequently reduced to &euro;2.3 million and further reduced in the 2013 Finance Act to &euro;2 million.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to them by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  There is, therefore, no underlying data readily available to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings that would arise specifically from a reduction to the SFT from &euro;2 million to &euro;622,500 as requested by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the cap on the annual earnings limit for determining maximum allowable pension contributions for pension purposes, based on the latest information available, reducing the &euro;115,000 ceiling to &euro;75,000 per annum is tentatively estimated to yield in the region of &euro;100 million.<\/p>  <p>  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 (the current life-time limit on tax-free retirement lump sums) to be returned to the Revenue Commissioners, I am advised that they are not in a position to provide definitive figures demonstrating estimated savings to the Exchequer on the impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount to &euro;122,500.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the final question, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated yield if the discretionary non-pension deductions and reliefs, which are currently allowable for tax at an individual's marginal rate of income tax, were confined to the standard rate would be in the order of &euro;480 million.<\/p>  <p>  These estimates, for all Questions, are based on data for 2012, the latest year for which returns have been filed and fully processed.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that these various estimates take no account of the behavioural impact which the suggested changes would be bound to have either individually or collectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600064#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600064#WRM01925"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[20738\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600064#WRM02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated return to the Exchequer from introducing a tax on online gambling of 5%, in view of the changes brought into force by the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":571,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[20739\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600064#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated return to the Exchequer from introducing a tax on online gambling of 15% in view of the changes from the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":572,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 311 and 312 together.<\/p>  <p>  Following commencement of the licensing provisions for remote operators, provided for in the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015, provisions for the extension of duty to remote bookmakers and remote betting intermediaries were commenced on 15 April.

The OGP's mission is to deliver sustainable procurement savings for the tax payer by optimising value for money across the public service. <\/p><p>The model for public service procurement being implemented by the OGP and its sourcing partners in Health, Local Government, Education and Defence is based upon the &quot;lead buyer&quot; principle from professional procurement, whereby the main customer of a category of goods or services sources in the market on behalf of all customers.  16 major categories of expenditure have been identified that make up over 95% of Public Sector procurement spend (excluding Construction) in Ireland. Construction spend is currently out of scope for OGP operations, but the Office covers the policy aspects.\u00a0 The categories are listed below. <\/p><p>1. Professional Services\u00a0 <\/p><p>2.

Defence<\/p><p>The first eight categories in this list (1-8) are common, that is categories of goods or services required by all PSBs.\u00a0 Most of the goods and services contracts that fall into these categories are increasingly procured by the OGP on behalf of all PSBs via national, regional or sectoral frameworks.\u00a0 The next two categories, namely Plant Hire and Minor Works &amp;amp; Civil's (9 &amp;amp; 10), are primarily purchased by Local Authorities, so the sourcing of these are now led by the Local Government Operational Procurement Centre (LGOPC) hosted by Kerry County Council. <\/p><p>The next three medical categories on the list (11-13) are led by the HSE, Lab Diagnostics and Library and Farming (14 &amp;amp; 15) are led by the Education Procurement Service and\u00a0Defence (16) will be led by the Department of Defence. <\/p><p>The transition to this new model has commenced.\u00a0 The OGP is increasingly delivering contractual arrangements for common goods and services on behalf of Local Government which, in turn, is delivering contractual arrangements on minor works, civil's and plant hire on behalf of other public bodies, such as HSE, Education, etc. <\/p><p>The frameworks the OGP is putting in place typically breakdown customer requirements by lots against which suppliers can bid.\u00a0 This is required by Circular 10\/14 which sets out measures that will be taken by all public bodies to facilitate SMEs in bidding for Government contracts.  Lots may be based on goods or services descriptions, usage patterns, size and nature of customer demand and\/or geographical location.\u00a0 The lotting arrangements will be determined by the sourcing strategy and consider customer requirements and market supply factors.\u00a0 Many services require local delivery and the reformed model will meet those needs. <\/p><p>Transition to the new model is under way and customer requirements are still being gathered.\u00a0\u00a0A timeframe for completion of the transition will be established when the full workload has been gathered and assessed, and the delivery model gains more experience in operation at scale.\u00a0 There is no breakdown at a county by county of the work transitioning in the model, however data from 2012 for Local Government indicated an expenditure on all goods and services of &euro;1,080 million.\u00a0 Expenditure now in Irish Water is included in the figures.\u00a0 The estimated expenditure on Local Government led categories for 2014 was &euro;805 million under the reformed model, excluding expenditure now in Irish Water. <\/p><p>The reform of public procurement in Ireland is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery. \u00a0The recently published report by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) &quot;Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013&quot; indicates that 93% of public service procurement expenditure was with businesses in the Republic of Ireland and that 66% was with SMEs.

This reform enables public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they must now operate.  The Government acknowledges, however, the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this regard my Department issued Circular 10\/14 in 2014\u00a0aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with public procurement is easy and low cost.  This guidance set out positive measures that contracting authorities should take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises and highlights practices that are to be avoided which may hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.<\/p>  <p>  The main thrust of the circular is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs, etc.<\/p>  <p>  - the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 to be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders;<\/p>  <p>  - it encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities;<\/p>  <p>  - buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and\u00a0the circular puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers where possible;<\/p>  <p>  - it promotes greater use of \"open\" tendering and less use of \"restrictive\" tendering;<\/p>  <p>  -it\u00a0encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition; and,<\/p>  <p>  - it encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so and where it does\u00a0not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which falls under the remit of my Department, works\u00a0with\u00a0the various industry representative bodies (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) to promote the\u00a0engagement of Irish business in public procurement as well as with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland.  Last year, for example, the OGP supported two \"Meet the Buyer\" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by\u00a0over 1,100 suppliers.  The OGP\u00a0also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.  This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SME's to jointly bid for state contracts.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to SME participation in public procurement, recent analysis carried out by the OGP indicates that 93% of government procurement expenditure falls within the State and that 66% of this is directly with Irish SMEs. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers and business representatives on behalf of Government to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that public procurement policies are business friendly.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600065#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[20067\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600065#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of small and medium sized enterprises that applied for Government procurement contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[20068\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600065#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of small and medium sized enterprises that were successful in their applications for Government procurement contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325 and 326 together.<\/p><p>It\u00a0is the responsibility of individual contracting authorities to publish tender notices and contract award notices.  In 2013, public service and semi-state bodies published 5,826 tender notices.  This process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal .  This portal\u00a0is the Irish Government's public platform for advertising public sector procurement tenders.  Contracting authorities can use this portal to receive\u00a0responses electronically from suppliers.  However, a large proportion of tender responses are submitted in\u00a0hard copy and it is not possible to accurately report on the number of bids for all tender notices published.  Responses in hardcopy are requested where exhibits and sample material is required by contracting authorities for evaluation purposes.<\/p><p>The eTenders system is also used to automatically send out e-notifications of tender notices published on the system to registered suppliers who have expressed an interest in the particular type of goods, services or works required in the tender notice.  This is driven using the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) codes of the European Commission.  The system also incorporates a Supplier Register that holds company information as entered by each supplier.  Historically many suppliers have registered their company multiple times and often provided incorrect business profiles.  While significant progress was made during 2014 in cleaning up supplier data on the etenders system, the work is still on-going and there is insufficient current information available to report on tendering activity by supplier classification such as small and medium sized enterprises. <\/p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP), which commenced sourcing operations in 2014, has a clear remit to deliver sustainable savings for the taxpayer through centralising procurement across the public service and encouraging SMEs to fully engage in public procurement.  In this context, the OGP chairs an SME stakeholder group which includes representatives from a range of groups and organisations that represent SMEs in Ireland.  The Office is working with these government agencies and industry representative bodies in developing and implementing policy initiatives, and in driving supplier education and awareness. <\/p><p>The OGP published a Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis report in March 2015.  This report as the first of its kind for the public service,\u00a0analysed &euro;2.742 billion of non-pay expenditure data from the Health, Justice, Local Government and Education sectors for 2013 representing a significant portion of overall procurement expenditure for that year.  For the first time, we have a view as to how and with whom that money was spent and the analysis is very encouraging.  The data analysed indicates that 93% of the State s invoiced expenditure is with firms within the State and that 66% of the State s expenditure is with SMEs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600065#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":617,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 327 and 328 answered with Question No. 324.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drainage Schemes","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600065#WRN03000"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[20127\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600065#WRN03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when approval will be provided to a drainage scheme on the Clare River in County Galway, in view of the reply provided to a Parliamentary Question by this Deputy on 30 April 2015, where it stated that a decision was expected to be made on the scheme in the coming weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>As indicated in my replies to previous Questions on this subject, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has submitted the proposals for the Clare River (Claregalway) scheme for statutory approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts. <\/p><p>A report commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a required independent evaluation of the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the Scheme by the OPW is under consideration by that Department.

The directives contain measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups.<\/p>  <p>  These include:<\/p>  <p>  - except in justified cases, turnover requirements will be explicitly limited to two times the estimated contract value.<\/p>  <p>  - acceptance of self-declarations for evaluating the capacity and capability until the award stage<\/p>  <p>  - the promotion of e-procurement with mandatory electronic availability of procurement documents;<\/p>  <p>  - contracting authorities to comply or explain in relation to the division of contracts into lots;<\/p>  <p>  - Member States to provide the Commission with detail on SME participation. (Such monitoring can support consistent application across all Member States and ensure that the objective of greater SME involvement is being delivered.)<\/p>  <p>  I would also point out that the\u00a0Office of Government\u00a0Procurement (OGP), which falls under the remit of my Department, has accelerated some of these key measures in\u00a0Circular 10\/14 which issued in April 2014 including the requirements to tender in an open and transparent process on-line, reductions in bidder's turnover requirements, proportional and reasonable insurance requirements, and breaking larger contracts down into lots.<\/p>  <p>  In addition the OGP\u00a0is working\u00a0with\u00a0industry representative bodies to promote the\u00a0engagement of Irish business in public procurement (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland.  Last year, for example, the OGP supported two \"Meet the Buyer\" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by\u00a0over 1,100 suppliers.  The OGP\u00a0also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SMEs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work on behalf of Government with industry to ensure that winning\u00a0public procurement contracts\u00a0is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600066#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600066#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[20445\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600066#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide details of all official foreign trips he and Ministers of State in his Department plan to take between now and the end of 2015; if he will provide details of whom he and the Ministers of State in his Department will be meeting on these trips; the purpose of these trips; the duration of these trips; his plans to use all of these trips to promote Ireland as a good place for doing business and as a destination for foreign direct investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question the following tables provide details of all the official trips that I and the Minister for State Simon Harris T.D., intend to take between now and the end of the year.<\/p><p>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Brendan Howlin T.D.<table><tr><th>Date<\/th><th>Details of people the Minister will be meeting<\/th><th>Purpose<\/th><th>Duration<\/th><th>Plans to promote Ireland as a good place for doing business and as destination for foreign direct investment<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>June 2015<\/td><td>Latvia Presidency of the Council of Ministers.\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>Meeting with Regional Policy Commissioner Corina Cretu.<\/td><td>Informal meeting of Ministers responsible for EU cohesion policy.

Among other provisions, the Scheme provides that contracts for the supply of a gift card or voucher must not include a term that makes the card or voucher subject to an expiry date.  While this and other provisions of the Scheme are only proposals at this stage, I am conscious of the consumer detriment that can result from the application of expiry dates to gift cards.  I will, however, consider carefully all responses to the consultation, including proposals for additional protections for consumers in respect of gift cards and vouchers, before finalising legislative proposals for submission to Government.<\/p>  <p>  The current terms and conditions of the particular gift card product referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question suggest that this card no longer includes an expiry date but remains valid as long as there is a balance on the card.  A monthly inactive balance charge applies, however, from twelve months after the issue of the card.  The Scheme of the proposed Bill provides that this charge should be assessable for fairness under the provisions on unfair terms in consumer contracts and must be disclosed to the consumer before he or she is bound by the gift voucher contract. <\/p>  <p>  Gift card products of the kind referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 (S.I.

All will include specific actions for all the enterprise development organisations and other public bodies active in each region, to promote enterprise growth and job creation.  Of course specific issues and factors relevant to particular regions will be fully embraced in the new Strategies.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s Business and Technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations including Sligo in the North West.  The design and planning process has commenced and full planning permission should be received in the second half of 2015 with construction on site to commence after this and the procurement stages.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its property programme, IDA Ireland has committed to investing in new property solutions.  Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar are to the forefront of the 2015 investment programme with other locations scheduled to follow in subsequent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600067#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":700,"content":"<p>Question No. 356 answered with Question No. 354.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Sector Strategy","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600067#WRP01075"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[20722\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600067#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding recent graduates in the quantity surveying sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>Securing employment opportunities for those with appropriate skills is a key priority of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs, including for those interested in career in the construction sector. In May 2014 the Government published &lsquo;<i>Construction 2020 &ndash; a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector<\/i>&rsquo; to help deliver a competitive, innovative, dynamic, safe and sustainable construction sector, that can make its proper contribution to the economy and to job creation, that is based on best practice, and that is capable of delivering the economic and social infrastructure we need for the future. <\/p><p>Construction 2020 commits the Government to a detailed set of actions to identify and remove unnecessary blockages to appropriate, high quality development, while ensuring that future growth and activity is sustainable, and underpinned by proper data and analysis. It reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to moving the country away from cycles of boom and bust.<\/p><p>Construction 2020 contains a detailed programme of work, including 75 time-bound actions across a range of issues including ensuring a highly skilled workforce and ensuring opportunities for construction jobseekers. Progress is being made on securing new employment opportunities for those with the skills and interested in making a career in the construction sector. The most recent data from the CSO indicates an increase in employment of 19,600 over the year to the end of the first quarter of 2015. We are working hard to ensure that there are continued opportunities for those with the skills needed to underpin our economic recovery and of the construction sector. Similarly, the most recent Construction Purchasing Managers Index for April 2015 prepared by Ulster Bank indicates a jump in confidence in the sector, with a reading of 57.2, where a figure above 50 indicates growth. <\/p><p>Since publication, our commitment to delivery has been further underpinned by the appointment last July of Minister of State Paudie Coffey, with responsibility for coordinating and driving the important work forward. We have also established a dedicated Cabinet Committee to ensure that focus is maintained at the highest level of Government. <\/p><p>A number of significant milestones have been achieved, and we are seeing welcome and positive signs of recovery in the sector. <\/p><p>In the specific occupation of quantity surveying, it is estimated that there were 3,200 quantity surveyors in employment in Ireland in Quarter 4 2014.  There have been signs of employment growth in this occupation since the previous year although the overall size of this occupation is relatively small.  Quantity surveyors have appeared in vacancy data showing signs of demand.  Recruitment Agencies have reported some vacancies for quantity surveyors that are difficult to fill but these have been limited to specialised areas and candidates with considerable experience (e.g. at least 5 years) were required.  <\/p><p>The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland published <i>Employment Opportunities and Skills Requirements for Property and Construction Surveying 2014-2018<\/i>and<i><\/i>indicated that the most realistic scenario regarding expected growth opportunities for quantity surveyors over the four year period to 2018 is 506 across all levels of experience of which 207 would be at the graduate level.<\/p><p>A key aspect of Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2015 is the National Talent Drive Disruptive Reform.  Central to this is strengthening employability of learners and enhancing employer engagement at all levels of education and training. One of the Reform's four stated objectives is to spur a step change in the level of engagement between the education and training system and employers to deliver on skills needed to build the New Economy. Critical to the success of this Disruptive Reform will be active and sustained engagement, and the development of strong partnerships, between the education and training system and employers at a national and regional level.  Clear arrangements to connect employers, enterprise development agencies and the education and training system are crucial to strengthening engagement in areas such as: employer input to the development of education and training provision, creating sufficient and sustainable work placement opportunities, including undergraduate internships\/work experience to enhance the employability skills of learners and the development of apprenticeships in new economic sectors. Actions 1 to 24 in APJ2015 are directly aimed at achieving this necessary step change.<\/p><p>Programmes such as Springboard and JobBridge are aimed at enhancing the skills of jobseekers and progressing learners to employment in areas where future demand is expected to increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600067#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Microfinance Ireland","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600067#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[20753\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600067#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total amount of moneys lent by Microfinance Ireland in each year since its inception to the end of April 2014; the number of jobs sustained by this investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>As of 15 May 2015 Microfinance Ireland (MFI) has approved 565 applications to the value of &euro;8.6m supporting 1,246 jobs.

This event was attended by approximately 150 stakeholders from across the region, the majority of whom were from the private sector.  The objective of the Forum was to identify potential actions for inclusion in the Action Plan for Jobs for the West.  The process produced many ideas for consideration and my officials are currently working through the proposals to determine which of them can be implemented.<\/p><p>A Regional Project Delivery Team, comprising public bodies from the region, has also been established to assist in the development of the Action Plan and has met three times to date, once each in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon.<\/p><p>My objective is that six Regional Action Plans, including one for the West region, will be launched by July.  <\/p><p>The Government has committed up to &euro;250 million in funding over the next five years to support the Regional Action Plans.  &euro;150 million of this funding will support an IDA property programme, while up to &euro;100 million will be made available through Enterprise Ireland for three separate competitive calls which will support innovative and collaborative approaches to job creation across the regions.  The first two of these calls were launched on 15 May, with a closing date of 10 July 2015.

The BDGP has been approved under the agri-environment provisions in the RDP regulations and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd. The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers . Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.<\/p><p>The six year timeframe provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme. It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases. In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty however, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure <\/i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd. <\/p>  <p>  One of the requirements of the programme stipulates that from 30 June 2016, at least 80% of the AI used on participating holdings must be from 4 or 5 star bulls on either the terminal or replacement index. This complements the requirement that where a stock bull is used, at least one stock bull on the holding on the 30 June 2019 must be a genotyped 4 or 5 star bull on either the terminal or replacement index. <\/p>  <p>  There is a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. For example, ICBF recently completed its listing of recommended sires for bull breeders involved in the Gene Ireland maternal beef breeding program. In total there are some 164 bulls in that catalogue of which 151 (92%) are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index within or across breeds.   <\/p>  <p>  For imported bulls, the ICBF assigns a rating based on the data available for each bull at that time. The approach used to assigning this rating is in line with that used for all other bulls under the eurostar rating system. It would not be appropriate to assign higher ratings to imported bulls without any scientific rationale for doing so. It is important that any rating is based on objective, scientific criteria which the ICBF can justify to each and every farmer using such bulls. <\/p>  <p>  The fact that 20% of the AI used can come from other types of bulls gives scope for pedigree breeders that wish to use some outcross sires as part of the scheme. ICBF calculates a euro star evaluation for imported sires based on their foreign data so that they can be utilised under the programme. For example, there were 166 new beef AI sires coded last year, both Irish and internationally bred, and of these 69% are already compliant with the scheme. Indeed, ICBF can provide an indication of the likely euro star rating to be given to such bulls when imported into Ireland and it is likely that AI companies and breeders will be much more vigilant regarding the type of &ldquo;outcross&rdquo; bulls that they purchase\/import in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600068#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Fleet Modernisation","counter":754,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600068#WRQ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[19948\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600068#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to introduce a decommissioning scheme in the fishing industry, in any or all sectors; the way these schemes will be advertised; the selection process and grounds to be included in any such scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":756,"content":"<p>Under article 22 of the Common Fisheries Policy Regulation (1380\/2013), Member States are required to prepare each year a Fleet Report examining the balance between fishing capacity in each fleet segment and corresponding fishing opportunities, with a view to identifying structural over-capacity in any fleet segment.

As the person named received Grassland Sheep payments in the reference years, he is eligible for an allocation of payment entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. He is eligible for an allocation of 26.99 new BPS entitlements with an initial unit value of &euro;28.35 each. When the Greening Payment is added, his total payment for 2015 would be approximately &euro;1,114.45. Under the convergence process, this payment would increase to approximately &euro;4,000 by 2019. <\/p>  <p>  A Provisional Statement issued to the person named in February 2015 advising him of the number and value of his entitlements under the new scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600068#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600068#WRQ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[20095\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600068#WRQ02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment under the agri-environment options scheme will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri Environment Options Scheme (AEOS 2) with effect from 1 September 2011.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  It is a unique opportunity for farm participants to improve the efficiency and profitability of their herds, with significant state support.<\/p><p>It can also make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd and has been approved as an agri-environment measure under the Rural Development Programme.  The six-year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers.  Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.<\/p><p>The six-year timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers, allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme.  It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases.  In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty.  However, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach proposed reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations.  The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme.  As always in such cases, <i>force majeure <\/i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease.  There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.<\/p><p>Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.  The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing and this genotyping cost will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment.  The cost of the genotyping will be finalised following the conclusion of a public tendering process undertaken by the ICBF in relation to laboratory analysis, tissue tags and the DNA chip.  It is expected that this will result in a reduced sampling\/genotype cost compared to the 2014 scheme.<\/p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his\/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo;.  The number of &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo; will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme.  For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype 9 cows\/heifers\/calves\/stock bulls in each year of the programme without repetition.  In specific circumstances, 2015 may be used as the base year.<\/p><p>While the level of testing required has increased compared to the 2014 pilot scheme, the payment to the farmer has also increased significantly so the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes.  The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP.<\/p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified.  The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development.  This increased level of genotyping also adds value to the breeding indexes.<\/p><p>The BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose.  The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review.  If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission.  For now I am satisfied that the scheme provides the long-term support that is required to ensure the future sustainability of our suckler herd, within the parameters laid down by the relevant regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600069#WRR03400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Applications","counter":815,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600069#WRR03500"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[20185\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600069#WRR03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a reply will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Donegal in relation to a payment under the Single Payment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p>The person named submitted an application under 2013 Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Schemes on 1 May 2013.<\/p>  <p>  A land parcel of 7.42 hectares was omitted from the initial application.

EU Regulation 1380\/2013 sets down Ireland&rsquo;s Fishing Capacity ceiling from 1 January 2014.  This ceiling is expressed in terms of gross tonnes (GT) and engine power (kilowatts &ndash; kW) and covers the total fishing capacity of fishing vessels flying Ireland&rsquo;s flag.  Each Member State must manage entries into its fleet and exits from its fleet in such a way that the entry of new capacity into the fleet is compensated by the previous withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity.  This is known as the &ldquo;entry\/exit regime&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister I have responsibility for policy in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing under Section 3(3) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by Section 99 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded from getting\u00a0involved in individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned under Section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish fishing fleet is divided into five segments in accordance with Ministerial Policy Directive 2 of 2003, as amended.  The segments are as follows: Refrigerated Seawater (RSW) Pelagic Segment; Polyvalent Segment; Beam Trawler Segment: Specific Segment:Aquaculture Segment.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the policy sets out a number of sub-segments of the fleet including a sub-segment for vessels exclusively using pots, vessels targeting scallops and polyvalent vessels under 18 m in length.  The transfer of capacity between the segments and sub-segments is not permitted, and equivalent &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; capacity must be taken out of the segment or sub-segment into which a vessel is being introduced.  In order for vessels to qualify for either a mackerel and\/or herring Authorisation, vessels must be licensed with 100% capacity having the required track record as stipulated under the individual mackerel and herring fleet policies. <\/p>  <p>  Please note that fishing capacity is privately owned and is traded commercially, bought and sold independently of the Department and the Licensing Authority.  The request for a change in licensing policy involving the removal or amalgamation of segments or sub-segments would have a substantial impact on the Irish fishing fleet.  The current fleet policy allows operators to introduce new or replacement vessels and to modify existing vessels subject to the operator providing replacement capacity from the relevant segment and sub-segment.  The current policy has been put in place over many years and a change, as requested, would impact many elements of the fishing fleet.  It could potentially have significant impacts on access to fishing resources and the management of quotas.  I do not want to create an expectation we can go down the road of &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo;, which is what was available based on the application of very strict criteria, in the past, because &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo; is specifically not provided for in the new Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p>  <p>  There are many diverse views within the fishing industry and these often conflict.  It is important for the further development of the industry that views on any changes to be made are debated widely internally in the industry and that there is the maximum possible level of agreement and support within the industry for any proposed changes being sought by the industry.  Where the industry, preferably through the recognised representative structure of Producer Organisations, makes a business case for changes to the licensing policy on the basis of changed circumstance, I would examine any such case.  I would encourage the group of vessel owners who are calling for this major change to long-standing policy to engage widely with the Producer Organisations so that any proposed changes can be brought forward with widespread support from across the industry.  The changes being proposed would significantly impact many operators in the industry.  Any amendments to licensing policy that I might bring forward will be subject to a public consultation with stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600070#WRS02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600070#WRS02400"},{"type":"question","counter":855,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[20376\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600070#WRS02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a farmer (details supplied) has not received payment for 2014 under the single payment scheme; if his Department has accepted the procedures followed by the applicant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":856,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2014 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Scheme application on 16 March 2014.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.<\/p><p>The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP over and above existing schemes for the suckler beef sector.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins.  This scheme is putting &euro;300 million into accelerating genetic improvement and so the requirement for farmers to move towards using 4- and 5-star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to its objectives.  I am fully aware that these requirements will take time which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time.<\/p><p>If this is to be successful, it is vital that farmers are aware of the ratings of the animals currently on their farms and the ratings of the animals they may be purchasing.  Farmers will be informed of the details of animals on their farms with eurostar ratings shortly after applying for the scheme.  Scheme applicants will then be able to use this information, together with other details provided to them with regarding their number of eligible animals and eligible hectares, to make a final assessment of their commitment to the scheme.  There will then be a period of time available to farmers to withdraw from the scheme, without penalty or obligation, should they feel that the scheme is not suitable to their farm enterprises.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department is also exploring means of making information on eurostar ratings widely available and I will be advising livestock marts to play their part in this regard.  I am confident that the provision of this information, together with the advice and guidance which scheme applicants will receive on an ongoing basis, will ensure that applicants are in position to meet all of the scheme requirements which are carefully phased-in over a number of years.<\/p><p>The BDGP is an area based payment whereby the number of calved cows on the holding in 2014 is divided by a standard stocking density of 1.5 calved cows\/hectare in order to establish the number of eligible hectares for payment.  In line with the requirements of the European Commission, the number of eligible hectares declared each year cannot reduce by more than 20% during the course of the programme.  If a farmer knows in advance that some land rented to him will not be available from a point in time, then he\/she should make every effort to ensure that he\/she has sufficient land available.  This is a mandatory scheme requirement although <i>force majeure<\/i>provisions will be in place to deal with unexpected circumstances such as compulsory purchase orders.<\/p><p>The vast majority of farmers applying for the BDGP will have significantly more land than is required in order to receive full payment.  Based on participants in the Beef Genomics Scheme, nearly half of farmers (46%) will have a stocking density of less than 0.5 calved cows\/hectare whereas 90% of farmers have a stocking density below 1 calved cow per hectare.  As an example, a farmer with 10 calved cows and a stocking density of 0.5 will have access to 20 hectares but will only require 6.66 hectares for the purposes of payment under the BDGP.  Even if this farmer had a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare, he\/she would have 50% more land than he\/she requires.  The vast majority of farmers come under a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare and I believe the relatively high stocking density of 1.5 established under the BDGP should provide a sufficient buffer for situations arising on most farms.<\/p><p>The BDGP has been approved under the agri-environment provisions in the Rural Development regulation and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd.  The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers.  Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases.  In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty however, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations.  The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme.  As always in such cases, <i>force majeure <\/i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease.  There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.  <\/p><p>The BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose.  The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review over the next five years.  If that finds that aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600070#WRS04700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600070#WRS04800"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[20416\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600070#WRS04900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 343 and 344 of 12 May 2015, if he is aware that the person (details supplied) in County Westmeath actually applied for the herd number to the relevant district veterinary office on 24 April 2014, and a copy of the said application is available to prove same; if, in this context, this decision will be reviewed, with a view to ensuring that the person obtains a payment for 2014 under the single payment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":880,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2014 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; scheme application on 15 May 2014.

I can confirm that in all of my overseas travel I will continue to promote Ireland as a good place for doing business and as a destination for foreign direct investment.<table><tr><th>Date <\/th><th>Destination <\/th><th>Purpose of visit <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>4 June <\/td><td>Milan <\/td><td>EXPO Milan international agriculture forum <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 June<\/td><td>Lisbon<\/td><td>Blue week world ocean summit conference  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16 June<\/td><td>Luxembourg <\/td><td>Council of EU Agriculture Ministers  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7\/8 July <\/td><td>Strasbourg <\/td><td>Plenary meeting of European Parliament  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13 July <\/td><td>Brussels <\/td><td>Council of EU Agriculture Ministers  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>w\/c 7 September<\/td><td>United States<\/td><td>Trade mission (provisional) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14\/15 September <\/td><td>Luxembourg <\/td><td>Informal meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>22\/23 October <\/td><td>Luxembourg <\/td><td>Council of EU Agriculture Ministers  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>w\/c 2 November <\/td><td>China and possibly other Asian countries <\/td><td>Trade mission (provisional)  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16\/17 November <\/td><td>Brussels <\/td><td>Council of EU Agriculture Ministers  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>w\/c 30 November  <\/td><td>West Africa <\/td><td>Trade mission (provisional)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14\/15 December <\/td><td>Brussels <\/td><td>Council of EU Agriculture Ministers  <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600071#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":890,"content":"<p>Question No. 422 answered with Question No. 416.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":891,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600071#WRT00550"},{"type":"question","counter":892,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[20477\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600071#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the Premier of China, Mr Li Keqiang, and other Chinese officials, on 17 May 2015.","asker":"1197","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":893,"content":"<p>Last year, Irish agri-food exports to China increased to &euro;620 million, making China Ireland&rsquo;s second most important market, after the EU as a whole. Therefore, a long with the Taoiseach, I was very pleased to welcome Premier Li Keqiang and a large Ministerial delegation, including Minister for Agriculture Han Changfu, on a visit to the Garvey farm in Co. Mayo on 17 May.<\/p><p>This visit represented an invaluable opportunity to demonstrate the best of Irish farming to the Chinese Government.  The farm is typical of Ireland&rsquo;s natural, grass-based, sustainable production systems.  It combines traditional values and the best of nature with science and technology, to produce the highest quality food, with three generations of the family working together. It was a wonderful showcase for Irish food production, and I would again like to thank the Garvey family for their enthusiasm and hospitality in welcoming the large delegation to their farm and their home. <\/p><p>During our discussions in the Garvey farmhouse, Premier Li Keqiang was particularly interested in learning more about Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Origin Green&rsquo; sustainability programme, under which farmers and food producers set and achieve measurable sustainability targets, which are independently verified and audited. <\/p><p>Following the bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach and Premier Li in Ashford Castle, Minister Han Changfu and I signed a joint statement on deepening agricultural cooperation, including through:<\/p><p>- the establishment of an Ireland-China Joint Committee on Agricultural Cooperation and<\/p><p>- the development of a Medium-Term Action Plan on Agricultural Co-operation.<\/p><p>Ireland greatly appreciates the lifting of the ban on Irish beef imports by China, which I regard as a powerful endorsement of Ireland&rsquo;s high standards by an administration for which food safety is a critical prerequisite for trade.

","asker":"1063","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":937,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 437, 438, 440 and 444 together. <\/p><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and will provide suckler farmers in Ireland with funding of some &euro;300 million over the next 6 years.  The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.<\/p><p>The BDGP has been approved under the agri-environment provisions of the Rural Development Regulations and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd.  The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers.  Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.<\/p><p>The six year timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme.  It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases.  In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty however, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure <\/i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease.  There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.<\/p><p>The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and most of the actions will already be familiar to most farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements.  The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP over and above existing schemes for the suckler beef sector.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins.  The requirement for farmers to move towards using 4 and 5 star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to the programmes objectives.  An adjustment to allow the use of 3 star animals and heifer calves under 16 months would require engagement with the Commission and would jeopardise the operation of the programme. <\/p><p>In addition, I should note that many farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for 4 and 5 star animals.  Analysis undertaken by ICBF of the 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme has indicated that some 30% of herds are already compliant with the requirement for female animals in 2020 i.e. that the number of 4 and 5 star heifers are equal to 50% of the reference animals on each farm.  Furthermore, 52% are already compliant with the 2018 requirement.  All farmers will receive comprehensive training, and ongoing information and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy.  I am also aware that these requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time included in the design of the programme.<\/p><p>The requirement for those farmers using a stock bull is that at least one of the bulls on the holding on 30 June 2019 must be a genotyped 4 or 5 star bull on either the terminal or replacement index.  There are separate provisions for farmers using AI. <\/p><p>I do not believe this represents a large additional cost on the sector given the large number of 4 and 5 star bulls already on suckler farms and the benefits will outweigh any such costs.  Analysis undertaken by the ICBF has shown that there will be a sufficient quantity of such bulls available for BDGP herds.  Approximately 10,000 pedigree bulls will be eligible for the scheme each year whereas, based on the 2014 Beef Genomic Scheme, the BDGP herds would require about 7,000 such animals each year.  There is also a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. <\/p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his\/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo;.  The number of &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo; will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme.  For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype 9 cows\/heifers\/calves\/stock bulls, in each year of the programme, without repetition.<\/p><p>The 60% of the herd that will be genotyped each year represents an increase compared to the 15% under the 2014 Beef Genomic Scheme, however the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes.  The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP. <\/p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified.  The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and, importantly, ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds.  <\/p><p>Of course, like all RDP schemes, the payments under this programme are calculated to cover costs and income foregone including a substantial overhead.<\/p><p>The cost of the genotyping will be finalised following the conclusion of a public tendering process undertaken by the ICBF in relation to laboratory analysis, tissue tags and the DNA chip. It is expected that this will result in a reduced sampling\/genotype cost compared to the 2014 scheme.<\/p><p>Participants in the BDGP will receive advice and guidance on an ongoing basis to assist them in meeting the requirements.  The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review.  If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission in a manner consistent with the relevant regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600072#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Data Programme","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600072#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[20698\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600072#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation will be charging farmers on the new beef data genomics programme to be compliant with the genotyping requirements of the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.<\/p><p>The BDGP was launched on 5 May and to-date my Department has received almost 13,000 applications.  The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and all of the actions will already be familiar to most farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements.  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  This is a statutory requirement for RDP schemes.  All of the costs to the farmer, including a substantial overhead for time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.  The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing, and this will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment. <\/p><p>The cost of completing a carbon navigator in conjunction with an approved advisor will be covered separately and will not be deducted from the farmer&rsquo;s payment.  The farmer will also be provided with an additional &euro;166 to compensate for the time and travel costs associated with attending the training course.<\/p><p>There has been some concern regarding the requirement to join the scheme for a 6 year period.  This multi-annual approach is required for all EU funded agri-environmental schemes and, in any event, should facilitate long term planning on individual farms.  We have also included <i>force majeure<\/i>clauses in the Terms and Conditions to deal with situations where a farmer has to withdraw from the programme due to circumstances beyond his or her control such as illness or disease. <i><\/i>There is also a facility to transfer the land in certain circumstances, including inheritance.  In any event, the vast majority of farmers will have far more land than they will need to draw down their full BDGP payment and a re free to dispose of or transfer surplus land as they wish.<\/p><p>The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins.  This scheme is putting &euro;300 million into accelerating genetic improvement and so the requirement for farmers to move towards using 4 and 5 star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to its objectives.  I am fully aware that these requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time provided in the scheme design.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to add that both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers.  I also issued some updated information on the contents of the scheme last week, particularly as regards the 6-year requirement and the penalties which apply under the scheme.  In addition, farmer&rsquo;s can consult the Department&rsquo;s website for more information and I would encourage them to contact the Department&rsquo;s helpline if they have any further questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600072#WRU02000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":959,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[20710\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600072#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied that it is appropriate to limit the availability of the scheme based on the number of calved cows in 2014, which clearly delimits the ability to expand and increase suckler cow numbers in future years; if farmers could be permitted to apply on all of the suckler cows in their herd in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":960,"content":"<p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and will provide suckler farmers in Ireland with funding of some &euro;300 million over the next 6 years.

Under the 2009 Act, authorisations for surveillance are granted by a judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces in circumstances which are set out in the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a member of the Defence Forces or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners shall carry out surveillance only in accordance with a valid authorisation. In that regard an application for a valid authorisation must be made by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a judge of the District Court where the officer is of the view that:<\/p>  <p>(a) as part of an operation or investigation being conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning an arrestable offence, the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purposes of obtaining information as to whether the offence has been committed or as to the circumstances relating to the commission of the offence, or obtaining evidence for the purposes of proceedings in relation to the offence,<\/p>  <p>(b) the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purpose of preventing the commission of arrestable offences, or<\/p>  <p>(c) the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the security of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Exceptionally, in accordance with Section 7 of the Act, an approval may be granted without recourse to the District Court in very limited circumstances as set out in the Act where grounds of urgency exist. An approval may also be granted in accordance with Section 8 where tracking devices are to be used. The approval for the use of a tracking device is limited to providing information on the location of a person, vehicle or thing. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard the Designated Judge appointed to oversee the operation of the Act under Section 12 has noted, in his most recent report to the Taoiseach, that he was satisfied that applications under section 7 of the Act were properly made and that, where approvals were granted under section 8, that appropriate consideration had been given to the proportionality of the actions for which approval was sought. He was also satisfied that the provisions of the Act had been complied with in all respects.  <\/p>  <p>  I should also add that in the performance of his statutory role, the Designated Judge has unimpeded access to all documentation and personnel relevant to this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  He commented favourably on his experiences in his dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and concluded that it was evident from the files inspected that the use of such devices has been of great assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the detection and prosecution of offences and in the monitoring of persons suspected of being involved in  activities which could threaten the security of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that in addition to independent judicial oversight by a designated Judge of the High Court, a complaints mechanism is provided for in the legislation whereby any individual who believes that they have been the victim of improper use of the legislation may have their complaint investigated by an independent Complaints Referee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600074#WRW03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Numbers","counter":1068,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600074#WRW03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1069,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[19950\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600074#WRW03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the 300 migrants who we have agreed to resettle, as part of the European Union plan to tackle the current migration crisis, will be automatically granted refugee status, or if they will be forced to go into direct provision as asylum seekers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1070,"content":"<p>All persons admitted to Ireland for permanent resettlement are granted programme refugee status on arrival, in the normal course programme refugees are accommodated by the Reception and Integration Agency for a period to facilitate a language training and orientation programme and while accommodation is sourced in local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600074#WRW03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1071,"content":"<p>Question No. 484 answered with Question No. 482.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1072,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600074#WRW04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1073,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[19980\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600074#WRW04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will support legislation in order to end sex-trafficking and prostitution; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1074,"content":"<p>On 27 November, I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.

It is the intention to complete the Bill so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will come into operation without delay this year. <\/p><p>The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged. Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 123 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.  VAT exemptions for fees in family law cases are not under consideration.<\/p><p>Under the Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, backed up, for the first time in legislation, by a set of Legal Costs Principles and published legal costs determinations. The Bill will also pave the way for the introduction of new business structures combining legal and other service providers so that they can combine to meet the needs of consumers in a more cost-effective way. In England and Wales, for example, greater cost transparency has been achieved and savings have been made by consumers in specific areas of family law since the introduction of these new legal business models. <\/p><p>In addition to these legal services and costs reforms there are other family litigation supports which deserve mention. The Deputy will wish to know that family law proceedings are, in fact, exempt from the payment of court fees.  In terms of assisting those engaged in family law litigation who are most in need, it must also be recognised that family law continues to constitute the predominant area where the Legal Aid Board provides legal services. Of the cases handled by the Board in 2013, 85 per cent, that is to say 12,936 cases, were in the family law area. Moreover, since 2011, the Board also has responsibility for the Family Mediation Service, which is staffed by professionally trained and accredited mediators through a network of full- and part-time offices around the country.The service is currently free.<\/p><p>In general, as set out in Section 29(1)(b) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, clients being provided with legal aid make a payment before they see a solicitor (an advice contribution) and a further payment before their solicitor represents them in court (an aid contribution). The amount of the payment is based on the person&rsquo;s disposable income and, where their capital assets (excluding their family home) exceed &euro;4,000, their disposable capital also. The minimum contribution is usually &euro;30 for legal advice and &euro;130 for legal aid. Most of the applicants for the Board&rsquo;s services pay these minimum contributions. The service which the Board provides is a full service involving advice, representation (including in certain cases the services of legal counsel), implementation and enforcement. It should be noted that VAT is not paid on contributions.<\/p><p>In respect of the rare cases in which the contribution might be significant, section 28(4)(c) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 specifically allows the Board to refuse legal aid where the contribution is likely to exceed the amount of fees which an applicant might be charged if he\/she went to a private solicitor. In practice this provision has only rarely been applied as the costs of privately delivered services usually will exceed any contribution which might be charged.<\/p><p>In replying to the Deputy, I also understand that persons who apply for legal services to defend proceedings brought by the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) to take children into state care or to supervise them in their own homes do not pay a contribution towards legal services. In addition, section 29(2)(b) of the Act provides that the Board can waive any contribution due, or accept a lower contribution, in cases where failure to do so would cause undue hardship to the applicant. In most family law cases involving persons who are in receipt of legal aid the usual practice is for the Court to make no order as to costs at the end of the case. This means that each party pays their own costs. In the unusual event that costs are awarded against the other party the Board is required to seek to recover its costs from the costs awarded and the person in receipt of legal aid is under an obligation to assist the Board in doing this.<\/p><p>Provision is also made under section 33(7) of the 1995 Act which can mean that if a person recovers any settlement monies these must be paid into the Legal Aid Fund. This is to enable the Board to recover the costs of providing the service to the legally aided person. If any property other than the person&rsquo;s home is recovered or preserved it is subject to a charge in favour of the Legal Aid Fund. The Board will generally cap the solicitor&rsquo;s fees element of any costs recovered from a person receiving legal aid in judicial separation and divorce cases at &euro;5,000. It will not recover its costs from newly awarded maintenance, nor from maintenance arrears where the amount recovered is less than &euro;3174.35. Section 33(8) of the Act provides that the Board can waive any money or property it is due under section 33(7) if not to do so would cause hardship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600076#WRY02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":1160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600076#WRY02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1161,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[20518\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600076#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the grounds on which the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has determined that persons (details supplied) are not fully self-sufficient in the State, or that they can remain self-sufficient into the future; and if she will put a stay on a deportation order issued against these persons, until that determination can be examined.","asker":"1047","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1162,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, in response to separate notifications pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the persons concerned have submitted written representations.

These functions are provided from the Burgh Quay offices in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The office also provides a range of other immigration related services with approximately 130,000 people per annum attending in person at the office.  These include applications for re-entry visas administered by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department which are issued to visa-required nationals resident in Ireland to ensure they can return to this State after leaving the jurisdiction for visit purposes.  This office is probably one of the busiest Public Offices with some of the longest opening times in the State.  <\/p><p>The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to five-hundred people who attend at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at this registration office, to ensure that those attending are dealt with on a 'first come first served' basis.  In addition those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return at the appropriate time if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.  Specific times are set aside for certain categories of persons such as students.  Indeed, for the peak student period in autumn last year the office opened on Saturdays.  Tickets are not issued to non-nationals whose registration relates to their presence in Ireland for study related purposes until after 9am so as to facilitate those non-nationals whose permission to reside in the State is work related.  <\/p><p>In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an announcement  is posted on the Garda Website alerting customers to the number of available tickets remaining at the Burgh Quay public office for that day.<\/p><p>It is a requirement of the registration function that persons seeking to register present in person to their local registration office.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  The registration process includes an interview with the person, the examination of relevant documentation, photographing and biometric capture and the issuing of a registration certificate.  It also includes the placing of the appropriate permission to remain endorsement on the passport of the person concerned.  It should also be noted that for most persons, renewal of their registration is at most a yearly requirement and that for the majority of customers the GNIB provides a <i>'<\/i>same day service<i><\/i>at its Burgh Quay office.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a major reform of the delivery of immigration services is underway including the transfer of registration functions from the GNIB to the INIS.  This presents opportunities to streamline both registration and visa re-entry services and INIS is working on introducing on-line services as part of this process including a booking system for appointments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600077#WRZ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insolvency Service of Ireland Data","counter":1204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600077#WRZ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1205,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[20751\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600077#WRZ02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of bankruptcies that have been annulled or set aside in each year since 2011 and to date in 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1206,"content":"<p>The Insolvency Service of Ireland has provided the figures for the numbers of bankruptcies annulled or set aside in the years from 2011 to date in 2015 and these are in the table.

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  <\/p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of organised crime. <\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.     <\/p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.  <\/p>  <p>  At international level, the question of how best to deal with participation in and\/or directing a criminal organisation through the criminal law has been the subject of debate in the development of common international standards.

In September 2014 officials from my Department and the Child and Family Agency met with the National Carers' Association to discuss the role of the Department and the Agency in relation to the National Carers' Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 brings together a range of existing services for children and families to one agency.  The Child and Family Agency is responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.  The Agency's functions include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families. In so doing the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation to ensure that services are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015\/16 academic year. The Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its service strands.<\/p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles.<\/p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support. I am pleased that representatives of the Carers' Association participated in the consultation process in the development of this strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600079#WRBB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":1314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600079#WRBB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1315,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[20484\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600079#WRBB03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount of funding allocated to County Louth for each of the years 2010 to 2014 and in 2015 to date under the school completion programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1316,"content":"<p>The School Completion Programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort.

These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific issues raised by the Deputy, the Department of Health has informed my Department that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.<\/p>  <p>  Improving access to the pre-school year for children with special needs is a priority for my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The intersectoral work done under the chairmanship of the Office of the Minister for Disability and Mental Health and through the Cross Sectoral Team on children&rsquo;s disability issues agreed that the best approach to meeting the needs of children with a disability of pre-school age was through mainstream pre-school services, but no agreement was reached on what the model of provision would be, or, who would lead out on developing this.<\/p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department has recently agreed with his counterparts in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills that my Department will seek to gain agreement, in a relatively short time-frame, between the three sectors (children, education, health) on the most appropriate, workable model for supports to pre-school children with special needs. This will be followed by very close co-operation between the sectors in defining\/developing the model and in making an agreed cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required to implement it. The team will use information from recent consultations with parents and providers to inform their work and will conduct further consultation as the tight time-frame allows.<\/p>  <p>  There will be several challenges to agreeing an appropriate and workable model &ndash; including reviewing existing resources in the system to determine how they can best meet children&rsquo;s&rsquo; needs, and accessing the additional investment needed.

Consultation with stakeholders, including carers, was a key element of the development of these policy initiatives, and this will continue to be the case. For example, carers were included in recent consultations on draft interim day service standards for people with disabilities which are nearing finalisation. Families and carers are also an integral part of the consultation and planning process for the transition of people living in congregated settings to community living. The provision of respite services is a vital part of the continuum of services which the HSE provides to support the families of people with disabilities. This year 5,274 people with a disability are expected to avail of residential centre-based respite services, utilising 190,003 bed nights, and increasing use is being made of newer and more innovative forms of non-centre-based respite services.<\/p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy notes that 80% of the main caregivers to people over the age of 50 are themselves aged 50 or over and approximately 20% of these are over 65. It states that Ireland's ageing population, coupled with medical advances in relation to disability and chronic illness, will result in more older people being cared for in the community in the years ahead. Under National Goal 2 of the Strategy which is to support people as they age to maintain, improve or manage their physical and mental health and wellbeing, Objective 2.3 explicitly stresses the need to recognise and support the role of carers by implementing the National Carers' Strategy.<\/p><p>The vital role of carers is also explicitly acknowledged in the recently published National Dementia Strategy (2014) which states that carers are the cornerstone of care for people with dementia living in the community. Carers' needs are accordingly prioritised throughout the Strategy. Section 6 of the Strategy focuses on integrated services, supports and care for people with dementia and their carers, and a number of the priority actions relate to the supports that need to be available both to people with dementia and to their carers to enable them to continue in their caring role. These include home care packages, respite care and access to information on available services and supports.

The Government has commenced this process in respect of all children under 6 years. The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was enacted on 25th July 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Agreement has been reached between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation on terms for the delivery of GP care without fees for all children aged under 6.  Under the new arrangements, an additional 270,000 children under 6 will benefit from GP care free at the point of service.  All children under 6 will benefit from the new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract. <\/p>  <p>  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease.  These assessments will be carried out when a child is aged 2 and again at age 5.  The contract will also cover an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma, under which GPs will carry out an annual review of each child where the doctor has diagnosed asthma.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with this, GP care without fees will be extended to all persons aged 70 years and over, subject to the passing of the necessary legislation.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2015, which was published on 25 March 2015, will provide the statutory basis for the over-70s universal GP service.  This service will benefit about 36,000 people and will be provided under the existing GMS contract. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises that different age-groups have different healthcare needs and ability to access services and that children and older people have particular needs in this regard.  For many years we have had universal eligibility for acute hospital services but the first and most effective point of contact with the health service which is provided by GP's has only been provided on a public basis to those on very low incomes. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of universal GP access through greater public investment in primary care services is a critical reform in resolving inequities and re-balancing our services towards earlier prevention.  The introduction of universal GP access for the youngest and oldest members of our community is an important step in the phased implementation of these reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600084#WRGG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme Coverage","counter":1540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600084#WRGG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1541,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[20117\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600084#WRGG01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason Fampyra for patients suffering with multiple sclerosis is not covered under the drugs scheme; when this medication will be included; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1082","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1542,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.

","asker":"1069","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1564,"content":"<p>The Report &ldquo;The Establishment of Hospital Groups as a Transition to Independent Hospital Trusts&rdquo; was published in February 2013. This report recommended the establishment of seven Hospital Groups which have now been set up on a non-statutory administrative basis. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2014, the HSE launched the Community Health care Organisations (CHO) Report. The Report sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system into nine CHOs.  The primary focus is to meet the maximum proportion of people's care needs in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services. <\/p>  <p>  In determining the optimum organisational model for the CHOs, the HSE identified a requirement for integration between the different parts of the community health care services; between community health care services and acute hospitals; with wider public service organisations such as local authorities, the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the education sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and with local voluntary organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The option selected was arrived at after consideration of a number of options, details of which are contained in the HSE report on Community Health care Organisations. The option selected was deemed the most appropriate on the basis that it met a key requirement of linking primary care teams and networks with acute hospitals; it provided a strong basis for linkage with local authority boundaries and it struck an appropriate balance between an organisation of sufficiently large scale to support organisation and business capability, while at the same time being of sufficiently small scale to provide the local community connection and response required to deliver integrated care.<\/p>  <p>  The CHO structures became effective in January 2015. It is envisaged that the principal day-to-day linkages at clinical and patient level will be between the primary care networks and the relevant service within the Hospital Group.  There will also be significant inter-Hospital Group interfaces for certain national services and it is envisaged that individual CHOs will interface with hospitals from more than one Hospital Group. Work to give effect to these interfaces is comprehended by the reform programmes currently underway in the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600085#WRHH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600085#WRHH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1566,"qnumday":661,"qnumall":"[20204\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600085#WRHH00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons waiting for cataract operations, per county; the length of time they are waiting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1567,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[20205\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600085#WRHH00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost to clear the current cataract waiting list; if he will provide funding for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1568,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[20206\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600085#WRHH01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reduce waiting times for cataract operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1569,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 661 to 663, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.

This represents an increase of &euro;54m on the 2014 figures. <\/p>  <p>  There are several important safeguards built into the scheme which ensure that both the person entering long-term nursing home care and their spouse\/partner are adequately provided for:<\/p>  <p>  - Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.<\/p>  <p>  - The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.<\/p>  <p>  - The principal residence (and farms\/businesses in certain circumstances) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care.<\/p>  <p>  - Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p>  <p>  - If there is a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will retain 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p>  <p>  - The scheme also provides for certain items of expenditure, 'allowable deductions', to be taken into account during the financial assessment. These include health expenses, levies required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person's principal residence.<\/p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. This review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche Consultants on specific issues which required specialised expertise. The review is considering the long term sustainability of the Scheme including funding arrangements.  No decisions have been taken nor plans in place regarding changes to the way the Scheme currently operates.<\/p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, as well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, is expected to identify some of the broader issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people, how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and whether new care approaches can contribute positively. A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600086#WRJJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600086#WRJJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1615,"qnumday":679,"qnumall":"[20322\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600086#WRJJ00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a child may be deemed eligible for a medical card where the parent who receives the child benefit payment does not qualify under the medical card scheme but the other parent who lives separately holds a full medical card, in view of the fact that the child may incur medical costs when staying with the parent who currently holds a medical card and that parent may not be in a position to pay for the necessary medical care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in Budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels. The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy, outlining planned pay expenditure and staff numbers.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction will be issued. As this process is still ongoing, the existing moratorium and Employment Control Framework arrangements will continue to apply. However the number of staff employed has already increased by over 900 since January, the majority of whom are frontline staff, including speech therapists.

The Strategy is a cross cutting area of public policy and service delivery which requires a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and Agencies, in conjunction with the Community and Voluntary sectors to tackling the drugs problem.    <\/p>  <p>  Prevention and awareness programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem particularly among young persons.  The Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) Programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drug and alcohol issues in schools.  The Department of Health's Drugs Initiative provides almost &euro;4m in funding to 61 education and prevention-specific community drugs projects.  Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces operate a range of education and prevention programmes locally which aim to promote healthier lifestyle choices among young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of problem drug use.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, young people at risk of drug misuse can access diversionary programmes, facilities and services and family support.  Significant investment is being made in the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, which seeks to divert at risk young people from becoming involved in criminal behaviour including drug-related crime and in preventing their succumbing to drug misuse.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of appropriate and timely treatment services is a key goal of the Strategy.  At the end of December 2014, 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week of assessment and 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment.  An additional &euro;2.1 million has been provided in the HSE budget this year for measures targeting vulnerable problem drug users, including the provision of more residential detoxification and rehabilitation places.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is beginning work on the development of a new Strategy for the period after 2016.  The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.  It will also take account of evidence-based research, information and data sources on the extent and nature of problem drug use in Ireland.

Since the publication of the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s Report on Portlaoise last year, much has been done to strengthen services in the hospital, and HIQA has acknowledged this.  New management is in place, with significantly improved clinical governance and additional key clinical staff have been appointed. <\/p>  <p>  Portlaoise Hospital is now part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and the Government is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Hospital. Any change to its services will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner guided by what is best in terms of patient safety and outcomes. It is not appropriate to comment further at this time, other than to note that a number of staff have had complaints made to their professional regulatory bodies, in relation to their involvement in care in Portlaoise. These will be investigated in line with standard procedures and due process will apply. In addition, the HSE is finalising an investigation, in line with its Code of  Governance and Disciplinary Procedures, which may result in disciplinary action being taken against individuals involved.<\/p>  <p>  I have made enforcement of the implementation of HIQA recommendations a clear priority within the priorities I outlined earlier this year. Informed by the recommendations contained in the published HIQA investigation reports on various hospital services and based on analysis and internal discussions on patient safety priorities, I have come to the conclusion that providing a national focus for patient safety is best achieved by strengthening the patient safety role and functions of my Department. I intend to develop a significantly enhanced patient safety function within my Department with a clear mandate to provide the required leadership, direction and oversight for national improvements in patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience. The policy oversight for this function will be integrated within the existing system of accountability which operates through me as Minister for Health.  <\/p>  <p>  The Authority's Report further recommends that I should establish an oversight committee in the Department to ensure that the Portlaoise Report's recommendations are implemented. I have approved the membership, terms of reference and reporting arrangements of the committee which will be chaired by the Chief Medical Officer. The HSE will submit a plan and timetable to implement the recommendations; this plan will be used by the oversight committee to monitor the HSE's progress on implementation.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I plan to establish a fully independent national advocacy service. The scope, role and functions of the independent advocacy service will be considered along with the appropriate structural, governance and funding arrangements that need to be put in place.

Activity Based Funding (ABF) is a new model for funding public hospital care.  ABF is intended to ensure a fairer system of resource allocation to hospitals. Hospitals will be funded based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients, and will be encouraged, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance. Full roll-out of ABF is a multi-year project and a phased approach to implementation is being taken in order to ensure operational stability in hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600087#WRKK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1679,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600087#WRKK02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1680,"qnumday":701,"qnumall":"[20465\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600087#WRKK02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to establish a database for children born with Down's syndrome; if consideration has been given to the benefit which such information gathering could potentially yield, particularly for the planning of both health and educational services, by providing information on trends in demographics, current service use and future service need; if he is aware of the great difficulty which the current absence of such a database creates with regard to adequate service provision and future planning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1681,"content":"<p>The Minister for Health has no plans to establish a database for children born with the condition Down Syndrome.  <\/p>  <p>  In planning for the delivery of intellectual disability services, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and disability service providers maintain the National Intellectual Disability Database (NIDD).

Agreement between public service management and public service staff representatives was reached on a series of measures to secure an additional &euro;1 billion annual saving from the public service pay and pensions bill by 2015. A key requirement for the health service during the process was to protect front-line care while at the same time significantly reducing costs.<\/p>  <p>  Savings have been achieved through the reduction in the overtime rates payable, the elimination of twilight payments. Savings were also achieved through the reduction to pay for those in receipt of salaries of &euro;65,000, measures to delay or freeze increments, and balancing measures for those already at the maximum of their scales. In addition, the HRA provides for an increase in working hours for most staff and this will deliver a long-term, sustainable and unprecedented increase in productivity.   <\/p>  <p>  As part of the HRA a Joint Oversight Group was established to provide a forum for discussion between management and unions with a view, as far as possible, to oversee and support implementation of the terms of the Agreement as they apply to the health service.

This role involves post market surveillance of products that have been placed on the market and are in use. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA has no direct role in the authorisation of any medical device before it is placed on the market.  Medical devices such as food intolerance tests can be placed on the European market once they bear a CE mark issued by an independent certification body known as a 'notified body'. The notified body carries out a conformity assessment to confirm that the devices meets specified safety and performance requirements.  The HPRA does not approve or certify these devices for sale in Ireland or any other country, nor does it have a role in regulating the provision of food intolerance testing services by pharmacies, clinics and other entities that may be providing such services.  <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA issued a Medical Devices Information Notice on 24 March 2015 on Food Intolerance Testing.  This Notice may be found on the HPRA website.  The HPRA position, as set out in the Information Notice, is that the diagnosis of any condition relating to the ability to digest or \"tolerate\" foods should  be made in careful consultation with a doctor who is familiar with the patient's health history and should not be based on the use of self testing alone.  The HPRA does not recommend using these tests or interpreting results without this involvement as it may have negative health effects such as the removal of important food groups from an individual&rsquo;s diet, or the potential misdiagnosis of a serious medical condition.  <\/p>  <p>  In January the HPRA commenced an active surveillance programme on food intolerance tests.  This involves reviewing the performance and safety implications of the products and services available on the market. As part of this surveillance programme, the HPRA is cooperating with European regulatory partners, including the United Kindgom, as many of the products available in Ireland have been manufactured or received their CE mark from  notified bodies in the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  At European level, the regulatory framework for medical devices is currently being reviewed.  The purpose of this review is to strengthen the legislation including improvements to market surveillance and clinical evaluation of medical devices. The progression of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the HPRA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600090#WRNN03000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1839,"content":"<p>Question No. 760 answered with Question No. 722.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care Provision","counter":1840,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600091#WROO00275"},{"type":"question","counter":1841,"qnumday":761,"qnumall":"[20859\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600091#WROO00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in establishing the right to home care support on a statutory footing; and the timeframe now proposed for same.

Over the past two weeks, there has been a wave of killings, militias have acted with impunity, and the country has experienced arbitrary arrests, intimidation, forced closures of media outlets and the targeting of human rights defenders.  I have condemned the coup attempt by senior military figures on 13 and 14 May, which added to the rising toll of death and injury and increased the numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons.<\/p>  <p>  Burundi has experienced recurring violence over the years since its independence in 1962.  The recent street protests arose in response to a decision by the ruling party to name President Pierre Nkurunziza as its candidate for a third presidential term in elections scheduled for June.  Widespread complaints that this breaches established term-limits were considered by the Constitutional Court of Burundi, which pronounced on 5 May that the candidacy is constitutional.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed the situation in Burundi at the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 18 May.  The Council condemned the attempted coup, highlighted the need for restraint, re-stated the importance of inclusive and transparent political dialogue and expressed support for the mediation efforts of the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative, the African Union and the East African Community.  The Council also stressed the importance of a credible, transparent and non-violent election process in the country and noted that, as conditions conducive to the holding of elections are not in place at the moment, they should be postponed within constitutional limitations. <\/p>  <p>  I am also following the situation in Burundi through our Ambassador in Dar-es-Salaam, who is also accredited to Burundi.  I am particularly concerned about the plight of Burundian refugees, with as many as 47,000 now in Tanzania.  Our Embassy in Dar-es-Salaam is closely monitoring refugee movements and engaging with and supporting the local efforts of the UN High Commission for Refugees.

We have also been following closely the case of vulnerable migrants, including members of the Rohingya community that have been stranded at sea in the Bay of Bengal and off the coast of South East Asia. Many migrants have landed in Malaysia and Indonesia in recent months including into the Indonesian province of Aceh. 1700 migrants are reported to have landed into this province.<\/p><p>Ireland welcomes the commitment announced on May 20 by the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to resolve the issue of these refugees and migrants. A solution is of the utmost importance given that the UN says that some 920 migrants are known to have perished in the Bay of Bengal between September 2014 and March 2015. The priority now must be to ensure that lives are saved and these people receive any required medical treatment and appropriate care. Ireland welcomes the commitment of Indonesia and Malaysia to allow these migrants to safely disembark.<\/p><p>In their statement from 20 May, the Ministers from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have said that further action will be needed including addressing the reasons for the continued flow of migrants into these nations. Ireland supports calls by the UN High Commissioner and others for the countries in the region and the international community to work together to address these root causes.<\/p><p>Ireland also welcomes the announcement that Thailand will host a regional meeting on irregular migration in the Indian Ocean on 29 May. We hope that a basis for further cooperation between regional countries and possible ways forward and solutions can be found at this meeting.<\/p><p>The underlying root causes of the migration in the region include the ethnic tensions that exist in Rakhine State in Myanmar\/Burma which is home to the Rohingya people, and this issue along with all other root causes must be addressed as part of a long term solution. Ireland believes that it is imperative that there should be a guarantee of respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar\/Burma and throughout the region. <\/p><p>Ireland has called for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both the Rohingya community and the Buddhist community in Rakhine State, but a longer term Government of Myanmar Strategy for rehabilitation and reconciliation is required.<\/p><p>As a member of the UN Human Rights Council for the term 2012-2015, Ireland has also expressed concerns about the human rights situation of minorities in Myanmar. On March 16 of this year in Geneva, Ireland made a statement during the interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, at the 28th session of the UN Human Rights Council. We fully supported the view of the Special Rapporteur that the severe curtailment of the rights of internally displaced persons, in detention and with limited access to essential services, is a serious violation of human rights law and must be immediately addressed. Ireland also co-sponsored the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, which reiterated the HRC&rsquo;s serious concern about the situation of persons belonging to the Rohingya minority and other minorities in Rakhine State. The HRC decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and requested a progress report to the General Assembly at its 70th session and to the HRC in accordance with its annual programme of work. The resolution was adopted by consensus.<\/p><p>The Irish Embassy in Vietnam, which is accredited to Myanmar\/Burma, closely monitors this issue, and, in September 2013, the Ambassador travelled to Rakhine State to assess the situation on the ground.  Most recently, the Ambassador visited Naypyidaw on 23 May 2014 and met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  At that meeting he expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the situation of the Rohingya people in Rakhine State and humanitarian access to the region. In 2015, Irish Aid will provide &euro;80,000 to <i>Plan International<\/i>to help to address the humanitarian needs of the Rohingya community in Rakhine State.<\/p><p>Ireland will continue, through relevant bilateral and multilateral channels, to press the authorities in Myanmar to address the serious situation in Rakhine State, as part of a continuing process of democratic transformation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":1895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1896,"qnumday":779,"qnumall":"[20306\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding overseas aid (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1897,"content":"<p>2015 is a crucial year for international development.  We are preparing for three interlinked international conferences: in Addis in July on financing for development, in New York in September on a new set of Sustainable Development Goals and in Paris in December on a new climate treaty.  I will lead the Irish delegation to the Conference in Addis, the outcome of which will be essential for success in the subsequent conferences.  Ireland is playing a strong international role in the overall process to agree a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals, post-2015.<\/p>  <p>  The contours of a useful agreement will need to be broad if they are to support the new set of Sustainable Development Goals to be adopted at the major Summit at the UN in New York.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be a vitally important element of the package, but agreement will also be needed on a much wider range of resources for development.  ODA is particularly important for the fight to end poverty in the Least Developed Countries, including many African countries and fragile states.

Early each year, I agree the annual programme of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led overseas trade missions and events with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, based on the proposals submitted by Enterprise Ireland and focused on the priority markets of interest to their client companies. As part of this programme, I am currently leading a trade mission to South Africa with over thirty Irish companies who are participating in a major drive to increase Irish exports to South Africa. This mission, taking place seven months after President Higgins&rsquo; official visit, will help those Irish companies already active in the South African market to further develop sales and exports contacts, and strengthen their relationships with key contacts.<\/p>  <p>  In late September, I will travel to New York to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations and to address that body on Irish foreign policy priorities.  I will also meet with Foreign Ministers and UN leaders there, to discuss a range of international issues as well as bilateral issues and Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020. Given the importance of our economic relationship with the United States, I anticipate, as on previous visits, to prioritise opportunities to advance our economic interests and will work closely with the economic agencies on an appropriate economic promotion programme. <\/p>  <p>  I will also continue to attend EU related meetings, including meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and Informal Meetings of EU Foreign Ministers, over the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Mr. Se&aacute;n Sherlock T.D., Minister of State for Development, Trade Promotion and North-South Co-operation, led a trade mission to London in recent weeks and is currently preparing to lead a second UK-based mission this week.

The purpose of the visits is to engage with the Irish Communities in these cities, including members of the business community. Minister Deenihan will also travel to London on 30 June, where he will launch an Irish Design 2015 &lsquo;We Built this City&rsquo; event. The aim of the event is to highlight the contribution the Irish Diaspora has made to the building of cities like London.

The world has changed a great deal in the 70 years since the UN&rsquo;s foundation, and we recognise that UN structures must change to reflect this. We believe that the Security Council must be expanded to better reflect these new realities in a regionally balanced way, and to redress the serious under-representation of some regions such as Africa. Equally however, in any reform of the composition of the Security Council, Ireland would want to prevent any diminution in the capacity of smaller Member States, such as Ireland, to serve as non-permanent members on a rotating basis and at regular intervals.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland would oppose the conferral of veto powers on any new Members. Like many other States, we believe that extending the veto right to additional members of the Council would only compound the difficulties associated with the current arrangements regarding veto rights. Ideally, Ireland would wish to see the veto rights of the five permanent members of the Security Council ended altogether, but if this is not possible we see merit in initiatives to regulate the use of the veto.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland sees the five elements for Security Council reform as inter-related parts of a single package [categories of membership, the question of the veto, regional representation, size of an enlarged Council and working methods of the Council, and the relationship between the Council and the General Assembly].  Successful reform is contingent on agreement in all five areas. <\/p>  <p>  We recognise that the bar to agreement on Security Council reform is high. Any amendment to the UN Charter, to give effect to Security Council Reform, would require the approval of two-thirds of the membership of the UN, including all five permanent members of the Security Council. Equally, for reforms to be durable they must enjoy the widest possible support. We would like to think that Member States will be open to compromise in the interest of obtaining overall agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, while full reform of the Council&rsquo;s composition may be some way off, Ireland believes that the working methods of the Council in its current from can be improved. Through our membership of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group of states, we advocate for a more transparent, efficient, inclusive, coherent, legitimate and accountable Security Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":1907,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1908,"qnumday":783,"qnumall":"[20475\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he raised the matter of human rights abuse in China with the Premier of China, Mr Li Keqiang, or his officials on their visit here on 17 May 2015.","asker":"1197","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1909,"content":"<p>Human rights issues were discussed during the visit of Premier Li and his officials.

This was the first meeting of EU Foreign Ministers since the formation of the Israeli government, and in the run up to the meeting I had urged High Representative (HR) Mogherini to include the Peace Process on the Council agenda.  The exchange of views was frank, and Ministers will return to the issue next month for more substantive discussions. For my part, in the exchange of views that took place, I emphasised that the EU has the capacity to make a positive difference and, further, that we have a responsibility to act. The Peace Process itself is at a standstill. We know that events on the ground are rapidly closing the window on a possible two-state solution. We must act to defend that solution which is the core of our policy on the Middle East Peace Process and the only path that will provide peace, security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians alike. I look forward to continuing discussions on the Peace Process next month - at which time HR Mogherini and newly-appointed EU Special Representative for the Peace Process, Fernando Gentilini, will report back to Ministers on their visit to the region, which took place last week.<\/p>  <p>  Foreign Ministers briefly addressed the crisis on the ground in Burundi, where Conclusions were adopted condemning the violence, and re-iterating support for the UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, Sa&iuml;d Djinnit. Concern was also expressed about the crisis in Macedonia. It was agreed to monitor the situation closely, and to discuss the matter again at the Council in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  The Council also met in joint session with Foreign and Defence Ministers, where initially, in the presence of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, we had an exchange of views on the security situation in the EU&rsquo;s broader neighbourhood. <\/p>  <p>  The Council &ndash; EU Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers only  &ndash; then proceeded to discuss  preparations for the European Council in June, where Heads of State and Government will discuss the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Ministers adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions on CSDP which will feed into that discussion. Key areas covered by the conclusions include enhancing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP in contributing to international peace and security; enhancing the development of capabilities required for that purpose and improving the capacity of European industry to provide those capabilities. The conclusions highlight the fact that the EU and its Member States, through CSDP and other policy instruments, have a strong role to play in preventing and managing conflicts and addressing their causes. <\/p>  <p>  HR Mogherini then outlined to us her thinking on a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy. An assessment of the changed global environment will be prepared by HR Mogherini for consideration by Heads of State and Government when they meet next month. It is expected that work will then commence on drafting a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy in consultation with the Member States - Ireland will participate fully in this process. Indeed, having recently concluded a review of our own national foreign policy strategy, I believe it is timely that a similar exercise is conducted at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions then turned to follow up to the Special Meeting of the European Council on 23 April, attended by the Taoiseach, which addressed the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. The FAC adopted a Decision to establish a European Union operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean to disrupt the smuggler networks that drive this criminal trade in human misery and exploit vulnerable people for profit.  The Mission will be called EUNAVFOR MED and will implement its mandate in several phases. In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.  The establishment of this operation is one strand of the comprehensive approach being pursued by the EU to tackle the root causes of the human emergency and to prevent the loss of more lives at sea which also includes continued provision of development  assistance to build capacity in source countries and performance of search and rescue tasks as necessary.  This follows on from the commitment made by Heads of State and Government to use all of the tools at the EU&rsquo;s disposal for this purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":1913,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1914,"qnumday":785,"qnumall":"[20482\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the Premier of China, Mr Li Keqiang, and other Chinese officials on 17 May 2015.","asker":"1197","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1915,"content":"<p>The Chinese Premier, Mr Li Keqiang paid a brief visit to Ireland on 17-18 May.

This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching provision that we have ever had. These increases, building on increases which have already been provided in recent years, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teaching and SNA support to schools to support children with special educational needs and additional care needs respectively.<\/p>  <p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2015\/16 school year by 18th March, 2015. On 21st May, 2015, I announced that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will increase its allocation of Resource Teacher Posts to schools by over 9% for the start of the coming school year.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will allocate 6,454 resource teacher posts to schools for September 2015, which is an increase of 554 posts -or 9.4% - since September 2014. Even in the constrained economic circumstances we have faced in recent years, we have been able to continue to meet the needs of children with special educational needs attending our schools.<\/p>  <p>  This year we have again increased the number of Resource Teachers which will be allocated to schools, keeping pace with both demographic growth and increased demand. The NCSE has now published details of the allocations which will be made to each individual school on the NCSE website ncse.ie. The NCSE will also have a second round allocation process to respond to late enrolments, or from diagnosed disabilities emerging after the closing date for the first allocation round, to the start of the new school year.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will also consider all applications for SNA support which have been made by schools, following which allocations will be made to qualifying schools. Schools will be advised of their revised SNA allocations for the 2015\/16 school year, prior to the end of the current school year. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The procedures for applying for SNA support and resource teaching hours have not changed in the current year. It remains the case that SNA support and Resource teaching hours are allocated on the basis of assessed needs of the qualifying children in line with my Departments policy.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that investment in education has been a priority for this Government and we have been resolutely committed to protecting, and in some instances increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600092#WRPP03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Higher Education Courses Provision","counter":1942,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600093#WRQQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1943,"qnumday":795,"qnumall":"[20628\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600093#WRQQ00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the correspondence (details supplied) regarding Springboard or Momentum courses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1944,"content":"<p>Springboard is a specific initiative that strategically targets funding of free higher education courses to enable unemployed people to upskill or reskill in areas where there are real, identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities.<\/p><p>  Decisions on proposals to be funded are made by an independent panel with industry and educational expertise having regard to published criteria and guidance from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs on current and future skills needs of enterprise.<\/p><p>  The evaluation framework for Springboard provides for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of outputs.

Children with autism over the age of four may also be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them.<\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications for primary and post-primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the National Council Special Education (NCSE) is currently at an advanced stage in the preparation of policy advice on the education of children with autism which includes a review of early intervention provision.  I expect that the NCSE final report, which is to be delivered shortly, will reflect the broadest possible range of views, both National and International and will provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600096#WRTT01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Guidance Counsellors","counter":2074,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600096#WRTT01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2075,"qnumday":856,"qnumall":"[20240\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600096#WRTT01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she is aware of research conducted by a person (details supplied) that details the negative impact felt by students in schools where they do not have access to guidance counselling hours; and her plans to address this matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2076,"content":"<p>I am aware of the research referred to by the Deputy.The research is based on a survey of guidance counsellors and one to one telephone interviews with a small number of them. While the research is useful it is important to note that the survey did not include a school management perspective or encompass the role of other teachers in schools given that guidance provision is a whole school activity.<\/p><p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.<\/p><p>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.<\/p><p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools. However, I believe that it is desirable to give schools discretion on how to use those increased resources. <\/p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. <\/p><p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students.  NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools.  Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.<\/p><p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. <\/p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on &quot;wellbeing&quot; being studied by all pupils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600096#WRTT01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":2078,"qnumday":857,"qnumall":"[20241\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600096#WRTT01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost of re-instating the previous policy on allocation of guidance counsellors to schools on a basis of one per 500 students; the cost of introducing this policy for non fee-paying schools only; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2079,"content":"<p>Since September 2012 guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the standard staffing schedule allocation.

","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2093,"content":"<p>Teacher allocations to all schools are approved annually by my Department in  accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  The  criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements  annually and are available on the Department website.<\/p><p>At post primary level and in addition to teacher allocations based largely on  pupil teacher ratios, an ex-quota allocation of one teaching post is also  allocated to Island schools. In accordance with the published staffing  arrangements each school management authority is required to organise its  subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The  deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and  ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a  matter for the school management authorities. <\/p><p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a  school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within  its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional  short term support i.e., curricular concessions.  Short term support is needed  (normally for one year but not exceeding 2\/3 school years) to enable the school  authority to respond to the identified difficulty in meeting essential  curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation. <\/p><p>  The detail of the curricular concession process is set out with the criteria  for the allocation of posts and is also available on the website. <\/p><p>  At primary level the staffing arrangements for the 2015\/16 school year are set  out in Department Circular 0005\/2015 which is available on my Department's  website at www.education.gov.ie.  Section 1 of the Circular sets out the  retention arrangements for Island Schools in the event that a reduction in the  pupil numbers of an island school will result in the loss of the second or  third classroom teaching post and where the school is the only primary school  remaining on the island. <\/p><p>  The circular also sets out the improvements to the staffing schedule for the  2015\/16 school year for small schools. These improvements are improved  retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the  improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools.  <\/p><p>  The allocation processes also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools  can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The  appeal procedures are also set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The  Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is  final. <\/p><p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return  to a position where we are seeing economic growth.  It is a continuing  improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us  to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher  resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class  size and support for classroom teachers. <\/p><p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated  resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes. <\/p><p>  My Department launched its &quot;Policy Proposals for Educational Provision in  Gaeltacht areas&quot; on 5 May, 2015.  The proposals aim to strengthen Irish-medium  provision in Gaeltacht schools. They include a range of policy options and  measures that could potentially address the challenges facing Gaeltacht  schools. Interested parties have been invited to provide their views in  relation to the policy options set out in the document.  This will be done  through a survey and responses are requested by 15 June 2015.  It is hoped that  organisations and individuals in the Gaeltacht and with an interest in  Gaeltacht education will respond to the survey.  It is also intended to meet  with stakeholder groups during the consultation process.  It is expected that  there will be a forum in the autumn where the findings of the consultation will  be considered. <\/p><p>  Such responses will inform the development of a Gaeltacht Education Policy.

A further step forward was the publication yesterday of Department Circular 0033\/2015 which updates and simplifies the manner in which primary schools can maintain pupil enrolment and attendance records following the introduction of the primary online database.<\/p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector.<\/p>  <p>  They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.<\/p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600098#WRVV04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":2183,"qnumday":894,"qnumall":"[20579\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600098#WRVV04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost of reducing the threshold for administrative principals to 145 pupils.

When state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period. <\/p><p>  As a result of negotiations in the late 1990's on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease.  The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property.  Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. <\/p><p>  The Deed of Variation refers to a change in the terms of a charging lease or Declaration of Trust. With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. <\/p><p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. <\/p><p>  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. <\/p><p>  The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent. <\/p><p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. <\/p><p>  The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600099#WRWW03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Tuition Scheme","counter":2232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600099#WRWW03050"},{"type":"question","counter":2233,"qnumday":911,"qnumall":"[20824\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600099#WRWW03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 188 of 14 May 2015 regarding a home tuition scheme, the reason her Department did not offer a similar arrangement to the parents whose children attended the service provider Achieve ABA, a charity established by parents who in April 2011 submitted a proposal to her Department, wherein section 9 of that proposal, Achieve ABA requested that the home tuition grant be paid directly to them; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2234,"content":"<p>The proposal referred to by the Deputy was submitted to my Department to fund an Academy for Children with Autism for children aged 4 &ndash; 14 as an alternative to State funded placements in State funded schools.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed Charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.<\/p>  <p>  Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.  The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities.  If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.  As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen; the legislation does not provide for further penalties to apply after this date.   <\/p>  <p>  As the NPPR charge is based on self-declaration and the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment, it is not possible to state with any certainty the level of non-compliance with the Charge.  Section 11 of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 provides for the exchange of data between local authorities and certain bodies defined in the Act, being the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Electricity Supply Board, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social Protection and any other person prescribed for the purpose under the section.  I am confident that compliance levels are high as a result of data matching undertaken with other public bodies as provided for in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The 2009 Act, as amended, places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority; my Department has no role in relation to enforcement of the Charge.  The data requested in relation to the numbers of notices issued by local authorities, the potential liability for the Charge related to those notices, the numbers of persons who availed of the grace period, the numbers of certificates of certificates of discharge issued by local authorities and the numbers of payment plans entered into is therefore not available in my Department.  The Local Government Management Agency coordinates certain matters relating to the NPPR, acting on an agency basis on behalf of the local government sector.<\/p>  <p>  According to data provided by the Local Government Management Agency, NPPR payments in excess of &euro;40 million were collected by local authorities in the grace period 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014.

The existing compulsory muzzling of the 12 then-restricted breeds should be retained, except for Pit Bull Terrier and Japanese Tosa.<\/p>  <p>  The view of the IVA was that dogs of the Pit Bull Terrier, Dogo Argentina, Japanese Tosa and Filo Brasilia breeds should be subject to a continued requirement for muzzling and lead control in public areas, that further importation of these dogs should be banned and that those already in the country should be neutered.<\/p>  <p>  The ISPCA, while having reservations in relation to muzzling all dogs of a particular breed, understood the Minister&rsquo;s first duty is to ensure as far as possible that the general public is protected from unnecessary risk.  They reluctantly agreed to muzzling and maintenance on a lead in a public place of all American Pit Bull Terriers and all internationally known fighting dogs.<\/p>  <p>  The IKC rejected the concept of muzzling dogs by reason of their breed.<\/p>  <p>  The ISPCA was consulted in 1998 in relation to a number of matters and expressed reservations about muzzling generally as they felt it could lead to behavioural problems in dogs, and that muzzling (but not leashing) should be relaxed as a first step in the case of the Bulldog, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and English Bull Terrier.  The ISPCA considered all dogs should be on a leash in a public place as many dog owners were incapable of keeping their dogs under effectual control.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure as far as possible that the general public would be protected from unnecessary risk, the compulsory provision of muzzling and leashing in public was retained in the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 for the following breeds: American Pit Bull Terrier, English Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Bull Mastiff, Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd (Alsatian), Rhodesian Ridgeback, Rottweiler, Japanese Akita, Japanese Tosa, Bandog and strains and crosses of these breeds.<\/p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs (Restriction of Certain Breeds) Regulations 1991, repealed by the 1998 Regulations, also included the Bulldog on the list of restricted breeds.  The Bulldog was not included on the list of restricted breeds in the 1998 Regulations on advice that the breed is physically unsuitable for muzzling and is not considered to present the degree of risk posed by the other breeds of dogs.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 542, 543 and 559 on 6 May 2015 in relation to the reasons why I have no plans to amend the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 2010 in respect of these matters.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these specific control requirements for the listed breeds are a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, respects animal welfare to the extent possible, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury, or cause death.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600101#WRYY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Development Contributions","counter":2295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600101#WRYY01500"},{"type":"question","counter":2296,"qnumday":936,"qnumall":"[19977\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600101#WRYY01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the counties that have reviewed their development levy schemes on foot of the guidance issued by his Department; if local authorities have acted promptly and with due regard to the guidance issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2297,"content":"<p>As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.

The scheme targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that similar mortgage arrears distress was being experienced by people with mortgages borrowed from local authorities and recognising the scale of the problem, the Government piloted a Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme in Dublin City and Westmeath County Councils in 2013.  The LAMTR Scheme was rolled out nationally in February 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The LAMTR scheme allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.  This enables families to stay in their home and their established community.  Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil.  Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.  My Department is keeping the operation of the LAMTR scheme under constant review.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department received and approved a total of 18 claims under the pilot LAMTR scheme. In 2014, 63 claims were received and approved.  To date in 2015, six claims have been received and will be processed shortly.  In total, my Department has paid &euro;7.971m in respect of 81 claims.  A 2015 budget allocation of &euro;10m is available for Mortgage to Rent, including both the LAMTR and private MTR schemes.  Both Mortgage to Rent schemes are demand led and offered, as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, where it is considered the most appropriate resolution, from a range of possible resolutions, for householders with unsustainable mortgages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600101#WRYY03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":2313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600101#WRYY03300"},{"type":"question","counter":2314,"qnumday":942,"qnumall":"[19998\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600101#WRYY03400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he is precluded, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, from exercising power or control over property within the ownership of Monaghan County Council, in view of the fact that the Council is also the local planning authority;

I am currently in the process of developing a new Energy Policy Paper which will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy out to 2030.  The Public Service Obligation (PSO), and the levy associated with it, are matters for consideration, along with many others, in the context of developing the forthcoming policy document.  However, given the total amount of the PSO has to be recovered by the levy, it should be noted that changes to it which would have the effect of reducing the amount paid by some users, as proposed in the paper submitted by the Deputy, would result in some, or all, other users paying more.  This is acknowledged in the paper.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO levy has been in place since 2001 and is the overall support mechanism for generation constructed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation, and for the development of renewable electricity.  It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. No. 217 of 2002).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2014\/2015 is &euro;335.4 million. This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20\/kVA for medium and large customers.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since mid-2013.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, it will reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay. In turn, suppliers should be in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. I note increased competition in the retail electricity sector recently which should help offset some of the PSO increase. The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600104#WRBBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":2441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600104#WRBBB01050"},{"type":"question","counter":2442,"qnumday":987,"qnumall":"[19927\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052600104#WRBBB01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when fibre broadband will be rolled out to an area (details supplied) in County Cork; and when local residents in this area will be able to access the Internet through a high-speed broadband connection.","asker":"996","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":2443,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.

The DHDA is now undertaking the fit-out of the building to office standard, with a view to the first tenants occupying the building this autumn. This expansion in its office capacity will allow the DHDA to continue to grow its enterprise cluster, while contributing to the economic sustainability and regeneration of the Liberties area.<\/p>  <p>  The arrangement will also see KSH develop high quality student accommodation on an acre site, formerly part of the Digital Hub campus.
