In the centenary commemorative programme, this year marks the passing of legislation for Irish Home Rule. Building on the work of Charles Stewart Parnell and the Land League, John Redmond and his party finally delivered the Home Rule Act. This was passed on the eve of the Great War and incomplete in its final form, with some vital issues unresolved. It was, of course, soon overtaken by events.   It is right that we acknowledge the work of Irish parliamentarians in keeping the cause of self-determination alive and sustaining hope through some of the darkest periods of our history. It is appropriate that John Redmond's leadership is being remembered with a series of events, exhibitions and lectures to take place this year in Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, Dublin and London. It is to be noted particularly that the restoration of John Redmond's vault in Wexford is being addressed in the context of the centenary commemorative programme.<\/p><p>In the context of the recognition of the place of John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party, the Deputy may be aware of the significant event held to mark the centenary of the Home Rule Act, hosted in the Irish Embassy in London on 1   July last. I understand a lively debate took place about the Home Rule Act, alternative possibilities, the evolution of Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism, and subsequent developments. The distinguished panel of guest speakers comprised former Taoiseach John Bruton, Lord Paul Bew, Professor Michael Laffan and Professor Richard Toye, while the audience included a range of Westminster parliamentarians, academics, community, business and cultural representatives, officials, advisers and media.<\/p><p>BBC Parliament filmed the debate and it was broadcast on 5   July last.

together.<\/p><p>  I refer to my reply to Question 158 (31024\/14) on the same subject yesterday, which was as follows:<\/p><p>  &ldquo;Following the dreadful murders of four young people in June and July, Israeli security forces detained six Israeli citizens in connection with the murder of the Palestinian youth; three of these are still in custody and are expected to be charged shortly.  Israel stated that a Hamas unit in Hebron had abducted and murdered the three Israeli youths, and arrested large numbers of Hamas operatives in the West Bank, both before and after the youths were found to have been killed. Israeli military forces also struck a number of Hamas targets in Gaza.<\/p><p>  This situation has quickly escalated, and the current large scale violence around Gaza, while originating in these incidents, has taken on a terrible life of its own. An estimated 800 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and West Jerusalem, and at the nuclear reactor at Dimona. Israel in response has carried out some 1300 air strikes on Gaza. While these are stated to be aimed at missile launchers and other targets associated with Hamas and other militant groups, as is always the case the resultant casualties, now estimated at approximately 190 dead in Gaza, include large numbers of civilians.<\/p><p>  Israel has stated that it seeks what it calls &ldquo;quiet for quiet&rdquo;, that is, a resumption of the truce which has largely held since November 2012. The attitude of Hamas is less clear, but it seems uninterested for the moment in a ceasefire. It may be that, have been weakened in a number of ways in recent months, it is seeking to reassert its standing in a military confrontation with Israel.<\/p><p>  It is however the ordinary people, especially of Gaza but also of Israel, who suffer the cost of these events.<\/p><p>  Our position is clear. This violence &ndash; in both directions &ndash; is not acceptable. Since taking office I have repeated the clear call of my predecessor for an end to firing by both sides, and a restoration of the truce. All Israelis, and all Palestinians, have the right to live in peace and security without this constant threat of violence. I welcome the proposal by the Government of Egypt providing for an early ceasefire to come into effect, and note the statement by Israel that it would accept this proposal. I very much hope this initiative will succeed.<\/p><p>  High Representative Ashton has made similar calls on behalf of the EU, as have many of my EU colleagues. Foreign Minister Steinmeier of Germany and Foreign Minister Mogherini of Italy are due to visit the region in the coming days for discussions with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.   It is expected that the situation will be considered by EU Heads of State and Government at their meeting on Wednesday 16 July.  The Foreign Affairs Council on 22 July was already scheduled to discuss the Middle East Peace Process and will certainly now consider this upsurge in violence.  This represents yet another cost of these events &ndash; a discussion which is intended to focus on the longer term political imperatives may now instead be dominated, as so often in the past, by the latest outbreak of cyclical and essentially futile violence. &ldquo;<\/p><p>  Further to that reply, my predecessor spoke directly to the Israeli and Palestinian Ambassadors on Thursday last, 10 July, and asked them to convey urgently to their authorities our great concerns about the situation and our call for urgent restraint and de-escalation of the crisis, full respect for international humanitarian law and a restoration of the ceasefire. <\/p><p>  I was very encouraged by the proposal of the Government of Egypt for a ceasefire to come into effect yesterday, and by the acceptance of this proposal by Israel, which then halted its military operations for a number of hours. Regrettably, missile attacks from Gaza into Israel did not cease, and attacks in both directions are now continuing. There is no indication as yet that Hamas are disposed to accept a ceasefire. I nonetheless hope that the Egyptian Government will persevere, and that it will be possible to achieve a ceasefire very soon.<\/p><p>  The European Convention on Human Rights applies only to Council of Europe member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600071#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600071#WRD01450"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[31992\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600071#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has put forward any particular proposals at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on the need to resume the EU-Iran human rights dialogue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>While the main focus in recent years has been on the critical nuclear issue, Ireland and our EU partners have continued to highlight our concerns at human rights issues in Iran, and we will continue to do so. The possibility of resuming a direct discussion with Iran on this important area would be very welcome.The new Iranian government which took office last year has made a number of statements of an intention to improve protection of human rights. This has included the suggestion to some EU interlocutors, including my predecessor Deputy Gilmore, that Iran might be interested in reopening the EU\/Iran Human Rights Dialogue, which it effectively ended in 2004. The then T&aacute;naiste and Minister warmly encouraged this idea, and advised our EU partners of the exchange. EU Foreign Ministers have generally welcomed and been open to this idea.   For the moment, however, Iran has not taken the proposal any further. It may well be that with the Iranian authorities fully engaged just now in very sensitive and difficult negotiations on the nuclear issue, they are not yet ready to take up this issue.<\/p><p>  Like the nuclear issue, the resumption of the dialogue would be a sensitive issue in Iran, and powerful elements within the regime may well oppose the government on it.

It called for the nationwide launch of a Basic Payment Account as a first step in promoting Financial Inclusion. A pilot project for a Basic Bank Account was run as one of the tasks required under the strategy.<\/p><p>  The pilot objectives were to launch a Basic Payment Account product, test the response to it and reaction of the target customers and use that experience to inform the national roll-out. The Basic Payment Account was re-branded as the Standard Bank Account to counter fears of stigmatising users of the product.<\/p><p>  The Standard Bank Account pilot project finished on 31 March 2013 after a 9-month pilot period. A total of 205 accounts were opened during the Pilot, which the Financial Inclusion Working Group (FIWG)\u00a0felt was disappointing. The report on the Standard Bank Account pilot project dated June 2013 and updated in November 2013 was published on my Department's website on 10 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The Report of the Working Group on the Pilot project noted the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a Standard Bank Account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions.\u00a0 This was seen as necessary to have the best possible channel for reaching the target cohorts. The Report also noted that barriers of existing infrastructure such as access to the clearing system had prohibited their more extensive involvement to date.<\/p><p>  Following the pilot phase, my Department engaged in a series of bilateral discussions with the stakeholders in order to best determine next steps.  However, in the course of discussions with An Post - which has the widest branch network -\u00a0 it became clear that one of the main issues in securing their effective involvement related to the cost to An Post of providing the bank account. This issue is currently being examined by my Department. I understand that some of the larger credit unions will be in a position to offer the account to customers in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600072#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Loans","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600073#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[31926\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600073#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the value and number of commercial loan books that remain at Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and the value of the commercial loan books sold at IBRC.

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. It includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. In addition, a staffing appeals process is available to schools, including a new criterion for 2014\/15 aimed at schools which make a significant contribution to absorbing demographic growth. The staffing arrangements, including detail of the appeals process, are set out in Circular 0007\/2014 which is available on the Department website.<\/p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for consideration by the Primary Staffing Appeals Board at its June 2014 meeting.

These properties include many iconic locations such as the Rock of Cashel or Newgrange which are known both nationally and internationally and attract large numbers of visitors, both domestic and foreign.  Approximately 70 of these sites are presented to visitors with guided services, either fulltime or seasonally, and these places form a significant part of the offering in the growing cultural and heritage tourism sector.  Apart from guided locations, there are also a large number of other sites in the portfolio which, while they are in State care, do not have guide services provided, although they are perhaps themselves very well known and attract significant numbers of visitors in their own right.  Properties in this category would include locations such as the Phoenix Park, St. Stephens Green and the Garden of Remembrance to give three examples.  The number of visitors to OPW managed sites is quite significant; approximately 4.2 million visitors were recorded in 2013 to guided sites and, given that many of these visitors are paying for admission, it is clear that this represents a significant element of commercial tourism activity.  The figure attending all OPW managed sites is more difficult to quantify, since the vast majority are unattended and therefore accurate numbers are not recorded, but it is reasonable to suggest that the total number is in excess of 15 million annually.<\/p><p>The following are currently the twenty most popular Heritage sites ranked in order of their recorded attendance figures in 2013:<table><tr><th>Site Name<\/th><th>Attendance Figures<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>National Botanic Gardens<\/td><td>550,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farmleigh Estate<\/td><td>435,476<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilmainham Gaol<\/td><td>326,205<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rock of Cashel<\/td><td>255,338<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castletown House &amp;amp; Parklands<\/td><td>244,416<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny Castle<\/td><td>241,302<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clonmacnoise<\/td><td>139,394<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Phoenix Park Visitor Centre<\/td><td>137,755<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newgrange<\/td><td>133,616<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Aonghasa<\/td><td>105,539<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin Castle<\/td><td>103,307<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>J F Kennedy Arboretum<\/td><td>95,841<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Glendalough Visitor Centre<\/td><td>80,922<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ross Castle<\/td><td>77,154<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Charles Fort<\/td><td>69,265<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cahir Castle<\/td><td>67,713<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Battle of the Boyne<\/td><td>60,702<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Altamont House and Gardens<\/td><td>53,541<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Knowth<\/td><td>51,138<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Garnish Island<\/td><td>49,706<\/td><\/tr><\/table>The strategy in relation to the promotion and marketing of sites is not an entirely commercial proposition and needs to be nuanced according to the needs of each site, particularly having regard to the particular conservation demands that must be accommodated.  Thus, for example, while Newgrange is obviously a World Heritage Site with an International profile and is very popular with visitors, it clearly has limits in terms of what can be sustainably and physically accommodated.  The visitor management strategy therefore is focused on diverting people to other satellite sites locally such as Knowth, Dowth, Mellifont, Trim Castle etc.  This illustrates a key policy of the OPW which is conservation led and operates on the principle that the heritage must be valued and protected first and foremost while still remaining encouraging and accommodating to visitors.  This approach fits well with the strategy of addressing in particular the educational dimension and OPW is active in terms of, for example, providing free schools access and supporting the education system message of the importance of our history and cherishing the past.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the primacy of the conservation and education ethos, it is nevertheless clear that the exploitation of heritage sites from a tourism point of view is very important.  Recent research has indicated the significance of the cultural and heritage tourism sector and OPW is actively engaging with Failte Ireland in relation to the promotion of our heritage sector with regard to key OPW managed sites in particular.  While the sites referenced in the top 20 table provided above are clearly important in this regard, there are some significant capacity constraints evident at certain locations and there is potentially better scope for visitor growth in the next tier of sites, which are currently attracting visitors in the range of approximately 10,000 - 40,000 annually.  These sites are less well known but still  include many historically important and valuable sites such as Donegal Castle, Ceide Fields, etc.<\/p><p>While the greater attention and focus will inevitably centre on sites with greater footfall and premium services available to visitors, there is also considerable attraction for many visitors in the large number of unattended\/unguided sites which have been referred to above.  There are possibilities for tourism development in these locations and this remains a significant part of Ireland's tourism offering.  The marketing and promotion of these locations will, in large part, entail the provision of better information about the sites and this is being addressed by both the OPW and its partner heritage agency, the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Promotion of these sites will however depend on issues such as provision of better road signage and wayfinding facilities.  Recent developments such as the Wild Atlantic Way initiative will help greatly in this regard and will assist in opening up many more sites of interest to independent travellers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[31789\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"in relation to the panel for clerical officers in the public service established in 2007-08, the number of persons employed from this panel on a region basis and in particular the numbers that were employed in the Carlow-Kilkenny area and the Laois-Offaly-Westmeath area and the numbers of persons with disabilities who were on this panel and were employed overall and in each region with particular reference to the Carlow-Kilkenny and the Laois-Offaly-Westmeath region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, precise figures for numbers and locations are not yet available given that Departments will make future staffing decisions in the context of Employment Control Frameworks (ECF) and budgetary allocations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Applications","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[31837\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on progress on the flood relief plans for Skibbereen, County Cork; the timetable for the completion of this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[31838\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on progress on the flood relief plans for Bandon, County Cork; the timetable for the completion of this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the proposed flood relief scheme for Skibbereen the position is that the detailed design of the Scheme is nearing completion.  The first stage of the procurement process for a civil works contractor to undertake the works has been commenced by Cork County Council, which is the Contracting Authority for the Scheme.  Tender documents are likely to be issued to a short listed number of contractors in early August with a contractor expected to be appointed in late 2014, subject to Confirmation of the Scheme i.e. formal approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts.<\/p><p>  In relation to Bandon, detailed design of the flood relief scheme is now almost completed.  The first stage of the procurement process for a civil works contractor was commenced in November 2013. However, following a legal challenge the OPW terminated the process.  The OPW will recommence the pre-qualification process very shortly.  The effect of having to re-run the process has meant that construction works are now expected to commence in the first quarter of 2015 rather than the previously anticipated start time of September 2014.  However, the delay in starting the works does not affect the completion date of the Scheme, which will still be programmed for completion towards the end of 2016.  The reason for this is that the Scheme requires two summer seasons of channel works due to environmental constraints, and the scheme programme provides that works would take place in the summers of 2015 and 2016.  The commencement of construction will of course, be dependent upon Confirmation of the Scheme. Construction of each of the schemes is likely to take 18&ndash;24 months to complete.  The OPW has provided for the cost of the schemes in its multi-annual budget profiles for the period 2014-2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[31865\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600076#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 80 of 14 November 2013, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the option of further review is not published in the section 15 and 16 freedom of information manual of the Commission for Public Service Appointments nor are details to be found on its website; if he or the commission has plans to publish the existence of this review process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p><font color=\"#222222\">The Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) is an independent statutory body and as such I have no role in the setting of its review procedures.

Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority is required, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures and to include in that record every structure which is, in the opinion of the planning authority, of such interest within its functional area. This may be done at the time of the preparation of the development plan or, where appropriate, at any other time.<\/p><p>  Section 53(1) of the 2000 Act enables the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion of specific structures in its Record of Protected Structures. A planning authority must have regard to any such recommendations. Ministerial recommendations are generally based on National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) surveys undertaken by my Department of the post-1700 built heritage of the country. Such a survey for Dublin City and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is currently underway. However, as the NIAH has not yet undertaken any fieldwork in Ringsend, no Ministerial recommendation has been made regarding the structures in question. The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities and in this case is ultimately a matter for Dublin City Council.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.

The latest F&aacute;ilte Ireland figures show that over 3.7 million overseas visitors engaged in cultural or historical visits while in Ireland in 2013.  Over 2.4 million tourists visited historic houses or castles, while over 1.5 million visited our archaeological monuments.

The three REFIT schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources to allow Ireland achieve its target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. <\/p><p>The cost of the PSO varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including the wholesale market price of electricity and the estimates for how much subsidy is funded by way of the PSO levy for each year are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The proposed PSO levy amount for the levy period from October 2014 to September 2015 has been calculated by the CER and a draft decision (CER\/14\/125) is on its website.  The cost to the PSO of REFIT for the period is estimated to be &euro;84,346,555.  While the bulk of subsidies for renewable electricity generation paid under the REFIT schemes have been for wind, the CER has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date for each technology supported.

Responsibility for the regulation of these markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.<\/p><p>  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by the lower international gas prices since spring 2014.  This should reduce the wholesale cost of gas and electricity that suppliers pay and, in turn, enable those suppliers to reduce their retail prices.  However, falling wholesale gas prices will have to be sustained over a long period to result in lower electricity prices, if at all. This is because of a number of factors, including supplier market strategies in hedging and price setting and the network tariff outlook for 2014\/2015.<\/p><p>  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density, resulting in higher network costs.

In 2013, the Housing Agency was asked to conduct a standalone review of the Shared Ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures.  While an initial draft of the review has been received from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis.  For example, full information on the status of each local authority&rsquo;s loan book is required in order to accurately determine the implications of any possible solutions to shared ownership issues for local authority debt management generally.\u00a0 This substantial data collection project involving my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the local authorities themselves is under way.  It will be a number of months before sufficient data have been collected in order to complete the requisite analysis to finalise the review.  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders.  It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review. <\/p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, among others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity.  In such cases borrowers should proactively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages. <\/p><p>The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities.  In cases of acute mortgage distress, homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now in place to deal with personal insolvency. <\/p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012.  This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an Approved Housing Body and the family becomes a tenant of the body concerned.  Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.  This   Mortgage to Rent scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears, which was piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, was rolled out nationally in February 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600083#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage to Rent Scheme Applications","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600083#WRQ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[31796\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600083#WRQ02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding a mortgage to rent case in respect of persons (details supplied) which is currently awaiting approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>An application for provisional approval in this case was received by my Department on 9   June 2014 and this provisional approval was granted the following day. <\/p><p>My Department is awaiting a further submission for full funding approval once an appropriate approved housing body has been identified by the Housing Agency and the proposal progresses to that stage.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600083#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":449,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 170  and 171 answered with Question No. 166.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600084#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[31875\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600084#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide information on Leader funding (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>In line with the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach to rural development, there are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, to deliver the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) throughout the country.  The LAGs are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  <i>In compliance with a European Court of Justice judgment, my Department hasn&rsquo;t been able to publish information in relation to personal beneficiaries under the LEADER programme and so only publishes details of payments to the Local Action Groups that administer the Programme. However, agreement has now been reached at EU level which will allow details to be published for the previous financial year.  Therefore <\/i>payments in respect of the 2014 EU financial year will be published in May 2015.<\/p><p>The following table details the level of project expenditure to date for each Local Action Group under the RDP from 2009 to June 2014.  In the context of the next EU programming period 2014-2020 the continuation of the LEADER approach in rural areas is critical for the future development of rural Ireland.  In this context it is the responsibility of my Department to ensure that all funding allocated under the LEADER elements of the RDP is compliant with the regulatory framework and is expended on the basis of sound financial management practices.  My Department is currently working on developing the systems required to ensure that the funding is allocated and spent in the most effective way at a local level for the 2014-2020 period.<\/p><p>As outlined in the draft Rural Development Programme, which has been submitted to the European Commission and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at it is intended that there will be a two-step Local Action Group selection process that will ensure that all entities interested in delivering a Local Development Strategy have the required capacity to do so.  Once the strategy is in place, successful delivery entities will be required to put in place a series of systems outlined by my Department to support their effective and efficient delivery of the LEADER element of the RDP.  These systems will include effective decision making practices to ensure that funding is targeted to maximise its impact.  Transparent governance arrangements, sound financial management practices and comprehensive appeals mechanisms will also be required in order to support the efficient and effective delivery of LEADER interventions.  These systems will be subject to on-going monitoring by my Department and other entities, including audit authorities, to ensure compliance.  I intend that appropriate comprehensive management systems will be put in place to support the delivery of the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020 in a manner that targeted, cost effective and efficient use of funding, maximising the benefit for rural communities.<\/p><p><b>Table<\/b><table><tr><th><div>Local Action Group <\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Projects 2009 <\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Projects 2010 <\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Projects 2011 <\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Projects 2012 <\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Projects 2013 <\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Projects 2014 to 30th June 2014 <\/div><\/th><th><div>Total Project spend for 2009 -2014 <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Avondhu\/ Blackwater Partnership Limited <\/td><td><div>&euro;304,200 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,025,095 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,152,332 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;904,082 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;940,234 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;199,006 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;4,524,950 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ballyhoura Development Limited <\/td><td><div>&euro;346,850 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,334,148 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,654,101 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,805,196 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,517,328 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,375,370 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;10,032,994 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow County Development Partnership <\/td><td><div>&euro;169,933 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;915,488 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,005,953 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;601,963 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;936,687 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;577,911 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;4,207,935 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan\/ Monaghan Area Partnership Ltd. <\/td><td><div>&euro;0 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;741,389 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;978,859 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,229,963 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2,774,855 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;910,850 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;6,635,917 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare Local Development Company <\/td><td><div>&euro;365,882 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,121,263 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,692,960 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,808,750 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2,760,012 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,790,288 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;9,539,155 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Comhar na nOile&aacute;n Teoranta <\/td><td><div>&euro;55,480 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;490,002 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;325,191 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;877,043 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,816,567 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;629,119 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;4,193,403 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal Local Development Company Limited <\/td><td><div>&euro;235,832 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;722,485 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,381,228 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2,002,820 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,001,084 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,434,973 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;8,778,421 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal LEADER Partnership <\/td><td><div>&euro;28,744 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;250,813 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;249,778 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;222,881 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;558,461 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;268,457 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,579,135 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FORUM Connemara <\/td><td><div>&euro;27,726 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;473,782 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;308,478 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;998,204 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;705,214 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;308,004 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2,821,407 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Rural Development Company Limited <\/td><td><div>&euro;428,761 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,118,616 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,367,608 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,587,409 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,997,450 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;608,051 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;7,107,895 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Inishowen Development Partnership <\/td><td><div>&euro;273,649 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;575,034 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;891,214 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,363,310 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2,077,104 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;339,806 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;5,520,118 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>I.R.D.

Mindful of this, I have decided to target specific support for island farmers via a new top-up to be introduced under the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme. This additional payment will commence in 2015 with the introduction of the ANC Scheme, which is currently known as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. The proposed top-up rates are &euro;150 per forage hectare where a farmer is an island resident and &euro;75 per forage hectare where a farmer is not resident on an island and is actively farming the island lands. My Department is currently in the process of identifying and investigating all islands situated both offshore and inland on lakes and rivers, and determining the eligibility of each. Following initial analysis, it has been considered that islands connected to the main land by permanent access route will not incur the same costs as farmers living and farming on the islands and therefore will not be eligible. These proposals weresubmitted to the Commission on 3<sup>rd<\/sup>July 2014, as part of the overall Rural Development Programme, with approval anticipated later this year.It is opportune, however, to take the opportunity to outline the position regarding the ongoing review of the data contained on my Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) database.<\/p><p>Under the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications and are required to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc. These claims are then recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.<\/p><p>Following consultation with the EU Commission in 2013 , as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included. In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to establishments of over-payments.<\/p><p>The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted of a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, which was declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes. In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes.<\/p><p>A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised. In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>Independent LPIS Appeals Committee<\/i>, chaired by Mr Padraig Gibbons. I would encourage any farmer , who considers that the level of deductions made in his or her case to be invalid, to submit an application for a review of the decision if he or she has not already done so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600085#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600085#WRS00750"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[31720\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600085#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the cost to his Department for determining, notifying the applicant and recouping a penalty under the agri-environment option scheme 3, and in cases were the penalty is less than the cost of finding and administering if he will consider writing off the penalty.","asker":"1058","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>My Department is the accredited paying agency with responsibility for the proper management and disbursement of European Union funds.

are subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, to be completed before payments can issue. These rigorous procedures, together with on-farm inspections, apply to a number of scheme payments including the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS), and are necessary to ensure that applications meet the scheme conditions and cross-compliance requirements.    In line with the governing Regulations, payments issue in two tranches, 75% payment and 25% payment. The administrative checks have been completed and 75% payments are well under way with payments issuing on a continuous basis until all payments are complete. It is anticipated that the balancing 25% payments will commence shortly, for all of those applicants whose files are in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600086#WRT00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600086#WRT00650"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[31996\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600086#WRT00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide in tabular form those Acts currently in force for which he has lead responsibility that have parts or sections yet to be formally commenced; the details or purpose of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>Since this Government took office my Department has published three Bills, all of which have been enacted:<\/p><p>- Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill (28 July 2011) <\/p><p>- Animal Health and Welfare Bill (25 April 2012) and <\/p><p>- Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Bill (15 May 2014)<\/p><p>Parts 5, 11 and 12 of the Animal Health &amp;amp; Welfare Act are not core to the operation of the Act and relate to stand alone schemes for Animal Health Levies, Animal Tracing Systems and Animal Marts respectively which allow for the existing schemes to be expanded in terms of coverage or modernised.

It provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances.

In effect, this means that the State carries the risk of services which may not be safe or which do not align with national policy goals. This system of enterprise liability is managed through the Clinical Indemnity Scheme. My Department is working with the HSE and the State Claims Agency (which operates the Clinical Indemnity Scheme) to ensure that the indemnity provided to services aligns with health systems policy. The Patient Safety Agency has not yet been established, but this does not hamper the development of the risk-based approach to the provision of indemnity. <\/p><p>  The first stage in this process is the development and operation of a new upgraded database system, developed by the State Claims Agency, which will capture information on adverse events.  The  National Adverse Event Management System (NAEMS) went live in 119 State authorities under the remit of the State Claims Agency on 16 June, 2014 and since that date all incidents from the HSE are held on the new upgraded system.  The system is being rolled out initially over the coming months, with training being provided to its users. <\/p><p>   Agreement will be reached by the end of 2014 between the State Claims Agency, the HSE's Patient Safety Directorate and my Department on the criteria for enabling this system to provide end to end adverse event management, root cause analysis and policy audit tools.

A key recommendation is that health service management and medical organisations should commence, as a matter of urgency, an industrial relations engagement of short duration to address the barrier caused by the variation in pay rates between new entrant Consultants and their established peers that have emerged since 2012. This issue has been identified as being important in the recruitment of consultants and in retaining doctors in training. Discussions involving the HSE, my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the IMO negotiations have commenced under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission. The third report, submitted on 30th June,  addresses issues relating to strategic medical workforce planning, and career planning and mentoring supports for trainee doctors.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The Working Group has offered solutions and recommendations that will enable us to build a sustainable medical workforce for the future. Processes are already in place in relation to implementing the recommendations of the December 2013 and April 2014 reports. My Department and the HSE will now work together to put the necessary arrangements in place in order to drive and oversee implementation of all the recommendations of the Strategic Review and assess their impact into the future.<\/p><p>Separately, as part of the implementation of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-16, the Department of Health, HSE and Irish Medical Organisation are collaborating on a series of initiatives to support graduate retention, including progression of EWTD compliance, agreement on the protection of training time and the implementation of time and attendance systems for NCHDs. Arrangements have recently been finalised allowing NCHD's to avail of career breaks to travel abroad for Specialist Training and to take up employment in the private sector as part of their training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600094#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Complaints Procedures","counter":736,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600094#WRBB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":737,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[31817\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600094#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to an article in The Sunday Times by Justine McCarthy dated, 25 May 2014, where it was noted that his Department said a certain contention (details supplied) was not correct, upon whose legal advice this was based, that is, the Attorney General, external legal advice or anyone else.

However, in an emergency admission if a private designated bed was not available and a private in-patient was accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge was not levied, although the private in-patient continued to pay the fees of his\/her hospital consultant.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimated in his 2010 Annual Report that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance in public hospitals because they were not occupying designated private beds.

However, it is the Data Protection Acts, based on the EU Data Protection Directive, which regulate the processing of personal data.  Those Acts are configured on the basis of control of the personal data concerned.   Accordingly, considerations concerning the collecting, use, sharing and disclosing of personal data and the anonymisation and pseudo-anonymisation of personal health data are necessarily shaped by the principles of data protection. One of those principles is that personal health data is to be regarded as sensitive personal data and therefore deserving of enhanced care by data controllers, particularly as regards security.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives in relation to health information in recent years with a view to improving the use of information and information technology in the health service.  Of particular relevance, for the future, is the eHealth strategy which was launched in December 2013.  A key element of that strategy is that access to the right information in the right place and at the right time is of paramount importance in underpinning patient care and progressing efficiency and effectiveness in the health delivery system.    <\/p><p>  In that regard, my predecessor also introduced the Health Identifiers Bill last December.  That Bill, which is now enacted, provides for a system of unique patient identifiers along with identifiers for healthcare organisations and health professionals.  This represents not only a major patient safety initiative in terms of ensuring correct identification at the point of care but it will also assist in ensuring that the patient&rsquo;s medical information will always be uniquely associated with his or her records throughout the health system thereby helping the delivery of speedier and better individual care.  The identifier system will also facilitate other desirable health reform initiatives such as money follows the patient.<\/p><p>  It is important to point out that the Data Protection Commissioner was consulted extensively on the Bill.  This was to ensure privacy considerations were fully addressed and reflected in the robust governance structure underpinning the Bill, including criminal sanctions for inappropriate use of the individual health identifier.<\/p><p>  I intend to bring forward a Health Information Bill to Government later this year.  The Bill will build on existing data protection legislation which already provides that personal health data collected and kept by data controllers has to be accurate and up to date and adequate, relevant and not excessive.  That will continue under the Health Information Bill.   Further, as a general principle, rules on the collecting, using and disclosing of personal data under the Data Protection Acts apply equally to data controllers in the private and public sectors and this will also continue to be the case under the Health Information Bill.  This includes any persons offering mobile health applications where those applications collect personal data.<\/p><p>  It is also envisaged that the Health Information Bill will contain a number of measures designed to enhance the processing of personal data for better patient care and safety at an individual level and the achievement of broader health service goals at a more general level.  In doing so, the Bill will seek to balance the benefits of moving towards a modern integrated health care system with due regard to the need to continue to value the privacy and confidentiality of patient information.  Such an approach is fundamental to maintaining public support for and confidence in a reforming health system.  For that reason, it is also intended that the Bill will expressly provide for an offence in relation to the buying and selling of patient identifiable information.  I know there have been recent concerns about this issue.<\/p><p>  Health research is, of course, very important to a modern health system and it is intended that the Bill will contain measures designed to promote health research in Ireland: most notably through the creation of a new streamlined national research ethics approval structure for health research not otherwise governed by EU or national law ethics structures. <\/p><p>  In all of the above, my Department has engaged extensively with a range of stakeholders in preparing the Health Identifiers Bill and the planned Health Information Bill: including, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p>  Consequently, I am of the view that the recent Health Identifiers Act and the forthcoming Health Information Bill along with the eHealth strategy can underpin a governance and development model that will promote public confidence in the increased use of information technology in the health sector and allow us to take advantage of the significant opportunities that such technology can offer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600095#WRCC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Equipment","counter":783,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600096#WRDD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":784,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[31948\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071600096#WRDD00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason there is no weekend availability of MRI scanners at Cork University Hospital;

This Government is committed to providing specialist disability supports to enable each individual with a disability including those with ASD, to achieve his or her full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups. <\/p><p>  Services provided by ASD &lsquo;Service Providers&rsquo; include assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment and intervention supports.  Ongoing interventions and supports may include home support services, respite services and multi-disciplinary team supports to assess the individual needs of each person with ASD and provide for the appropriate interventions. <\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA). This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, will be of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD. <\/p><p>  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, is working with schools, service providers, young people and their families to identify training needs and explore suitable options for school-leavers graduating in 2014. Many young people with disabilities will progress to further education or vocational training funded by the Department of Education and Skills. For those young people who will require ongoing HSE-funded supports, the HSE has established a National Oversight Group to coordinate a timely response to processing applications for day services and rehabilitative training (RT) places. <\/p><p>  The provision of a timely response to the requirement for training places and day services to young people with disabilities has proved challenging in recent years. This year, to meet the challenge, the HSE put in place a revised process to ensure a more streamlined approach to the assignment of places to around 1,400 school-leavers and RT graduates.  The HSE has confirmed that young people and their families were notified by the end of June of the placements that will be available to them from September. The HSE has allocated funding in excess of the &euro;7 million additional allocation provided in the HSE Social Care Operational Plan 2014 in order to achieve this.

Over 99% of GPs hold the 1989 capitation contract.  Both contract types contain provisions relating to retirement age.  Up until 1 October 2009, the Capitation contract provided that GPs who entered into contracts on the date of its commencement could hold the contract up to age 70 and that all subsequent GP contractors could hold the contract up to age 65.

Projections by the Centre show that income of approximately &euro;1.8m is anticipated during 2014.
