He did an excellent job and I have no doubt that bringing his knowledge and professionalism to his new role, he will perform excellently as Minister of State also.  I wish him well in Agriculture House with his colleagues and the new senior Minister there.<\/p><p>The issue I raise today relates to the sheep sector, with which the Minister of State will be very familiar coming from County Wicklow which has a large sheep population.  There is a large sheep population in the Republic and, in fact, there are more sheep than people living in it.  We are highly dependent on the sheep sector as part of the Food Wise 2025 strategy, agrifood exports and live exports.  It is an important part of the farm fabric, particularly in the west where the land is more marginal and sheep farmers struggle to make ends meet.  The margins in sheep farming tend to be low.  I was heartened by the commitment in the programme for Government of approximately &euro;25 million for a sheep premium scheme like the old headage scheme.  I welcome that.  The reason I table today's Commencement matter is to give the Minister of State an opportunity to outline what stage it is at.  Obviously, it will take a budgetary commitment in budget 2017, which will be later this year, to make provision for that.  How will the funding be ring-fenced?  Will it be a premium flat rate per ewe?  Without pre-empting any consultation, what is anticipated?<\/p><p>It is important to consult the sector.  While there the main farming organisations, there are also organisations which are newly established, such as the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, which have made a number of specific recommendations around young farmers and the equalisation of payments.  Is it envisaged that there will be consultation with organisations like that?  There are the larger farm organisations, with which it is also important to consult.  I call on the Minister of State to ensure that if a payment is made available, it does not discriminate against or in favour of lowland or upland.  There should be some form of flat rate payment.  As there are additional constraints on farming on marginal and hill land, will anything be brought into consideration in regard to that?  Will there be anything for younger farmers to ensure they are not precluded from obtaining the payment for all of their flocks, given some restriction?  They are issues that will be delved into as the year goes on.  Nevertheless, I have tabled the matter at this early stage to provide the Minister with the opportunity to ensure that a wide-ranging consultation takes place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#B00400","speaker":"1382","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This is the first opportunity I have had to address the Upper House.  I am delighted to do so on a subject in which I have some interest, indeed a vested interest as a flock owner.  I am very pleased also that a former colleague on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has raised the matter.  On the committee, we proved beyond doubt that it is possible to work constructively across party and non-party lines for the betterment of the sector.  I will set out the official reply which gives the broad outline.  In the follow up contribution, I can discuss the flat rate and so on.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government commits to the provision of &euro;25 million for the support of the sheep sector in budget 2017.  This provision recognises the commitment of the Government to the development of the sheepmeat sector which is an important element of the national economy.  The sector generated an output value of &euro;320 million and exports in excess of &euro;230 million in 2015.  The sector also makes a vital contribution to the economy by supporting 34,000 farm families directly as well as by providing several thousand jobs indirectly in rural areas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This commitment is also additional to the support provided through the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, through the areas of natural constraint scheme and through the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS.  The inclusion of a TAMS measure to support sheep fencing was recently announced.  This approval, which followed lengthy discussions between the Department and the European Commission, will provide a significant boost to sheep farmers, especially young farmers who wish to commence sheep production by providing them the means to invest significantly in the necessary infrastructure for their holdings.<\/p><p>The supports provided through these measures are a recognition of the critical importance of the sheep sector, which makes a vital contribution to the economic viability rural areas through farming, processing and marketing as well as playing a central role in shaping the landscape, both in more intensive farming areas and in areas where more marginal land dominates.  This scheme has the potential to deliver targeted support to an important sector of agriculture.  It is my objective that the scheme delivers a long-term cumulative benefit to the sheep sector.<\/p><p>Support from the Department for the vital work of Teagasc and Sheep Ireland is critically important.  Developing new and more lucrative markets is also a key challenge.  In this regard, my Department works to develop market opportunities by opening new markets and supports the work of Bord Bia in the promotion of sheepmeat in domestic and EU markets.  My Department has been engaged in consultations with farm bodies to inform its work on the detail of the new sheep scheme.  I took note of the Senator&rsquo;s point about the smaller representative organisations which have been in contact.  Any such scheme will have to be approved by the European Commission under the rural development programme.  It must meet the exacting requirements of the rural development regulations in compensating farmers for any actions undertaken on the basis of costs incurred or income foregone.<\/p><p>Furthermore, in any rural development scheme, actions taken by farmers must go beyond the normal standards of husbandry practice before they can be considered as an eligible cost incurred by a farmer.  The challenge will be to develop a simple and practical scheme which makes a real contribution to the development of the sector, while meeting all of the EU requirements.  There is also an obligation on us to ensure any scheme that provides for support to sheep farmers is targeted at improving on-farm practices which will have lasting and cumulative benefits to sheep farmers and the national flock.<\/p><p>I am also aware of the need to ensure the scheme is made available to as many sheep farmers as possible.  In that context, it is important that the different systems of production of both lowland sheep farmers and hill sheep farmers are taken into account in any such scheme.<\/p><p>On the basis of the engagement with farm bodies to date, there is a reasonable degree of consensus that article 33 of the rural development regulation, which provides for support for animal welfare measures, is the most appropriate vehicle for supporting the sector in this instance.  I am particularly anxious to ensure the scheme includes measures suitable for the differing production systems in both hill and lowland flocks.<\/p><p>At this stage, the Department has had an initial meeting with the European Commission and is working through the detail of the proposed scheme.  The examination of the proposals by the Commission will be forensic, focusing on ensuring compliance with the relevant regulations, additionality and value for money.  As a result of these discussions, departmental officials are working intensively on ensuring any scheme meets the requirements of the Commission.  It is expected there will be further ongoing and detailed communication with the Commission on the scheme&rsquo;s details.<\/p><p>The scheme will also have to be presented to the monitoring committee of Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme prior to final submission to the European Commission.  My focus is on delivering a scheme which can maximise the number of participants and deliver tangible benefits to the sheep sector in its impact as regards on-farm practices.  This scheme has the potential to deliver targeted support to an important sector of agriculture.  It is my objective to design and implement a scheme that delivers a long-term cumulative benefit to the sheep sector.  It is important the measures are tangible and give a real benefit while the scheme is kept simple as possible.  The &euro;25 million can cover a flat rate, if it is the preferred option, without having it either frontloaded or capped at &euro;200 or &euro;250 per head.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The budget allows for it to cover all breeding sheep in the system at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#C00200","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply and I agree with everything he said.

I know from experience that a lame animal does not put on flesh and, therefore, does not make a farmer money.  A simple measure can be taken to address that.  Fencing provides access to young farmers to the scheme because they may be starting out with an underdeveloped property or a green field site that was not used for sheep farming previously.

It is with disbelief that I raise the issue of delay in delivery of new rural group water schemes.  Counties Mayo and Galway are particularly affected.  When I was a Member of the Lower House, I had cause to raise this issue on numerous occasions and I had hoped I was making progress as I went along.  Notwithstanding that, 235 houses in far flung areas such as Aghaloonteen, Massbrook, Tonacrick, Kilmurry, Downpatrick, Fermoyle and Carracastle have a water supply that is not fit for human consumption or any other use.  These householders are crying out for assistance from the State.  They live in disadvantaged rural areas, which previously came under the CL&Aacute;R scheme that was abolished in 2010.  They had hoped to receive financial assistance under the scheme to help them with the construction of new group water schemes.  To date, unfortunately, nothing has happened.<\/p> <p>A commitment was given by the previous Government.  For several years, Mayo County Council received &euro;200,000 annually to progress some of the schemes.  The major problem is it costs a great deal per household to deliver a scheme because of the topography and ground conditions compared to an area where ground conditions are more friendly.  Last year, new rules were devised following much deliberation by the national rural group water committee and &euro;400,000 was allocated to Mayo County Council.  Not one red cent of the annual allocations has been spent.  Last year, the issue was supposed to have been resolved through a new process - the rural water multi-annual programme.  However, I recently learned that this issue, which comes under measure 3 of the rural water multi-annual programme, is before an expert panel again.  I also understand from the local authority that whereas in previous years it would have received funding by now under the rural water programme, it has only received a small portion this year, which is funding private companies on contracts to design, build and operate schemes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have not received all the other funding to help group water schemes cleanse water to ensure it is up to date - that is aside from new group water schemes, the category I am particularly concerned about.  The local authority needs to spend from an overdraft and does not have the funding.<\/p><p>The people have been let down.  Hard working committees in disadvantaged areas have gone out and collected money, not to pay for the water but to pay for the provision of pipe work and to retain consultants.  Those involved in these schemes have spent hundreds of thousands of euro and have not been reimbursed.<\/p><p>With domestic households on group water schemes paying directly to Mayo County Council, the problem now arises that other people are not paying for their water.  They are looking at what is happening nationally and the lack of delivery on the ground to households that are very willing to pay for their water.  They understand that pipes do not just appear in the ground and that getting quality water is not just a case of putting out a bucket and getting water from the sky.  These are practical people and have been greatly let down.  As somebody who has represented them, I feel very let down with the lack of action.<\/p><p>What is to happen now?  People are demoralised.  The water quality is very bad.  I am not talking about cryptosporidium or anything like that but about iron oxides through the water.  When the tap is turned on, what comes out is red; it is not possible to wash clothes in it.  Elderly people, people who are sick and people with children are affected by this.  With all the controversy over the chairman designate, Mr. Joe O'Toole, I wonder if anybody is thinking about these people.  Why is nobody marching on the streets for them?  This has been going on for years.<\/p><p>I understand we came through difficult economic times, but people were led to believe that something was being progressed and yet last year the water services section of Mayo County Council went through the motions - the council did not think it was going through the motions - with two schemes, Aghaloonteen and Massbrook, thinking they would be top of the list and that each year we would see progress.  However, nothing has happened.  All that work that was done last year has gone by the wayside.

It is clear that excellent work is done by group water schemes.  There has been pent-up demand for some years due to the lack of investment owing to economic circumstances.  Hopefully, we are in a better place now to try to tackle that and we hope to get that money out to them to be spent more quickly.<\/p> <p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I am well aware of the excellent work done by the group water scheme and the enormous commitment of local communities in setting up group water schemes.  There is a pent-up demand that needs to be addressed and we need to find ways to channel the money to them.<\/p> <p>Since 2000, my Department has, under its rural water programme, provided over &euro;810 million towards the capital costs of providing and improving group water schemes.  Financial assistance, in the form of subsidies, has also been provided towards the subsequent running and operational costs of these schemes in providing water for domestic use.  Nevertheless, further work is required and there is a need for continuing investment in the group water scheme sector so as to ensure that the drinking water provided complies with the standards set at both EU and national level.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that there are particular difficulties in setting up some new group water schemes where the financial viability of the scheme is questionable with schemes in the previous CL&Aacute;R-funded areas being a case in point.  Earlier this year, a new multiannual approach to the funding of group water schemes for 2016 and beyond under the rural water programme was introduced.  This will lead to the development of appropriate prioritised lists of schemes for funding both in 2016 and in future years.  One of the measures in this programme will support social and economic development, and living standards in towns and villages and their hinterlands by providing new group water schemes in areas where a public scheme and private wells are not a viable option.  This measure is aimed at providing assistance towards some of those schemes which Senator Mulherin mentioned.

The charities legislation has had an outrageous historical journey and this has been going on since the mid-1990s.  The Department of Justice and Equality sat on it for years, it next arrived at other Departments and it then came back to the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Bill has been around since the 2000s and has been a very long time in gestation.  It was passed nearly ten years ago but was not implemented.  I have always felt, certainly in the last five years when I was here in the Seanad, that when we enact legislation there is a presumption that once it appears on the Statute Book, it will at least become effective.  In this case, large and vital sections of the Bill remain inactive and important powers are denied.<\/p> <p>I do not want to go into the background of Console.  It is possibly the worst of all scandals because an organisation like Console murders hope in the people who placed such hope in this organisation.  Of course, it is the people at the head of it, not those who work in it, who murder that hope and abandon the sense of the humane in themselves.<\/p> <p>Recent scandals in the charity sector have been allowed to snowball because the essential legislative sections have been left uncommenced and under-resourced.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Part 4 is the most important one.

If one transfers, as we did, all the functions of the Attorney General to the Charities Regulatory Authority, one must also transfer all the machinery and powers.<\/p><p>The Minister intends to commence Part 4 in September, namely, the regulator's investigative powers to seize documents, enter premises, to suspend trustees and to have what we would call a full set of teeth when needed, so that reputational damage, like what happened with Console, will not occur again.  Will the Minister outline what additional resources she intends to put in place so that the regulator has all he needs?  Will the Minister indicate why Part 4 cannot be commenced before the recess?  Why must we wait until September since it is already there?  Why must we always wait for a massive problem to arise before we do something about it?  In more instances than one, it is too late.  It is too late for the greed of some, which we have witnessed, and for the fractured fragility of the victims.  Will the Minister please answer those questions?  The regulator needs the powers now as well as the additional resources.  What are those additional resources?

Needless to say I am deeply concerned by the recent revelations about Console.  I know that people rely heavily on its services and I am pleased that the HSE is ensuring a continuity of its services in the first instance.  It is essential, as the Senator said, that all organisations funded by the State are regulated and managed in an appropriate manner.  Likewise, all moneys donated by the public must be managed appropriately and in line with good corporate governance.  Anything less is a betrayal of the goodwill of thousands of people around the country and, indeed, of the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>I say betrayal because people's trust has been betrayed.  The unwritten agreement between the charity and the people that the people's money will be efficiently and appropriately used has been broken.  The betrayal also reaches to the collective trust charities place in one another to uphold good governance, standards and public confidence in the sector.  The details the Senator has outlined are particularly disturbing.<\/p> <p>For the Government's part, it is essential that we progress the regulatory reforms we proposed in recent years.  As Senators are aware, Part 4 of Charities Act 2009 deals specifically with the charity regulator's investigatory and enforcement functions.  Pending the commencement of Part 4, the regulator has put in place - I worked with him last year on this - an interim process for the handling of concerns received about suspected abuse of charitable status or fraud in charities.  However, having had discussions with the regulator and with my officials, I can confirm to the Senator that today I am signing the necessary statutory instrument to commence Part 4 to take effect from 5 September 2016.<\/p> <p>The Senator asked about the delay.  This commencement date is to allow for the recruitment over the coming weeks of the necessary staffing resources to support these important functions.  I am also examining the legislation to see if there is any other provision.  I think the Senator mentioned section 17.  I am examining that to see if it can be brought in quickly as well.<\/p> <p>The establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority was one of my priorities when I first became Minister for Justice and Equality.  Shortly after becoming Minister, it was established as an independent agency on 16 October 2014 under the provisions of the Charities Act.<\/p> <p>To go back on the history, the Senator is right that the Act was introduced by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  It provided for the regulator.  Its establishment was delayed because of the economic situation for quite a number of years.  However, the previous Government and I, as Minister, were determined to establish the regulator to restore confidence in the charity sector after a number of other controversies.  I wish to make the following point as it is very important we all appreciate this, as I am sure Senators do, but regulating a large, previously unregulated sector is a challenge.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The scale of the job, about which I will provide some facts, is not to be underestimated.  However, there has been significant progress.  As the Senator will be aware, the aim of the Charities Regulator is to provide for better regulation of charitable organisations through a framework of registration, regulation and support.  This is intended to enhance public confidence in the vast majority of charities that do immense and essential work.  The regulator has a wide range of functions which we could not introduce all at the same time.  It had to be done on a phased basis, beginning with the compilation of the new statutory register of charities.  That was a development of the regulator.  Some 8,000 charities were registered with the Revenue Commissioners and they were transferred to the Charities Regulator immediately once it started registering the authority.  In addition, any of the charities that had not registered with the Revenue Commissioners had to apply directly to the regulator.  Much time was spent last year encouraging charities to register and making sure that they did so.  The take-up was very slow at the beginning but another 1,500 applications came in following the work done by the regulator to make sure that charities registered.  It was necessary to register 3,600 schools that are also registered for charitable status.  A huge amount of work has, therefore, been done already.  Investigations cannot begin until registration is in place and until the charities around the country are known.  The regulator has developed an online system for organisations to apply for inclusion on the register of charities and for information to go out to the charity sector on its obligations and duties under the new regime.<br\/><br\/>The Senator will, therefore, recognise there is quite a bit of work to be done, given the number of charities in this country.  There are more than 12,500 charitable organisations.  The regulator has received approximately 300 concerns over 132 different entities, the majority of which are charities.  These concerns cover the entire scale, from issues to do with an organisation's purpose to the quality of service provided to a passing comment about somebody not agreeing with the goal of the charity.  Often, therefore, concerns raised with the Charities Regulator are matters to be pursued by other bodies as well.  These concerns relate to about 1% of the total number of charities in the country.<br\/><br\/>Many charities are companies limited by guarantee.  These are subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required under the Companies Acts to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office.  There are, therefore, quite a number of bodies that have responsibility for charities and how they are run.  In addition, for example, if there is criminal activity, such as fraud, that is a breach of the criminal law and could and would potentially be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Where there is a fraudulent situation, there is clearly a role for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have, therefore, seen a lot of co-operation between the necessary bodies in recent times.<br\/><br\/>The Senator asked about resources.  Significant additional resources - a budget allocation of &euro;2.665 million, representing an 88% increase over 2015 - was given by my Department for 2016.  That includes additional funding of &euro;1.25 million, which is supporting expansion in the level of staffing and other resources and these are all the building blocks we need to have in place to ensure compliance.  I want to reassure the House that I recognise the urgency of making sure that the Charities Regulatory Authority is up and running with all its functions and with the resources it needs.<br\/><br\/>I want to draw the attention of Senators to a quotation from Se&aacute;n Moynihan of Alone:<\/p><blockquote>When people choose to support a charity they do so because they are inspired by the work it does.  People are moved by stories that reach into their hearts and connect with them emotionally ...  However, we also know that we need to link these stories to comprehensive information about where your money goes, the number of people we support and the manner in which we support them.  All charities should be judged on their impact and effectiveness, not just on an emotive story; we must value those that have quality standards, are accountable and transparent.<\/blockquote><p>Recent controversies give real pause for thought about the current charity landscape in Ireland.  For example, are clients best served by having large numbers of charities to choose from, each providing similar services and each expected to operate on the basis, obviously, of proper corporate governance structures?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For example, are clients best served by having a large number of charities, each providing similar services and expected to operate on the basis of proper corporate governance structures, from which to choose?  This country needs a conversation on these issues and how we can best support the ongoing development and regulation of the charity sector.  We want to tap into the vast resources and expertise that are available as well as people's willingness to volunteer, but that needs to be managed.  When it is not managed properly, major issues arise with trust in the sector.<\/p><p>Charities receive significant State funding, and it is upsetting that people, including the thousands of good people who work in and contribute to the vital services provided by the charity sector, are being let down by poor governance standards in parts of it.  This undermines confidence in a sector that relies on good will.<\/p><p>I assure the House that I will prioritise the role of the charities regulator and ensure that it has adequate powers and resources to sustain and promote the thousands of charities around the country.  With the announcement of Part 4 commencing in September, today marks another step forward in the better governance of the sector, but I emphasise the scale of the challenge facing the regulator, given the number of charities and the fact that they have not previously been regulated to any degree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#H00200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for attending and assuring me that Part 4 will be commenced on 5 September.

In return, the three-storey Cashel hospital would be upgraded through the provision of 25 specialist and geriatric beds, 15 nursing home and convalescent beds, 20 beds for general practitioner, GP, assessment and rehabilitation and five palliative care beds, a total of 65.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Denis Landy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2349\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This was in 1996.  One of the people involved at the time, Councillor Tom Wood, from Cashel, is still trying to get beds into the hospital in Cashel.  We will roll the clock forward to the last Government's term of office.  Two phases of refurbishment of the building of Our Lady's Hospital were undertaken.  One was a new reconstruction at a total cost of &euro;10.15 million and the second phase was the main building, which I am discussing now, on which &euro;12.6 million was spent.  The final services were transferred to Clonmel in 2007.  These were the acute services and at that time the commitments were reinforced again.  However, in January 2015 there were still no step-down beds opened in Cashel by the HSE.<\/p><p>This issue has been raised regularly.  In 2015, the then Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, former Deputy Tom Hayes, announced 21 step-down beds to relieve the chronic overcrowding in Clonmel, which has been ongoing for the last number of years.  It is now 5 July 2016 and there are still no step-down beds in Cashel, after a total of almost &euro;23 million of taxpayers' money being spent on Cashel hospital for what is operating there and on the main building.  There is no return by way of beds for the public and those who are distressed by overcrowding and family situations in Clonmel.  It is time to raise this question again and seek a response from the Minister which, I hope, will stand.<\/p><p>This matter was brought to the attention of the new Minister for Health by Tipperary County Council in the months since his appointment to office.  The Minister was invited to attend the hospital but the reply the council received, on 20 June 2016, was that the Minister was currently too busy to visit the hospital.

I am aware of his background of dealing with major concerns over the last number of years, particularly with regard to health and disability issues.<\/p> <p>With regard to South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel, I understand that the increasing demand on the emergency department and the increasing numbers of patients requiring admission have resulted in delays for patients accessing inpatient beds within the current available capacity.  There have been persistent monthly increases in emergency department attendances at the hospital this year compared to the same period in 2015.  Such increases are broadly in line with the national experience.  The Department of Health has been assured, however, that, with a view to improving the current situation, the south-south west hospital group and South Tipperary General Hospital are strengthening the management structures in the hospital, expanding capacity, improving infrastructure, reviewing processes and intensifying relationships with their community and primary care colleagues.  We must focus on these issues for a start.  Management at the general hospital has advised that it does not require transitional care beds at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel.<\/p> <p>As the Senator is aware, a wide range of HSE services is currently provided across the campus at Our Lady's Hospital.

A unit on the Our Lady's Hospital campus has been upgraded to meet national standards and it is the HSE's intention to transfer residents from St. Patrick's Hospital to the new St. Clare's ward.  This will accommodate 11 elderly mentally infirm residents.  <\/p><p>The HSE's six-year capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021 includes plans to replace the current St. Patrick's Hospital with a new 100-bed community nursing unit.  It is envisaged at this time that Our Lady's Hospital will be utilised to provide interim accommodation pending the construction of the replacement for St. Patrick's Hospital.  It is important that we recognise that overcrowding is not just a problem for emergency departments alone to solve.  The response has to be multifaceted and health system-wide.  For that reason, A Programme for a Partnership Government has prioritised a number of initiatives which will reduce the numbers of patient attendances at emergency departments by developing alternative services, including primary care; increasing hospital capacity; supporting timely patient discharge from hospital; and improving the ability of the health system to respond to surges in demand for emergency care.   <\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, recently announced funding of &euro;40 million for a new winter initiative, to plan for the next two winters.

I extend my sympathies to the latest victims' families and the communities in which these shootings occurred.<br\/><br\/>The Government's performance on law and order is a matter of great concern to me.  The T&aacute;naiste recently allocated additional resources to help garda&iacute; to tackle gangland activities and those resources were to go to a special armed response unit equipped to do so.  The fact that more shootings and murders have taken place since the T&aacute;naiste announced the resourcing is an indictment of her and her Department.  How many more people need to die before the Government wakes up and realises that it is quickly loosing any semblance of being in control?  How many murders must take place in the same blatant fashion as that which occurred last Friday and today's shooting - both in broad daylight - before serious questions are posed as to the T&aacute;naiste's credibility in dealing with murderous gangs?  Another deeply worrying twist in this worsening crisis was highlighted in newspaper reports yesterday to the effect that potential witnesses are being threatened in south inner city pubs and informed that they will get a bullet in the head if they testify in upcoming cases.  This most recent development further highlights the challenges garda&iacute; face in dealing with the criminals behind these threats.  The T&aacute;naiste must wake up and realise that action and resources are required as a matter of urgency.  Failure to provide these will result in many more deaths.  If the Government does not tackle the gangs head-on, it will only be a matter of time before - as happened in Limerick - innocent people who have no connection with the warring families or criminality will be caught in the crossfire.<br\/><br\/>Further issues which buttress the argument to preserve the Special Criminal Court include the difficulty the State has in getting people to serve as jurors where gun crimes of this nature come to trial.  In 2003, it was not possible to find 12 people in Limerick to act as jurors in the trial of six people who were charged with the murder of gangland figure, Kieran Keane.  Where 729 were called to jury duty, 12 could not be found.  The T&aacute;naiste must outline publicly how she will tackle these criminals.  No further delays in the establishment of the armed response unit can be tolerated.  The T&aacute;naiste must also set out how she will protect witnesses from criminals if they are to testify.  Finally, she must introduce minimum mandatory sentencing for anyone caught in possession of an illegal firearm.  Any person caught with such a firearm should know that he or she will serve a minimum of ten years behind bars.  A sentence of that length is entirely proportionate given the worsening crisis.  We must demonstrate that we are willing to take a very hard stance on serious crimes of this nature.  I propose that the Order of Business be amended and that the T&aacute;naiste be called on to address the Seanad in order that she might outline the measures she is taking to stem the escalation in gun crime and cold-blooded murder in our cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#N00300","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>In the context of the conference held by the Association of Irish Local Government last week, I wish to point out that more than 42 new Senators have been elected to the House and that many of us were elected by local authority members.

Impartiality and independence are what people need in dealing with this serious matter.  There is no point in having this expert commission if its chairman has already made up his mind on the issue and seems to have no respect for those who have an alternative opinion.<\/p><p>If these remarks are not withdrawn, we will be asking the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come to the Seanad to explain how the commission can carry out its work appropriately under the circumstances.  It is a serious issue which affects thousands of families across the country.  So as not to undermine the credibility of the commission, the Seanad has a responsibility to address this.  It cannot be ignored.<\/p><p>Up to 187,112 family carers provide 6.2 million hours of care each week.  This morning I attended an excellent briefing by Family Carers Ireland.  The issue of carers has been discussed in the Seanad before but several matters have come to a head recently.  I know carers in my constituency who are mentally, physically and financially exhausted because of the care they are providing.  It comes as no surprise that carers are a net contributor to the economy and, indeed, to the Health Service Executive budget.  However, the figures of &euro;4 billion to the economy and a third of the HSE budget are staggering, particularly given the difficulties they continue to face in providing such a vital service.  With several months having passed since the programme for Government was published, will the Leader ascertain when phase 2 of the national carers&rsquo; strategy will be published with the associated ring-fenced funding?  This is vitally important because there is no point in having the strategy unless the moneys are ring-fenced to resource it.  It was said in 2012 that phase 2 would be revisited once the economy had recovered.  We were told <i>ad nauseam<\/i>during the election campaign that the recovery was well under way.  It is now time to set a date for the strategy&rsquo;s publication.  I support the call by Family Carers Ireland for its funding to be increased to meet the 25% increase in the population over 65.  As legislators, we can arrange for a statutory entitlement to home care services as exist for residential care.  That is vitally important.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Until it is put on a statutory footing, we will not treat carers in the way they deserve to be treated.

We have to put carers front and centre in this Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#P00700","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I join Senator Catherine Ardagh in extending condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed so tragically in Iraq.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator Rose Conway-Walsh in support of the Civil Engagement group for the proposals set out by Family Carers Ireland this morning in its pre-budget submission, in which they seek to achieve fairness for family carers.  It is undoubtedly the case that they are carrying the can for society.  It is overdue that, as a state and a society, we weighed in with them.  The need to put access to home care on a legislative footing was highlighted last week by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and Family Carers Ireland has also called for this to happen, which we support.<\/p><p>I refer to the plight of people who are homeless.  I worked for Cork Simon Community for eight years and it is a cause about which I care deeply.  Since yesterday morning, a group of homeless persons have been occupying John's Lane West Hostel off Thomas Street, which is due to close this week.  The group is protesting about the lack of replacement emergency beds.  The hostel is closing because it is to be converted into apartments.  However, the 42 residents of the hostel claim that no alternative accommodation has been provided for them and they are worried about their future.  They have little and that little is disappearing.  One of the residents is a woman by the name of Rosemary Hughes.  She is visually impaired and has a guide dog.  She has lived in the hostel for the past three months.  Yesterday, she said:<\/p><blockquote>I'm not going anywhere until this is sorted ... we want suitable accommodation; we want respect and we want to be treated like human beings ... people are really worried asthey don't have a bed for tomorrow night.<\/blockquote> <p>Rosemary who said she had &quot;slept in almost doorway in Grafton Street&quot; was placed in the hostel after being attacked on the streets.  In John's Lane she said: &quot;It's the first time I've had my own room and it feels like forever.&quot;  Asked what she would do if she lost her bed, she said she would have to &quot;go back to sleeping in the doorway of BT2 with Quilla,&quot; her dog.<\/p><p>The hostel is owned by Focus Ireland and operated by the Peter McVerry Trust.  It first opened in the winter of 2014 as part of the emergency response to the death of Mr. Jonathan Corrie who died on the streets outside Leinster House.  The Government must do everything it can to provide suitable long-term housing for homeless persons like Rosemary.  In the short term, with others, she must be provided with an alternative emergency bed this week.  Similar to the closure of John's Lane West hostel, the Dublin Simon hostel on Harcourt Street is due to close and there are strong objections to the replacement service on Fitzwilliam Square, putting even more emergency beds at risk.  In May 102 people were sleeping rough in Dublin, an increase of 12% since last November.  This is on top of the 4,262 people in emergency beds, of whom approximately 1,800 are children.  Senators and Deputies must ensure the energy and momentum for change generated in the aftermath of the general election are not lost and that the recent recommendations of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness are implemented.  They include the provision of 50,000 social housing units, rent certainty, security of tenure and ensuring no homeless shelters are closed until alternative accommodation is found.  Before the John's Lane West and Harcourt Street hostels are closed permanently, Rosemary and other residents should be provided with safe and secure alternative accommodation.  I would be grateful if the Leader would raise this urgent issue directly with the Minister responsible before tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#Q00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>The Protection of Life in Pregnancy (Amendment) (Fatal Foetal Abnormalities) (No. 2) Bill 2013 was introduced by Deputy Mick Wallace in the D&aacute;il last week and I support it.

They then charge parking fees outside their doors.  We need the Minister, all relevant groups and the local authorities to draw up a plan.  From what I saw while travelling around rural Ireland during the Seanad election campaign, all we need now is tumbleweed in certain towns because no business is being conducted.  This is happening all over Ireland.  I would, therefore, like to see the Minister come into the House and planning authorities in rural Ireland considering this issue which represents a serious problem for retail businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#S01000","speaker":"1423","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see that interest in our electorate, particularly county councillors, has come to the fore.

I compliment an initiative by Q102, a Dublin radio station, which has been good at highlighting matters such as this.  It gives a Sugar Savvy Card to listeners, which outlines basic facts such as 4g of sugar equalling one teaspoon and sugar consumption per day, which should be no more than 12 teaspoons for an adult.  The card also highlights the different ways sugar can be described on a menu, including syrup, honey, malt, cane, molasses and so on.  I raise this issue frequently and I am sure I sound like a killjoy but this is important and I would be grateful if the Leader would agree to bring the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, to the House discuss this in the near future.

He is putting a plan in place, with a package of measures.

The Minister has agreed to come to the House on social protection issues ahead of the budget.

Veronica Guerin's murder by ruthless men marked a very dark hour in the life of this country, an enduring loss for her family and friends and an important turning point in the fight against crime.  Six weeks after her murder, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 was enacted and two months after that the Criminal Assets Bureau Act was passed.  In doing that, these Houses developed an innovative model for depriving gangsters and murderers of the proceeds of their crimes.<\/p> <p>The Irish model is one that has been studied and copied by some countries, and envied by many that have not done so.  In the intervening period, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, has retrieved hundreds of millions of euro in proceeds of crime, unpaid taxes and fraudulently obtained welfare payments.  It has been so successful that it has driven some gang leaders overseas, leaving only their accomplices here to run their day-to-day drugs businesses.  We have now reached another turning point.  Those subordinates of the offshore drug barons have brought murder to our streets in an appalling way in recent months.  We must respond, and we are doing that.  We, as the State, the Parliament, the Government, law enforcement agencies and communities, will stand together to face down those who would put themselves above the law and above the lives of others.  Their motivation is greed for wealth, and we will do all we can to deprive them of their wealth.<\/p> <p>I and my officials met the Garda Commissioner, the chief of the Criminal Assets Bureau and other senior officers to examine what further measures could be taken to pressurise and deal with the lower-level gang activity taking place.  Five weeks ago, I secured the agreement of the Government to a package of measures to increase the pressure on organised criminals.  That package includes the establishment of a special crime task force by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  The task force will focus relentlessly on persons involved in gangland activities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Government has consistently made it clear that we will fund whatever measures are needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges it faces.  We have backed up these assurances with the recent approval of substantial additional funding of some &euro;55 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <br\/><br\/>We need to invest the Garda and the CAB with the right legislative powers.  There is already in place a wide range of strong legislative measures to deal with gangland activities.  These measures include the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 which brought forward provisions to respond to the reality of intimidation by criminal gangs; the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009; the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which addressed the use of weapons; the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 to enhance international co-operation which is essential in the fight against organised crime gangs; and the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  Therefore, we have a range of criminal justice legislative provisions in place.<br\/><br\/>I am introducing proposals to enhance and update the legislative framework for the lawful interception of communications and covert electronic surveillance to combat the threats from serious and organised crime and terrorism.  We discussed this issue at the Cabinet today.  Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe that cannot respond to warrants from other countries in this area because of the lack of legislation.<br\/><br\/>In the shorter term the prescribed sum under section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, under which cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime may be seized by garda&iacute; or Revenue officers, will be reduced from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000 by way of section 44 regulations.  The necessary motion for the approval by the D&aacute;il of these regulations will be debated tomorrow evening.  The approval of this House will be sought shortly afterwards. <br\/><br\/>The other key immediate legislative change is this Bill.  At the Government meeting its drafting was approved as a matter of urgency.  It has been crafted quickly but very carefully to provide additional powers for the CAB to target the proceeds of crime.  We are very conscious of the balances that have to be maintained in the legislation.  We have had several challenges during the years to the CAB legislation, each of which the State has won.<br\/><br\/>At present, the CAB has no power under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize and detain the proceeds of crime without making an application to the court.  Section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 allows for it to make an <i>ex parte<\/i>application to the High Court for an interim order.  An interim order can prohibit any person from disposing of or dealing with any property if the court is satisfied that it constitutes the proceeds of crime.  To seek such an order, the CAB must have marshalled all of the relevant evidence and be in a position to establish that the property derives from criminal conduct.  Given the level of scrutiny applied by the court to such an application, particularly as it is an <i>ex parte <\/i>application where only the applicant is heard by the court, this is a challenging task for the CAB.  The new power will now allow CAB officers to move quickly to seize property and they will have 21 days to prepare their court application. <br\/><br\/>The Bill will also allow gang members to be targeted by reducing the threshold that applies under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.  The Bill is being brought forward as an urgent measure in order that these changes will be available to the CAB without delay.  Senators may have other proposals for reform, but I ask that such proposals not delay unduly the rapid passage of the Bill and instead be considered as part of the wider review of the proceeds of crime legislation which can deliver further reforms in the medium term.<br\/><br\/>The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 operates as civil law.  The applications made under it to the High Court rely on the civil standard of proof - the balance of probabilities.  It operates, as the legal experts say, <i>in rem<\/i>, not <i>in personam<\/i>, to target property, not persons.  No finding is made as to the guilt of a person, as happens in a criminal trial; rather, a finding is made on whether the property is the proceeds of crime.  Provision is made for the belief of a Garda chief superintendent to be admitted as evidence.  The Act allows for an interlocutory order to be made where the court is satisfied on the evidence from the CAB that property is the proceeds of crime and, to an extent, shifts the onus to the respondent to disprove the case.  The Act contains no criminal offences and no penal sanctions.<br\/><br\/>Early on in its operation, the civil status of the Act was considered in litigation.  In the Murphy <i>v.<\/i>G. M. and Gilligan <i>v<\/i>. CAB cases the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Keane, noted that the legislation was &quot;unquestionably draconian&quot; and then addressed the key point of whether proceedings under the Act were civil or criminal in nature.  Following an extensive review of the case law on the factors that differentiated between criminal and civil actions, he found the appellants had failed to establish that the Act amounted to criminal proceedings.  It is possible to maintain the special provisions of the Act because they amount to civil proceedings.  Any addition to the Act, therefore, must not tip the balance of the Act in order that they become criminal proceedings.  It is for that reason that I want to emphasise the care which has been taken to ensure the Bill is not only constitutionally sound but also sustainable in the special civil context of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act.  The Attorney General has not only reviewed its provisions but has also had external senior counsel consider it twice, first when the scheme was being developed and again when the final draft was prepared.  The chief bureau officer and the bureau legal officer were consulted on a number of occasions by my officials as the Bill was developed to ensure all their knowledge, experience and expertise were brought to bear.  Even with all that care, there are some minor textual errors in the Bill that need to be corrected on Committee Stage.  That is the other key reason I ask that more extensive proposals for change be considered as part of the wider review of the proceeds of crime legislation which can deliver further reforms in the medium term.  I would like all such proposals to undergo the same rigorous checking by my officials and the Office of the Attorney General and the CAB to be consulted on them.  <br\/><br\/>The proceeds of crime legislation has served us very well.  When one examines annual reports showing the detail on proceeds of crime and the amounts involved over the years, one notes the success of the CAB.  Many other countries want to copy our model and others are very impressed by the way it has operated.  It has served us well and been important in dealing with criminal activity.  It has been tested time and again in the courts.  We must be sure changes to this carefully honed legislative tool do not blunt or break it in any way.  It is important for the State to have this legislation in place and be able to use it effectively, given the challenges An Garda faces nationally and internationally from criminals.<br\/><br\/>Let me turn to the details of the Bill.  Its Long Title indicates that it is to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996.  Section 1 defines the &quot;Principal Act&quot; as being the 1996 Act.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 contains two definitions. <br\/><br\/>Section 3 inserts three new sections providing for the administrative seizure and detention of property other than land by the Criminal Assets Bureau, applications to the court and compensation.<br\/><br\/>The new section 1A allows a bureau officer who is in a public place or any other place in which he or she is permitted to be to seize any property he or she has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be the proceeds of crime.  It is intended to provide for seizure of the suspected proceeds of crime, both where the property is discovered opportunistically as part of general CAB operations or as part of a focused operation targeting particular suspected proceeds.  The bureau officer must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property, in whole or in part and directly or indirectly, constitutes the proceeds of crime and is of a total value of not less than &euro;5,000.  Once these criteria are met, the bureau officer may seize and detain the property for up to 24 hours.  This represents a serious interference with the property rights and potentially other rights of individuals; hence the need to limit the period in which it can have effect.  Any further detention beyond 24 hours must meet the additional criteria set out in subsection (2).  The chief bureau officer, the head of the bureau, can authorise the further detention of the property for up to 21 days if the criteria included in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are cumulatively met.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The whole purpose of the section is evident in paragraph (c).  It is to allow CAB time to prepare for an interim or interlocutory application to the High Court.<\/p><p>Subsection (3) requires that the chief bureau officer give written notice to all affected persons unless satisfied that it is not reasonably possible to attain their whereabouts.  The notice shall include the reasons for the authorisation and inform them of their right to make an application under section 1B.  Subsection (5) allows details, the disclosure of which might prejudice the investigation, to be withheld.  I will table a Committee Stage amendment to correct a small error here.  The section currently refers to a \"direction\" but should read \"authorisation\".<\/p><p>The new section 1B provides protections for affected persons by allowing them to apply to the court to vary or revoke an authorisation made by the chief bureau officer under section 1A.  The court can vary or revoke the authorisation if satisfied that any one of the criteria outlined in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d), to which I have referred, is not met.  The word \"not\" will have to be inserted in paragraph (b) before the words \"less than &euro;5,000\", and there will be a Committee Stage amendment to that effect.<\/p><p>The new section 1C provides for an application for compensation for losses incurred by the owner of the property if CAB fails to apply for or obtain an interim or interlocutory order from the court.  I will table a minor amendment to section 1C to clarify that a compensation application can be made where such an order is not sought before the expiration of the authorisation.<\/p><p>Sections 4, 5, and 6 amend the relevant provisions of the principal Act to reduce the threshold value of the property from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides the Short Title and relevant citations and a standard commencement provision.<\/p><p>I reiterate that we will face down the current threat posed by criminal gangs and will do whatever is necessary to ensure that nobody is above the law.  I think Senators will agree that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has done some great work in dealing with the current situation.  This legislation aims to help this work and follows on from detailed discussion and consultation with people dealing with these issues on the front line day in, day out.  They have shown absolute determination and resolve in the face of what I think Senators would agree is unprecedented ruthlessness from the gangs.  I want to make it clear once again that there will be no let-up in the pressure that will be put on these criminal gangs and the actions that will be taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the relevant authorities, to deal with the threat that they pose.  The gangs are involved in a cycle of revenge and retaliation, the consequences of which we have all seen.  Their outrageous actions are in very sharp contrast to the dignity that we have seen in local communities in the face of the threat that they pose.  The communities have the right to live safely and securely.  All sides of both Houses came together as one 20 years ago to reject the violence, greed and indifference to human suffering that we saw in the leaders of the drug gangs.  I hope we can do so again today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#EE01200","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome her comments on this Bill.  Just over a week ago, the 20th anniversary of the murder of Veronica Guerin was marked.  The Criminal Assets Bureau was established and the proceeds of crime legislation introduced as it was acknowledged that new powers were needed by the authorities to deal with the threat of criminal gangs who thought nothing of murdering a young mother and journalist just 20 years ago.  The proceeds of crime legislation empowered CAB to identify and seize assets of persons which derived, or were suspected to derive, directly or indirectly from criminal conduct.  Given the gangland murders in Dublin over the past number of months, and particularly in the wake of today's apparent gangland shooting in my constituency, in Lusk, in north County Dublin, these powers urgently need updating.  While I accept the Minister's comments that they have served us well, they have been in place for 20 years, the nature of crime has evolved and our legislation therefore needs to evolve likewise.  The shooting in Lusk marks a frightening escalation in gangland-associated crime.  I live in the locality of this latest shooting and the community today is shocked and frightened.  While the exact circumstances of the shooting are still unfolding, I am extremely concerned that there is an apparent link between this latest shooting and the spate of gangland-related killings over the past number of months.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the amendments before the House.  Communities, particularly here in Dublin, are under siege.  They have been calling for these changes to be made to help keep their young people out of these gangs and out of a life of crime.  The lowering of the threshold value for property subject to seizure by CAB from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000 allows middle and lower-level criminals to be brought into the net of CAB.  Young people in many communities, as we all know, across this city and communities across the country see criminals driving around in nice cars and wearing expensive jewellery and see their life of crime as an attractive choice.  Oftentimes these assets have a value of less than &euro;13,000 and therefore do not come under the current remit of CAB.  These criminals are rubbing ordinary, decent, hardworking, law-abiding citizens' noses in it every day by showing their ill-gotten gains around their community.  More importantly, this allows these criminals to attract new members into their gangs.  Criminality is often seen as glamorous and a viable career choice for many young people with limited prospects in life.  These criminals are often given cult-like status in their communities.<\/p><p>The other changes this Bill seeks to make are also welcomed and necessary to fight against crime.  The procedure by which goods are seized needs to be changed.  Currently, garda&iacute;, as the Minister has outlined, need to make an <i>ex parte<\/i>application to the High Court for an interim order.  Given the level of scrutiny applied by the court to such applications, it is a very challenging task for garda&iacute; to undertake, and the amount of time required is enormous.  Consequently, goods are often dispersed and CAB cannot then seize them.  The new procedure would allow a chief bureau officer seize the goods for 24 hours on the basis of having reasonable grounds for suspecting them to be the proceeds of crime.  This 24-hour period would allow for inquiries to be made.  Before this 24-hour period expires, the chief bureau officer can then authorise the goods' further detention for 21 days.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this amendment.  The authorities need to be empowered to deal with the increasingly sophisticated criminal fraternity we now see in our capital city and in cities and towns all around the country.<\/p><p>Opponents of these amendments cite the interference to our constitutional right to property, and rightly so.  I am therefore happy that the new section 1(b) provides protection for affected persons by allowing them to apply to the High Court to vary or revoke an authorisation made by a chief bureau officer under section 1(a).  Section 1(c) provides for an application for compensation for losses incurred by the owner of the property.  I am further reassured by the Minister's comments on the further safeguards in the legislation.  Given the gravity of the situation facing the country and the threat to law and order, Fianna F&aacute;il wishes to propose an amendment to section 4(a) by lowering the time the State has to retain the seized goods from seven years to four years.  Separately, we also welcome the amending of regulations to lower the sum of cash set out in section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000.  All these measures are necessary to fight the biggest threat to the security of the State since provisional republican terrorism was rampant on these islands.  However, greater harmonisation of EU laws should be a priority also, given the international aspect to these crimes.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il also renews its call on the Government to establish a Dublin armed support unit as a matter of urgency.  The latest shootings in Dublin last Friday in the south inner city and today in Lusk mark a serious escalation in gun crime.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are also calling for additional supports, such as counselling services, to be made available to children affected by crime in their communities.

It is 20 years almost to the month since Veronica Guerin was brutally murdered in Dublin by drug barons.  At the time, I was graduating from University College Dublin and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality was our local Deputy.  The then coalition Government, under the stewardship of the then Minister, Nora Owen, introduced the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, which led to the creation of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  This was ground-breaking at the time because it hit the criminals where it hurt them, namely, in their pockets.  It removed the proceeds of crime and ill-gotten gains from them.  They were not allowed to keep the properties they accumulated as a result of their vicious, murdering crimes.<\/p> <p>The constitutionality of the CAB legislation is the most tested.  A particular criminal, who created enormous hardship in the streets of this city, dragged that legislation through the courts, right up to the Supreme Court.  The Government, the State and Ireland won, however, and every challenge was defeated.<\/p> <p>This Bill is a natural progression.  As Senator Clifford-Lee quite rightly pointed out, crime has evolved and, as such, the response must evolve as well.  This Bill is necessary as a result of the evolution of crime and what we saw in the streets of Dublin city this morning where somebody was gunned down in broad daylight.  It is appropriate to reduce the threshold value of property subject to the Act from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.  It is also appropriate to allow a CAB official seize property if, in his or her valued judgment, the property is a result of the proceeds of crime.<\/p> <p>People's constitutional rights are also protected in this legislation.  If a seized property is not a result of the proceeds of crime and the owner can prove that in the courts, then the property will be returned to him or her.  If the owner has lost income as a result, he or she will be compensated for it.  The balancing introduced in this legislation further strengthens it.<\/p> <p>We are at war with criminals in Dublin city and in this country.  We have to win.  We cannot let those people win.  They are winning at the moment because they are succeeding in murdering people on the streets of this city and in inflicting pain and suffering on people throughout the country.  This Government, however, is determined to defeat them.  Since coming into office, it has increased the budget to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by &euro;55 million.  This increased investment will continue.  The Government is committed to investing in high-powered vehicles to catch criminals and respond appropriately.  The Government is investing in upgrading the ICT equipment available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the PULSE system, which was ground-breaking at the time, will be fit for purpose in the modern era.<\/p> <p>In the spirit of new politics, we must all come together to ensure democracy beats criminality and that the people in this city and in this country can live with no fear as well as ensuring they feel safe in their homes and streets.  We are determined the murderous thugs, who have frightened the living daylights out of the people in inner city Dublin, will be beaten.  This is an important incremental step to ensure they will be beaten.  If the legislation needs to be further developed, evolved and improved, on the advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those at the coalface, I have no doubt the  Minister and the Government will not be found wanting in further amending legislation to deal with this savagery in the city of Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#HH00200","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on her elevation to T&aacute;naiste.  I congratulate her too for bringing forward this legislation as rapidly as is possible in the system in which we work.<\/p> <p>I find myself wondering where we have come from in this country.  I remember as a young man in Salthill in Galway witnessing a stand-off one night outside the Hangar ballroom between a group of thugs from Dublin on one side and a group of thugs from Galway on the other.  There was one garda on his own standing in the middle but neither group would move because he was there.  Where have we gone?  Today, we have a situation where thugs wander around Dublin city with firearms.  I carried firearms for ten years of my life and I learned to respect them at all levels.  I have fired almost every type of weapon there is to fire.  The one thing I learned from the earliest time was how dangerous an instrument they are.  Criminals will open fire in crowded areas and in the middle of groups.  They do not care about the likelihood of ricochets, who they kill or how they kill them for that matter.  What the Minister is doing is commendable.<\/p> <p>However, I am a little concerned we need to bring on more trained garda&iacute; faster.  I know the Minister is constrained in the time it takes to train a garda but there is no point in moving a garda out of one area to arm him or her in another, meaning somewhere else is missing out.  I know the Minister is doing her best and Templemore college is working hard to get garda&iacute; on the streets as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>The Bill suggests we are after a particular type of criminal.  Last year, I spoke about my concerns about gambling and the proceeds of crime.  I am aware of one particular betting shop where one particular customer, who is now residing as a guest of Her Majesty in Manchester, would throw &euro;20,000 on the counter every Saturday and tell the guys behind the counter to put a couple of bob on every favourite for the day.  If I walked into AIB, Bank of Ireland or Ulster Bank with &euro;20,000 today, they would want to know from where I got it.  There are no regulations which force gambling institutions or organisations to inquire as to where the money for a bet came from.  It is very easy to throw to throw &euro;20,000 behind a betting shop&rsquo;s counter, if one is willing to lose &euro;10,000 of it to wash it through the system.  The Minister knows I have an amendment on this area, which I hope the Government will take on board.<\/p> <p>We really have to move in on all the areas in which these criminals work.  The particular guy I referred to derives his money from trafficking young women into Ireland, beating them to a pulp until such a time as they are prepared to act as prostitutes.  Then the revenue he raises from that, he cleanses by putting it on horses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

I could not afford to put &euro;3.70 on a horse, let alone &euro;37,000.  If people can do this, it is important that while the Bill seeks to tackle mid-level criminals, many of the thugs hide behind mid-level criminals.  They can cleanse their dirty money through betting shops and the gambling system.  A provision to address this should be included in the legislation.  The Minister had intended to bring the gambling Bill before the House and I acknowledge there have been problems with that.  I hope she finds a resolution in the near future in order that the Bill can be brought forward.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there is a hierarchy on the streets.  Some of these guys do not care who they injure or how they injure them.  They have a commitment to meet because they owe the guy up the food chain money.  The only way to pay that off is either through stealing or another criminal act.  I wish the Minister all the best with the Bill.  She is working hard in this area and she is doing all she can.  I passed a rapid response vehicle the other day but I am a little concerned about them.  One of my colleagues referred earlier to \"chasing them down\".  Sometimes in chasing these criminals, innocent people are killed in road traffic accidents and so on.  I hope substantial amounts raised through the CAB are put into the training of garda&iacute; as expert drivers and expert marksmen in the use of weapons, which can cause fair destruction.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister on what she is doing.

I welcome the fact that, in drafting the legislation, the Minister has sought to strike a balance between giving CAB the practical powers it needs to combat criminality and the rights of innocent persons who have the capacity to prove their assets were obtained by legal means.  However, our support for the Bill and the overall approach to CAB is not unqualified and a range of matters must be dealt with before the Bill concludes its passage through the Houses.  It is essential that moneys seized by CAB can be put back into the communities worst affected by drugs and organised crime.  There is no bar to this happening and we will table amendments to this effect.  Deputy Fergus O'Dowd tabled legislation designed to do exactly that in 2003 and I urge Fine Gael, in particular, to reintroduce and update the Bill or incorporate the intent of the Bill in this legislation.<\/p> <p>Approximately &euro;14 million was seized solely under proceeds of crime legislation between 2006 and 2010.  We have asked the Government on numerous occasions to retain this money for community development purposes and to give it to organisations in the communities worst affected by these criminals.  They are at the front line trying to help, protect and support them through all of this.  This is separate from the money seized by CAB in respect of Revenue and social welfare fraud.  The money is taken from drug dealers and criminals who are profiting from the communities they are decimating.  It is not good enough that the Government sees fit to use CAB as a vehicle to raise revenue while continually reducing funding allocated to the communities that are victims of crime and, at some point, I hope it takes this on board.  It is important that if the revenue raised by CAB is allocated to community organisations, particularly in inner city communities worst affected by criminality, it is not a replacement for existing funding and, therefore, it is additional funding.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in's view is this money should be set aside for these communities, for example, to be used as a funding mechanism for the local drugs task forces' short to medium-term projects.  The Government has cut community funding in general and the current legislation allows for all moneys collected by CAB to be returned to the Exchequer in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005.  The funds are then paid into the Government's Central Fund from which it draws for expenditure.  If the Government had the political will to fund these much-needed community organisations, it could easily do so by amending these Acts.  We call on the Government to introduce this mechanism to fund local drugs task forces and community groups.<\/p> <p>We have concerns regarding the absence of safeguards and while cognisant of the High Court decisions in respect of the Proceeds of Crime Acts in the past, we wonder if the reduction in the threshold of proof has dropped so low as to raise issues about its constitutionality.

I will deal separately with the regulation lowering the amount of cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime that may be seized from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000.<\/p> <p>I can just about handle the reduction in the threshold value of property subject to the Act from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000 in the Bill but I am concerned about the fact that family members can be subject to this provision.  Because the property at issue could be the proceeds of crime, the provisions are not individual to the person who committed the crime, as I understand it.  I would like clarification on that.  There are many hard-working family members who have nothing to do with their loved ones' criminality and I do not want the legislation to be abused in terms of them having to prove they own a car or jewellery.  What suffices as proof of ownership?  It is easy in respect of a car because the log book or the registration certificate can be produced but it is not as easy for jewellery or IT equipment.  Will there be set criteria on what constitutes proof of ownership in order that people can claim they are the lawful owner?<\/p> <p>The Bill refers to authorised officers finding or coming \"into possession of any property that he or she has reasonable grounds for suspecting\" was obtained through criminal activity.  Will there be set criteria on what constitutes \"reasonable\"?  Will it be up to the Garda or will there be a set structure to define \"reasonable\"?  The Bill also makes reference to the threshold value of property subject to the Act being \"no less than &euro;5,000\".  Is that for a single item of property or will CAB have the power to group pieces of property belonging to one person to make up the value of &euro;5,000?  I would have a problem if that was the case and I would like this clarified.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the regulation is separate from the Bill but I have an issue with it being another regulation that goes after low-hanging fruit.  When the amount is lowered to &euro;1,000, we will again be hitting the people who are probably forced into carrying cash and into being mules.  There is also a grey economy in working class communities involving counterfeit goods right down to MAC make up brushes and tanning injections.  Will lowering the amount that can be seized to &euro;1,000 leave the people at the bottom wide open to attack from the authorities?   It is often said that people who owe a debt to others further up the chain are being forced to carry out the murders.  Will removing the &euro;1,000 debt from the person at the bottom of the chain add to the cycle of criminality?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Will that person be the next one who will have to pull the trigger because he or she has to make up the shortfall?<\/p><p>The fundamental purpose of the Criminal Assets Bureau is to remove the motive for profit.

I will deal with that aspect when it arises but I would like to get clarification on the first question I asked.

I also welcome the opportunity to debate this important issue.  All of us and others outside the House have spoken of the wider context in which the Bill is being proposed.  All of us have seen horrific murders in recent weeks and months.  Many have mentioned the shooting today in Lusk and there was another shooting last week very close to where I live in a busy shopping street in the south inner city.  All of us have been shocked by the brutality of these murders and shootings and by the recent violence, although we acknowledge they represent only a small number of individuals who are connected to an international and national drugs trade and to criminal organisations.  That is the context within which the Bill is being introduced and, clearly, a key aim of the Bill is to act to seek to tackle those involved in criminal organisations at low and middle level.  I recognise that tackling organised crime at all levels is a priority for the Government and all of us acknowledge that.  There is no doubt that the escalation of crime, particularly in inner city Dublin in recent months, requires a proactive approach.<\/p> <p>I and my party colleagues in the Labour Party would emphasise, and I am sure most would agree, that tackling this level of this type of organised crime requires tackling the core issues of disadvantage, of drug use and of tackling these in a way where we do not only have a criminal justice approach.  I share Senator Ruane's concern about criminalising addiction and my colleague, Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in expressed that view recently in a debate on the misuse of drugs legislation.  We would clearly support a model that would examine much broader issues and that would redirect attention and investment towards disadvantaged communities suffering from a lack of opportunity.  We drafted our amendment along the lines of the amendment, to which Senator Mac Lochlainn referred, concerning the ring-fencing of any proceeds or money confiscated towards disadvantaged communities.  <\/p> <p>The Minister said she would be seeking Cabinet approval today for new legislation allowing increased interception powers for garda&iacute; to intercept e-mails, social media accounts and so on.  She has spoken today of the further motion that will be brought before this and the other House concerning reducing the sum under which cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime may be seized by the Garda or Revenue Commissioners under the Criminal Justice Act.  We will have an opportunity to debate that at another date.  I emphasise the need in both of those areas - in the area of increased powers of interception and in the area where we are considering a regulation to reduce the limit to &euro;1,000 with respect to powers of seizure under the criminal justice legislation - we would have to make sure that we are striking a balance between effective investigatory powers and fundamental due process rights.  The Minister has also emphasised the need for that.<\/p> <p>Turning to this Bill, we must be mindful of the need to strike a balance.  The Minister quoted from the litigation under the original 1996 Proceeds of Crime Act in which the courts refer to this Act as bringing in draconian powers, and indeed those powers of civil forfeiture were unprecedented at the time.  Ireland was one of the first countries to introduce them in the context of the appalling murder of Veronica Guerin and also the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe 20 years ago.  That was the context at the time.  I had the pleasure some months ago of chairing an Irish centre for European Law conference at the Royal Irish Academy on the enforcement of laws against transnational crimes across the EU.  It was interesting to hear form people in the front line of law enforcement who have such an interest in our model of civil forfeiture.  Having listened to those people speak, there is no doubt that they face enormous challenges in dealing with transnational crime but, again, at that conference and at all other forums where we are dealing with this issue, we must be conscious of the need to balance enhanced powers for law enforcement officers with the need to ensure protection for due progress rights.<\/p> <p>Turning to this amending legislation, which amends the 1996 Act which was introduced due to bring in a civil forfeiture regime, we must be concerned that we do not unbalance the delicate crafting of the 1996 regime.  Others have mentioned the huge amount of jurisprudence litigation that has developed since 1996.  We must be careful that any amendments to the 1996 Act do not unbalance it or unduly encroach on due process rights.<\/p> <p>I would make the following three points.  First, we in the Labour Party will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage aimed at ring-fencing the proceeds seized under the legislation to go towards addressing issues of disadvantage.  Others have spoke about that also.  I accept that the Minister has spoken about a wider review in terms of this legislation and that issue may come under that wider review but it is important we would bring it forward during the debate on this Bill.  A second issue, which was raised previously, is that there are concerns that there may be unforeseen consequences flowing from the significant reduction in the threshold to &euro;5,000, for example, with respect to those engaged in prostitution where proceeds of moneys gained from the sale of sex may be seized.  We will bring forward an amendment on that to take account of the proposed change in the law in the sex offences Bill which, as the Minister will know, I strongly support, with respect to the change in the law on prostitution.  However, we must be careful that this change will be reflected in this Bill to ensure that those engaged in prostitution will not have money seized under this legislation, as that would be an unforeseen consequence.  I am referring here to those on the ground, I am not referring to those involved in pimping or organised crime where, clearly, the legislation is directed towards them.<\/p> <p>I want to return to section 3 of this Bill which deals with the extension of powers of seizure and detention to CAB officers and, in particular, to the chief bureau officer.  We need to carefully scrutinise those provisions.  They represent a very significant expansion of the powers and of a very significant extension of the current civil forfeiture regime.  The current regime requires court supervision and empowers the CAB to apply to the court for interim or interlocutory orders under 1996 Act, whereas the new legislation proposes to enable CAB officers and the chief bureau officer to freeze assets or proceeds of crime, where they consider there is a reasonable grounds for suspecting a split in the proceeds of crime, for 24 hours and then for 21 days.<\/p> <p>We need to be particularly careful about the significant expansion of powers here.  In particular, it would be sensible and in keeping with constitutional concerns to at least include some provision requiring that the CAB officers could not keep the property up to that maximum period without some obligation to go to the court if the tests under sections 2 and 3 of the 1996 Act apply.  There are similar provisions already in place that we could use as a model.  The  Criminal Justice Act 1984 brought in the power of detention for up to 24 hours at the time but section 4(5) of the 1984 Act provides that where the Garda has enough evidence to prefer a charge, it must, without delay, charge the person, even if that is within the period of detention permitted.  In other words, in order to be careful about introducing safeguards, there should at least be some provision in the new Bill that requires CAB officers to go to court where they have enough evidence to seek an interim or interlocutory order.<\/p> <p>We must be mindful that in sections 2 and 3 of the 1996 Act there are careful safeguards in place to ensure, for example, that people who have legitimate businesses are not targeted unfairly and, as was said, we must be careful that people do not lose out.  Many of us may have heard of cases where, for example, criminal proceeds are being stored unknown to legitimate business owners on their premises and their property is then seized at a huge loss to their business and it takes them some time then to recoup that.  We know that may be happening already but, clearly, court supervision is provided for in the 1996 Act.  This significantly expands the powers of seizure and detention of property.  We need to be careful that where we are doing this, and I recognise the reason for it and the importance of it to enable the CAB to prepare the evidence for the interim and interlocutory order applications, we should consider some additional safeguard to require that they go to court immediately within the 21 day period where they have requisite evidence gathered or the application prepared under the 1996 Act.  We are working on drafting an amendment of that nature but I thought I would raise it here because we must be mindful of that section 3 power, which is probably the most significant aspect of the Bill, more significant than the lowering of the threshold, which perhaps has been the issue on which there has been most public focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#KK00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1467725400,"counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#LL00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that was agreed earlier.

This is a very important Bill.  In her very fine address, the Minister evoked the memory of the late Veronica Guerin whose story demonstrated the need to create the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  It is important when looking at CAB, crime and assets that we remember the work of Barry Galvin in that time.  As the Minister said in her speech, the model is one that is now used across the world.  We must ensure, arising from the Bill, that gangland crime is not condoned or accepted in any shape or form.  The glamorisation of gangland crime on television forms in the impressionable minds of some an aspiration in the way television programmes about the Mafia did in the past.  The reality on the ground is that people die and lives are ruined.  People are affected.  It is not like television where one can switch it off or change the channel.  This is real life and it has implications and an import for people's lives.  This morning, someone was seriously injured on foot of whatever motivation.  People are killed.  It is critical that we resource garda&iacute; and work with the Commissioner in the delivery of policing.  That is why it is important that those in organised crime are hunted down and brought before the courts and that their assets are taken from them.<\/p> <p>The Minister has been very proactive in her response and is on the side of the person in the community whether, as I said on the Order of Business, he or she is in north County Dublin, south Dublin, Cork city or whatever other part of the country.  The Minister referred in her speech to CAB's powers and we need to ensure the lacuna there is addressed.  As we move towards the budgetary Estimate in the autumn, it is clear to many of us that if we are to deliver a new type of policing, the Garda must be provided not only with the physical human resource of increased garda&iacute; but also new equipment and that we must also address issues around pay and conditions.  As such, the Minister has been pioneering and instrumental in the last D&aacute;il and Seanad in seeking to recruit more garda&iacute; and to reopen Templemore and in placing a greater emphasis on the need for properly resourced patrol cars.  It is important we ensure the work of garda&iacute; is supported and that we pay tribute to them on the huge amount of work they do.  They put their lives at risk.  Those of us who serve on policing forums nationally recognise the availability and decency of garda&iacute;.  We can never concede to the men of violence who operate in some parts of our country.  They have no place in our society, represent a minority and it is time we stood up to them.  I heard some people speak today about witness intimidation.  We cannot allow that to continue and should also be on the side of those who stand for law and order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#MM00500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on her appointment as T&aacute;naiste.  I welcome the swift process by which she has brought the Bill before the House.  It is unfortunate that we need to enact this in the general social context and it is unfortunate that the situation is unchanged after 20 years and that the original Act is unfit for purpose.  Hence, the need for changes.  My party colleagues and I welcome the changes but I would like to set out some caveats.  I listened to the debate today with interest, as a Senator from a rural area.  While we have a serious problem in parts of our cities with gangland crime, there has been no mention of rural Ireland.  The saying is that from the smallest acorn grows the largest oak tree.  It is very important that we have the resources in place to enforce the new legislation in rural areas and in our rural communities.  Gangs like the ones we see operating in the city centre are in their infancy in rural Ireland and it is there that we need to act almost as stringently.  We find ourselves fire-fighting in the city currently as things have got ahead of us.  Hence, the need for rushed legislation.  Prevention is far better than cure, as the saying goes, and we need to have the Garda resources and personnel to enforce the amended legislation at a very early stage.<\/p> <p>With that in mind and with regard to the section 38 amendment, I take on board very much what Senator Ruane said.  It was an angle from which I had not looked at the matter.  However, looking again from the rural side, &euro;1,000 is still too high.  If an 18 year old at a social function or outside a school disco has &euro;400 to &euro;600 in his pocket, we all know where it came from.  I take on board what Senator Ruane said.  It was a good and well-made point but from my perspective, &euro;1,000 is still way too high.<\/p> <p>At the other end of the scale is the need for the harmonisation of EU law.  The main offenders are, unfortunately, living on mainland Europe and they are untouchable.  Until we have harmonisation of EU law whereby assets can be seized in other European countries from Irish criminals based there, we will continue to have a major problem.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We will still only be getting the mules, the gofers and the henchmen.

Every time I look at the television monitor, I see her speaking in one of the Chambers.  She is an exceptionally busy T&aacute;naiste and Minister.<\/p> <p>I have read these proposals and the amendments, which I think are measured, balanced and appropriate.  This is a balancing act and the measure has to be appropriate but the Minister is tough on crime and I salute her for that.  She is known to be tough on crime, which is important because that is what the people want.  Crime comes in many guises, as Senator Craughwell said, and it is always difficult to keep ahead of the pace, given there are so many ways of dodging justice and the law.  The Garda and those who work against criminal activity want to be supported in their work.  It needs to be supported from the top down - from the Minister down - and I have no doubt about the Minister's commitment.  Therefore, this measure is particularly appropriate.<\/p> <p>It is worth noting that there are safeguards, as there must be with any legislation.  The ability to apply to the courts to have an authorisation removed or amended and to make a case is appropriate, which is what I mean by an appropriate and a fair response.  It is not just a catch-all situation because people have recourse to the law.  Communities across this city, county and country are ravaged by crime and criminal activity, be it with regard to drugs, smuggling, prostitution or a whole range of crimes.  Many people are hooked into crime who do not give their full consent or who are not even fully aware how they are hooked into criminal activity.<\/p> <p>This is a good measure which, as I said, is fair and appropriate.  I will be fully supporting the Minister in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#NN00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate, which I found very interesting.  I have no doubt we will discuss this further on Committee Stage.  I thank Senators for the broad support for these measures that is clearly evident.  As I said, 20 years ago the D&aacute;il and Seanad were united in regard to the establishment of CAB following the very tragic death of Veronica and it is appropriate to see that support here today, notwithstanding the various points that have been made by Senators regarding possible amendments.  I will address some of the points that have been made.<\/p> <p>On a general point, international co-operation was mentioned a number of times and is certainly very important.  A lot of international work is going on, to which I want to refer briefly.  Garda liaison officers are based in London, Paris, the Hague, Madrid and Lisbon and the Garda works very closely with both Interpol and Europol.  I have visited Europol and have seen the work it is doing.  At the recent Justice and Home Affairs Ministers meeting, one of the key focuses in terms of tackling, not just international criminal activity, but also terrorism was to do further work on the interoperability of the various databases that are being used by criminal justice agencies across Europe, a point referred to by various Senators.  It is very important we make progress on that.  It costs money, however, and there is a &euro;200 million investment programme in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in regard to those debates, which is also important.  At the last Justice and Home Affairs Ministers meeting, I met with the Justice Ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK to discuss dealing with the international face of gangland crime.  The point made by Senators in regard to dealing with these issues is very relevant.<\/p> <p>The issue of resources was raised.  Thankfully, with the improved economic situation we have been able to dedicate more resources to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have had extra recruitment and I hope to be in a position, depending on the budget processes later this year, to accelerate recruitment for Templemore in September in order that we have above and beyond the 600 garda&iacute; we are already training in the course of this year.  Further money is also going into Garda vehicles and the other support systems garda&iacute; need.  Of course, all of that is the backdrop to this legislation and is the kind of resourcing that is needed.  There was a period when resources were not being put in because of the economic situation, and I believe we are playing catch-up in a number of areas.<\/p> <p>I want to pay tribute to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The front-line work in confronting these gangs requires courage and serious commitment, which we are seeing.  I was asked about the armed response unit in Dublin.  Recruitment is under way, huge interest has been expressed by Garda members in this regard and they are currently being assessed and trained.  Several hundred garda&iacute; applied so there is huge interest in the armed support unit, even though it was said at the time there would not be.<\/p> <p>To go back to the details of the Bill, a number of Senators spoke about the ring-fencing of funds and said they would like to put down amendments.  I want to make a number of points for consideration before Committee Stage.  It is very unusual to ring-fence money for particular projects or communities as it tends to go into the general Exchequer fund, which is the normal way of dealing with it.  There was previous consultation with the Department of Finance on this point.  While I am not saying I would not be prepared to examine this to see what we might be able to do, it raises a number of practical difficulties, not least because of the variation in assets that are seized from one year to another.  Communities might be depending on the assets they get one year and, although they would want sustainable funding, they might not get it the next year.  There are practical issues that need to be considered if we were to ring-fence the funds in this way, primarily around the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the bureau in any given year.  In addition, potential delays through the possibility of legal challenge to court disposal orders could be problematic in terms of the provision of ongoing funding to community programmes.  We can tease out these practical difficulties when we are considering the detail of the Bill.  There is also an administrative cost.  As I said, it is very unusual from the point of view of collecting Exchequer money to ring-fence it for a particular issue.  It usually goes into the general fund and is then used as decided according to Government priorities at budget time.<\/p> <p>A number of points were made about reasonable grounds, in particular by Senator Ruane.  In legislation, the legal concept of \"reasonable grounds\" is well understood, and it obviously means what is objectively reasonable.  I would make the point that it will eventually be a matter for the High Court to decide on that.<\/p> <p>The goods seized can be a combination of goods, not just one item.  Safeguards are built in.  Senator Boyhan talked about the balances in the Bill and these have been very carefully considered.  With the CAB legislation, we have had to be very careful as there have been constitutional challenges, although the legislation has always been upheld.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell referred to an amendment in regard to the issue of gambling and illegal proceeds.  Gambling and money laundering legislation is due to deal with an EU directive, which might be a more appropriate place for that amendment.  We can discuss the issue further with the Senator.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for her support for the Bill.  She spoke about supporting communities, in particular children who have been affected, and about the two recent incidents.  I can only join with her in condemning those incidents.  This is why we have had to bring forward this kind of legislation to deal with the kind of violence that, unfortunately, we have seen in Lusk today and in other areas in recent days.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Frances Fitzgerald:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=401\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=401&amp;amp;pid=FrancesFitzgerald&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As both incidents are under investigation, I cannot make any comment on the connections or otherwise to earlier murders.  We do know, however, that there are gangs which are intent on having a cycle of revenge and retaliation.  To tackle them, we need all of the resources of the State, both practical and financial, that we give to the Garda, as well as stronger legislation.<\/p><p>The CAB has what it calls \"asset profilers\" around the country.  Senator Paul Daly spoke about rural areas.  I am very conscious of the need to support communities across the country in their efforts to deal with crime.  We have, for example, doubled the funding for Macra na Feirme for the local text messaging scheme.  Community involvement is very important in dealing with local criminal activity.  Equally, the asset profilers in the CAB are very often members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have good information on the situations about which the Senator talked where there is drug dealing.  They report back to the CAB and, where possible, there is an investigation and a prosecution.  This has been very helpful across the country in terms of the success of the CAB.<\/p><p>What I am presenting in the legislation is very much in line with the idea of having a mini-CAB which is more local.  Communities have stated to us that they want to see people who are dealing in drugs locally, perhaps in smaller amounts than the bigger international players, interrupted.  This is very important from the point of view of maintaining the morale of the community.  Where people are flaunting assets, we must be in a position to deal with them.<\/p><p>Senator Ivana Bacik spoke about an amendment she might bring forward.  We would have to look at it very carefully.  As she is well aware, the reason for inserting the period of 21 days is to allow the CAB to gather evidence to see if it can pursue its intention to confiscate the assets.  We will certainly examine any amendment she will bring forward, but it might be problematic.<\/p><p>I will conclude on that note.

I believe it is only right and proper that councillors' pay and terms are renegotiated.  This present operation is in being since 2014 and it is only settling down after the agreements that were put in place by the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan.  We can see now that it is not adequate at all to cover the expenses and the workings that councillors engage in on a daily and weekly basis.<\/p> <p>As a former member of a local authority for 25 years and as a town councillor for more than ten years, I know quite well the workings of local authorities, both town and county council.  I believe that great credit is due to anybody that puts his or her name forward to run for election to the local authorities.  When the people who had the courage to put their names down are elected, it is only right and proper that they are properly remunerated.  The pay of &euro;16,500 is not quite adequate in my view to cover the cost, particularly of somebody that is a full-time councillor.<\/p> <p>On the second day of this new Seanad, I put a motion down in relation to the K class.  I was heartened by the response from the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on the matter.  He outlined three areas in which he could see where improvements could be made to the K class.  The K class does not suit everybody.  It does not suit every councillor.  It does not suit some councillors to whom the benefits of the K class probably do not apply, be they over the pension age or whatever.  I believe it is only proper that the K class is addressed properly and that councillors who are young and not of pension age should get pay that entitles them to a contributory pension.  That is only right.  There are several instances in which the K class is being used right across the public service and the Civil Service where some benefits do accrue for some employees.  It is only right and proper that councillors get the contributory pension and the benefits that go with it.<\/p> <p>I welcome the motion before the House.  The Fine Gael Party welcomes it.  I believe that we have to work together whether from all parties or none to support councillors at this point in time and to make sure they receive proper pay and conditions.  Let us face it, they work long hours.  Working with council officials is tedious work.  Trying to get something done at council level is not always easy and is very time-consuming.  I believe that the proposal that is made here will help to put pressure on the various Ministers.  We see now that there are at least two Ministers involved in this.  The Minister for housing, planning and local government and the Minister for Social Protection are involved.<\/p> <p>It is not a simple solution and there are a number of offices to go through.  It is high time that proper conditions are put in place.  There is an urgency with it.  It should be addressed.  We agree with the all-party motion that is proposed.  We should have agreement on it and be able to go forward from here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070500002#OOO00500","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speech","time":1467725400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I will share my five minutes with Senator Craughwell.

There is no master-servant relationship between the council and the elected councillor.  The &euro;16,950 is a representational payment, not a salary.  Why in God's name are we treating it as such?  Class K PRSI is a criminal form of taking money from people for nothing.  Who in this room would buy an insurance policy knowing that he or she could never cash it in, draw down on it or make an input into it?  Hence, I have readied a case on this matter that will go to the High Court if we do not see a quick change.<\/p> <p>I hope that the committee we are agreeing to establish will set a timeline.  No Senator wants to face councillors in the next election and tell them that we let them down again.  I want us all to work together.  This is not any one individual's issue.  It is for all of us.  We will be damned quick to tell those who elected us that we worked on their behalf.

We recognise that Putting People First and the changes in local government have not served constituents, their councillors or local authorities.  Money was saved by getting rid of town councils, but it was a major mistake, not only for the towns that they served, but for the public representatives.  I have just left a constituency in west Mayo that is 100 miles long and includes a number of large towns.  There is no way for me to give a quality service in a constituency of that size.<\/p> <p>Local councillors need the resources to do their jobs.  It is more than a full-time job.  We all bring our experiences to it.  I did not realise that Senator Paddy Burke had been a councillor for 25 years before me.  We all know what we put into that job when we did it.<\/p> <p>There must be fixed-term contracts with the associated benefits.  Some people believe that councillors should do the job for nothing, but one cannot do so with no resources.  My main concern is that someone who is parenting alone or has responsibilities and who could bring good experience to a council chamber is forbidden from doing so because it is financially unaffordable for him or her to leave a family in a vulnerable situation and work so many hours.  People are unable to take up extra employment or pay their bills at the end of the month.  We need people from all cross-sections of the community in our council chambers, for example, lone parents, people who have experienced poverty, people who have run businesses, etc.  These are the types of persons who make good decisions on behalf of the people.<\/p> <p>When we treat councillors as we have been doing, we feed into the centralisation of power in the Government and county managers.  The latter are running the show in local authorities.  That is not right.  Reserved functions are being continuously eroded.  Is that any wonder when we treat councillors like we do?  We must be able to encourage a cross-section of society into local government, but we can only do that by looking after the welfare and terms and conditions of our councillors.  We must work together in that regard.

Many delicate negotiations will have to take place, predominantly with the Minister.  The previous Seanad's group met the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, with the representative associations to discuss these issues.  We cannot negotiate on the floor of the House.  Negotiations must be done with the respective people on both sides.  We have made a serious statement on behalf of councillors in what we have done this evening.  We need a timeline.  Councillors' rates of pay must be addressed given the surveys showing how much work councillors do and how many meetings they must attend, including those that are not council meetings.  If one attends two community-based meetings per night, one does not sign anywhere to prove one's attendance.<\/p> <p>Many issues must be clarified, but much work has already been done and we do not need to reinvent the wheel.  The 2014 legislation was reviewed and, on 6 April, the then Minister tabled a proposal as a starting point to increase the annual allowance and change it to an administrative assistance payment to reflect its purpose more correctly.  We must get the current Minister to buy into what has been done in this regard.  Then we need to consider councillors' rates of pay and the PRSI issue.  I commend a former Minister for social protection, Dr. Michael Woods, on introducing a new class of PRSI for Protestant ministers, of whom there are 300 or 400.  There are approximately 1,000 councillors.  Surely we could come up with something to sort out this issue.  As Senator Paddy Burke stated, it is a complicated one.  I met a councillor of pension age in Leinster House last week who was still paying 4% of his councillor's allowance into a pension even though he was already getting it.  That is daft.<\/p> <p>The Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, have met the Minister and laid out their stall which entailed something similar to Senator Boyhan's four points.
