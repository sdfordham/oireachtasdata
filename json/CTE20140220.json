This is to be noted and published.

I refer also to No. 3A.7, which is an exchange of correspondence between Professor Noel Whelan and Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien of the HSE regarding the compliance issue.  In these letters there is a new commitment that St. Vincent's hospital will be fully compliant at 31 March 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014022000004#C01000","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1392891000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I am willing to wait for the process to unfold and I welcome the belated willingness of St. Vincent's to be compliant by 31 March.  However, as I said to you previously, we have had a number of meetings with the HSE in which we have been concerned about public pay policy but we have also been concerned about the protection of taxpayers' money within certain section 38 agencies.  While this exercise being undertaken by the HSE is worthy, it is only concerned with public sector pay.  Taking St. Vincent's as an example, when its representatives appeared before this committee, serious concerns were expressed about their complete and utter disregard for the consultants' contract and the fact that the public hospital is losing significant sums of money.  I and other members have received correspondence from doctors, consultants, patients and nurses outlining the situation.  To give one brief example, a doctor admitted a private patient to St. Vincent's Private Hospital, and then transferred the patient to the public hospital.  The patient had an implantable pain management device inserted.  The patient did not pay the private fees into the public system, and the public system was deprived of the money.  A patient, whom I will not name, had an implantable device inserted costing thousands of euro.  She was a private patient at a private hospital, but she was transferred to the public hospital to have the surgery.  Basically, no bill was paid to the public hospital for a device costing more than &euro;20,000.  There is also the fact that St. Vincent's still has not rectified the situation whereby it has the same corporate governance crossover of directorships as the CRC had in respect of the Friends and Supporters of the CRC fund-raising group.  The four directors on the St. Vincent's Foundation are all directors on the St. Vincent's board.  I am happy to wait for the process to be completed, but that is one example in St. Vincent's.<\/p><p>  We have discussed the National Maternity Hospital with Mr. Tony O'Brien, the director general.  We read again in today's newspapers that there is a serious issue there.  There is an allegation that a clinic, of which some members of senior management of the National Maternity Hospital are directors, is being given preferential treatment by the National Maternity Hospital, again at a potential cost to the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  The remit of this committee is to ensure the public funds going into these institutions are safeguarded.  It is all well and good for the HSE to go through this process, but it only relates to one aspect of what we have been discussing for months.  I realise the HSE and Rehab representatives will appear before the committee next week, but perhaps some time could be set aside to discuss these other issues.  It is not just a case of the CEO earning the right salary now so we can tick that box and say the job is done.

Next week, the representatives of Rehab will appear before the committee.  We have already decided to invite the previous CEO and the remuneration committee to get the other information that is required by the committee.  Deputy O'Donnell raised the issue of the report and so forth, and attention has been drawn to the accounts.  That will take us the full day next Thursday, probably morning and afternoon, because there will be three Accounting Officers before the committee as well.<\/p><p>  The issues you raise, Deputy Harris, are so serious that they require another exchange with representatives of St. Vincent's, the National Maternity Hospital and the HSE.  That can be done on another day.  While we might get an update next week, the two issues are such that, linked with the matter of St. Michael's House raised by Deputy Dowds, they require three separate sittings.  That might require the committee to sit on both Tuesday and Thursday of some weeks, but we will have to do that if you wish to go into that detail.  I believe we should and I support the case you are making.

The summary was good, but we wrote to NAMA again requesting further details because in that correspondence regarding the summary, which we received on 22 January, it talked about very high satisfaction rates.  The rates for \"satisfied\" and \"very satisfied\" add up to 95%, which is similar to the previous year.  I do not know if it is a good or bad thing that it would be so similar and so high, but it also referred to some feedback that was not positive and that would potentially require attention, such as the desirability of continuing to have a mix of expertise and skills on the board, the strategic balance, Government information issues with regard to the board and a number of the issues that have arisen when we discuss NAMA ourselves and also in correspondence that we get from the public about concerns with regard to NAMA.  When the report was presented to the board, it was anonymous, so one could not identify an individual person's comments to protect them and to protect the integrity of the process.

Exchequer tax revenue increased in 2012 by around &euro;2.4 billion, or 7%, to &euro;36.5 billion.  There was a significant shift between PRSI and income tax receipts in 2011 and 2012, following the introduction of the universal social charge.<\/p><p>  Chapter 24 reviews Revenue&rsquo;s debt collection function and the trends in the value, status and age of outstanding debt arising from assessed tax liabilities.  The overall debt at the end of March each year from 2010 to 2013 remained stable at around &euro;2 billion.  Revenue has improved its debt management system through the introduction of an arrears case analysis tool, which now provides better information on the level and composition of debt.   At the end of March 2013, more than 40% of the debt was regarded by Revenue as being currently non-collectible, mainly due to the debt being under appeal.  Around a quarter of the debt was subject to enforcement action, and payment agreements were in place for a further 6%.  The remaining 29% was deemed collectible, but was not subject to enforcement or collection efforts at the end of March 2013.  For 2012, Revenue set itself a business target to reduce the level of collectible debt by 22%.  We found that this was an overly ambitious target.  The actual reduction achieved in 2012 was just 2%.  The target set by Revenue for 2013 was a reduction of 4%.<\/p><p>  Corporation tax losses are dealt with in Chapter 26 which outlines matters relating to trading losses used by companies to obtain relief from the payment of corporation tax on other profits.  Prior to 2011, Revenue did not have a record of the trading losses accumulated by companies.  Revenue amended the tax return form for 2011 to require companies to provide additional information on losses carried forward from earlier accounting periods.  Arising from this change, Revenue now has better information to use in its tax forecasting work. <\/p><p>  The total losses and allowances of around &euro;205 billion available for offset in 2011 were highly concentrated in a small number of companies.  Financial institutions participating in NAMA accounted for around a third of the total, or about &euro;67 billion.  There are restrictions on the rate at which these losses may be used to reduce future tax liabilities.  Seven other companies in the financial and insurance sector accounted for a further &euro;31 billion, or 15% of outstanding losses and allowances.<\/p><p>  Revenue estimates that losses and allowances of around &euro;23 billion were used in 2011 resulting in a reduction of around &euro;2.8 billion in corporation tax receipts in that year.  It has estimated that a further &euro;183 billion of losses and capital allowances remained unused at the end of the year.  The extent to which the amount carried forward will have an impact on future corporation tax receipts depends on the profits earned by the companies.<\/p><p>  Chapter 25 outlines Revenue&rsquo;s approach to monitoring and managing taxpayer compliance.  Revenue undertakes a range of compliance interventions, including two tax audit programmes.  Under its random audit programme, Revenue carries out around 400 audits of randomly selected individual taxpayers and business annually.  The results of the audits for the years 2008 to 2011, almost all of which have been completed, show that, consistently, around one third of taxpayers under-declare their tax liability.  The average yield for completed 2011 audits where the taxpayer was non-compliant was over &euro;11,000 per case.  The 2012 audits had not all been completed, so final outturn figures were not available for that year.  The Revenue&rsquo;s overall losses as a result of non-compliance by registered taxpayers is referred to as the audit gap.  Revenue does not produce estimates of the gap.  <\/p><p>  We have pointed out in the past that the results of comprehensive random audits can be used to provide an estimate of the audit gap, by comparing the yield from the random audits with those taxpayers&rsquo; full assessed liabilities.  The 2011 random audits suggest that registered taxpayers may have underpaid their liabilities by an estimated 3.1% in the reference year.  It should be noted that this does not include any losses of revenue from activity by agents that are completely outside the tax system, operating in the black economy.    <\/p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s main compliance work is its programme of risk-based tax audit.  The results of this programme indicate that Revenue&rsquo;s detection work is generally well-targeted.  In 2012, almost 70% of the risk-based audits resulted in identification of additional tax due &ndash; that is about double the non-compliance rate for the random sample.  The average yield from risk-based audits was just under &euro;60,000 per case.  However, we noted that the number of risk-based audits fell by around 20% in 2012 compared with 2011, continuing a downward trend in the level of audit activity. <\/p><p>  Chapter 27 notes that 20% of a sample of tax settlement cases reviewed by my office had been incorrectly classified as audits, and were in fact other non-audit interventions.  As a result, it is likely that the reported total audit yield of &euro;359 million in 2012 was significantly overstated.  Revenue has pointed out that it began refining the classification of its compliance interventions during 2012. <\/p><p>  Chapter 27 focuses on audit settlements reached by Revenue with taxpayers.  The review examined in detail the process applied in reaching settlements in 45 audit cases closed by Revenue in 2012.  The sample comprised the four cases with the highest settlements in the year, and 41 cases selected at random.  As stated earlier, nine of the cases, including one of the largest cases, had been incorrectly recorded as audit interventions. The remaining 36 cases involved audits that resulted in a yield of &euro;41.4 million.<\/p><p>  For most of the cases reviewed, the examination found that Revenue had followed its published settlement procedures and that interest and penalties had been applied in accordance with legislation.  However, there was insufficient evidence on file to indicate how the taxpayer&rsquo;s liability had been calculated in 18% of the cases examined.  Interest had been incorrectly applied or not applied at all in a small number of cases.  In a third of the cases examined, the level of penalties imposed was lower than the files indicated they should have been.  Analysis of all audit settlements reached in 2012 showed that interest and penalties were applied in just over half of the cases managed by the large cases division.  In contrast, interest and penalties were charged on over three quarters of the settlement cases managed in the regions.  The Accounting Officer stated that the nature of the taxpayers managed by the large cases division, mainly large corporates, means that the issues identified which gave rise to the settlement can often relate to technical adjustments which do not result in a penalty. <\/p><p>The chapter recommended that Revenue should review the mechanisms it has in place to ensure that interest and penalties are quantified in accordance with legislation and with the code of practice for Revenue audit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014022000006#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392892800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Chapter 23 which deals with tax collection, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, shows Exchequer revenue in 2012 at &euro;36.5 billion.  The figure for 2013 is &euro;37.8 billion, some &euro;6 billion higher than for 2010 which was the worst year in recent times.<\/p><p>  In relation to debt management, as I have said before to the committee, the change in the amount of outstanding tax debt over time can give us some insights into the financial circumstances of taxpayers.  The debt is expressed by Revenue as a performance measure by comparing it with the gross tax collected.  As expected, the resulting ratio increased, from a low of 2% in 2007 to 4% in 2009.  It was still at 4% in March 2013.  However, I anticipate that it will show an improvement when we next measure the debt at the end of next month.<\/p><p>  On the compliance side, as the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledged, we have active risk based programmes.  I circulated in advance to committee members our headline results for 2013.  On the subject of compliance, they may also be aware that we will shortly be rolling out a structured and focused local property tax compliance programme, but before we do, we are giving property owners a final chance to avoid interest and penalties.  In that context, I have also furnished for the information of the committee some LPT statistics which have just been published to coincide with this campaign.<\/p><p>  Let me add something that is not in the paper circulated.  For the committee's information, in relation to losses, in his opening remarks the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the fact that there were restrictions on the uses of losses, which, of course, was the correct position when the report was compiled, but that is no longer the case.  Since the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, that restriction has been removed.

We have had to do a lot of work in the past six months to remove duplicates to try to make sure we are matching properly.  For example, up to about three weeks ago, I would have said there were 40,000 or 50,000 properties that we had not matched.  We have got that figure down to 17,000.  However, we do not have confidence in the 460,000 number because the databases were so different, as was the approach taken.  That is another message we need to get out.  If there are people who have paid the household charge and if, when they look at their LPT record on line - I have been getting questions about this - they see they are &euro;200 in arrears, that means that for a variety of reasons that I can discuss with the Deputy we do not know they paid the household charge.

Trading losses are a feature of business life.  Businesses have losses all of the time.  The tax system recognises this for various taxes and it allows businesses to offset losses against subsequent profits in the same trade or business.  It is standard.  The recognition of losses in the tax system exists throughout the world.  All this states is because of the huge changes in the economy in 2008 and 2009 significant losses got onto the balance sheets of big business, in particular financial institutions.  These losses are available for offsetting against corporate tax whenever and if ever they return to profitability.  Losses are not money we can collect.  In financial terms, they are a deferred tax asset.  It means when the company comes back into profitability and makes a profit it can offset its losses and pay no tax that year.

I refer to circumstances in which the Revenue Commissioners write randomly to a business or taxpayer stating it or he or she is to be audited, or in which they target a certain sector of industry in which there may be a greater propensity for tax evasion or avoidance.  The results of the audits were interesting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General examined 45 cases out of over 9,000.  Even in these randomly selected 45 cases, there are errors in classification, in how how interest was applied, a lack of documentation in the files and no great evidence of how decisions were made.  It is difficult to ascertain exactly how the process was engaged in.<\/p><p>  Let me start with the easy point, namely, that 20% of the cases were misidentified.  They are included as settlements, but they had nothing at all to do with audits; they were voluntary disclosures.  How did this happen?  How did 20% of the cases end up being misfiled or mislabelled?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014022000010#J00600","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392894600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the compliment.  Let me go back a little.  We all found this chapter really interesting.  Our approach to audit settlements and other interventions has been evolving.  Every year we take another look to determine whether we can improve the recording and the way we do our work.  Ten years ago circumstances were entirely different.  We now have a code of practice that is published.  It has changed several times in the timeframe.  Our IT systems and staff have changed.  We are in a position in which our approach to how we do our work is constantly being examined.  We were already having conversations among ourselves about the classification issue when the Comptroller and Auditor General did this work.  We had drafted some quality guidelines.  More important, we had redesigned our case management system.  That is reflected in this instance.  The case management system now has a much richer, more granular classification.  One should put oneself in the position of the auditor or the Revenue official whose job is to do compliance work on a risk basis and get into cases.  We did not have a mechanism for having everything recorded or classified.  Approximately ten years ago we were carrying out what we called 16,000 audits, approximately.  We are now carrying out 9,000.  That represents classification more than anything else.  It is because we have provided for other types of intervention which we have codified and made available to our staff to capture and classify in their work.<\/p><p>  The more important point &ndash; I acknowledge that the Deputy says this is the easy one &ndash; is that the money was collected.

As an organisation, we did not have the granularity of tools available to our staff to classify the different ways.

One of the quality assurance measures we have introduced - it took us a while to retool the IT system that came in with effect from last July - is that, on a random basis, 2% of all audit settlements, irrespective of who approves them, will come to one or other of the commissioners for a final sign-off.  Principally, what we are looking at is quality and asking questions.  I have disapproved of a couple on the grounds that they should not have been audits.  They should have been something else and there was money collected.  One is trying to change an organisation and people who recorded things in a certain way in the past.  It is a matter of giving them tools, guidance and a framework.

Figure 27.4 is very interesting.  It gives a regional breakdown of where interest and penalties were applied in 2012.  The Revenue Commissioners have a large cases division that deals with significant tax issues.  It also has a regional issues division, with which we are familiar from our constituencies.  I refer to the local tax office, for example.  If there is a large case with a lot of money involved, the individual concerned is much less likely to be charged interest and penalties than a small person in the regions or an individual not involved with serious money.  The figures are stark.  We see that a figure of 55% in interest and penalties was applied to the large cases, compared to an average figure of 75% or 76% in smaller cases.  We see that, as a total proportion of the revenue taken in, only 6% is from penalties in the large cases, whereas the figure is 20% to 25% in smaller cases.

We had already published internally draft audit quality guidelines in mid-2012.  Those quality guidelines had been reinforced in 2013 by introducing stronger oversight with cases coming randomly to assistant secretaries and also to commissioners, including cases that might have been signed off at those levels.  The machine will randomly send a number of them to somebody else for review.  We have also connected the quality compliance standards with the performance management system for our staff.  We have had two extensive discussions at MAC to reinforce the importance of quality and record keeping and evidence.  There is no question but we take the evidence issue very seriously.

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has visited a number of these areas to see the effects the severe weather has had on farmers.

He has reassured farmers that both he and the Department will do everything possible to assist them. <\/p><p>  With regard to inspections, in particular, an issue in which I know the committee is interested, the Department will take a common-sense approach and farmers need not be worried or concerned on this front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014022000003#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392891300,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I understand we are dealing with both issues.  I thank the delegates for attending and the clarification provided.  However, what I am experiencing on the ground is slightly different from what has been presented, to which I will come shortly.<\/p><p>  There are two major issues, the first of which relates to flooding.  Huge areas of land are flooded and, in many cases, this flooding could continue for a considerable time.  Will it be accepted that it is a case of <i>force majeure<\/i> in these areas that continue to be flooded for a period of months in regard to the seven month rule under the disadvantaged area scheme?  As each month passes, the position becomes more and more difficult and some of these areas could be flooded for a considerable time.<\/p><p>  I know slurry spreading is primarily an issue for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, but no doubt it tic-tacs with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which always cites Teagasc as the source for what we call &quot;calendar farming&quot;.  I asked a parliamentary question about slurry spreading dates and in the response I was informed slurry could be spread at that moment.  However, in many places farmers would be spreading it in water causing serious pollution.  Up until mid-December, we had had a particularly dry season, but farmers were not allowed to empty their tanks and spread slurry.  Many farmers have slurry tanks filled to capacity.  Now that there is much better forecasting, is consideration being given to moving away from rote calendar farming which in our climate does not have major relevance in terms of when land will be dry or wet?  Are we going to move to a system under which slurry can be spread when conditions are suitable, when land is at its driest, particularly in view of the fact that most farmers only have limited storage capacity and that if there is a long wet spell, their tanks will be filled to overflowing?  While they might be legally entitled to spread slurry at such a time, it would be at great risk of causing pollution.<\/p><p>  I note what was said about inspections and, presumably, what was said was related to REPS and AEOS inspections and the 2013 single farm payment.  However, I understand the relevant period has passed and that once a farmer had the land in good agricultural condition for the summer, the inspection does not matter because if the land has disappeared under water in the meantime, it could make no difference.<\/p><p>  It is stated in the presentation that there have been individual reports of storm damage to coastal lands and loss of fodder on a small number of farms.  Perhaps my constituency is different, but the majority of farmers in my constituency have land in coastal areas.  The bigger farmers are in the core of Connemara, but the majority are along the coast because that is where the green strips of land are.  The majority of the population in Connemara are in these areas.  From the time one leaves Bearna through Spiddal, Inverin, An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, Cill Chiar&aacute;in, Carna, Roundstone, Ballyconneeley, Errislannan, Clifden and Renvyle, as well as the island, areas that face west or south west suffered damage.  There is a continuous strip of damage all along the coast and thousands of farmers are affected.  Therefore, it is wrong to say only some individual farmers are affected.  I have files and could show the officials the information I have available.<\/p><p>  There has been huge damage on the islands, some of which has been seen on television, but what has been seen on television is the damage done to public property, not to farmers' lands.  Along the coast, in places never affected previously, walls in existence for 100 or 200 years or more - stone walls in many cases, not post and wire fences - have been knocked down.  Worse still, the sea came in and flotsam and jetsam of every kind were thrown on the land, including many stones from d&uacute;irling or pebble beaches.  The land has been destroyed and stripped back in some places as one would roll back a carpet.  The rebuilding of these walls will require a major effort which will certainly not be made by 15 May.  That is the real issue in regard to what will happen next.  This means that farms will not be in compliance with the terms of either the DAS or the single farm payment scheme which requires a farm to be fenced. <\/p><p>  There is another issue.  As land has been lost to the sea or destroyed by it and it is impossible to provide forage by the end of the year, will maps have to be adjusted and, as a consequence, will people wind up with more entitlements than land?  Is it possible to stack these entitlements for them?  In other words, will the Department rejig their entitlements based on the reduced amount of land which was beyond anybody's control?  Alternatively, is it suggesting they will have to get more land, even though there is no more available, or that they will have to sell their entitlements?  This would be an expensive exercise because everyone must have his or her land measured.<\/p><p>  I have made a suggestion to the Minister for Social Protection and I am making the same suggestion today because no doubt the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine tic-tacs with that Department.  It will be beyond the ability of many of these farmers to rebuild these walls on their own because they were built in the old days when there was plenty of help available.  I suggest that in view of the large number of farmers in receipt of farm assist payments, the rural social scheme be expanded for a 12-month period to enable people participating in that scheme to be employed to replace all of the coastal walls lost, not with post and rail fencing which would be a simple and cost effective way for a farmer to replace them but with the stone walls that are a characteristic feature on the west coast.  However, to do this the creation of new foundations would be required and it would not be as simple a job as it sounds.  These walls were built on green land which is no longer there.  In this situation there would be a double win.  We would provide employment for farmers who need it and preserve the heritage value of the walls.  The walls in each area have a unique style, which it is important to preserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014022000005#D00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392891900,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I have had many calls from farmers around the Maugherow and Mullaghmore areas in Sligo.

Most of these areas are SACs, special area of conservation, and SPAs, special protection area, and farmers are unclear as to what they can do with repairing embankments on them.  They simply cannot get an answer to this.  It is indicative of a fragmented approach by various Departments.  This has not been going on for the past several weeks but goes back 30 years with various Departments pussyfooting around this, disowning responsibility for culverts, in particular, and embankments.  Farmers are quite prepared to repair these themselves, if they think they could without being penalised.  They all have detailed maps setting out what is and is not in a SPA and SAC, yet, they still cannot get a clear answer as to what they can do on them.<\/p><p>  Which Department is responsible for this?  I have correspondence going back to former Ministers, Brendan Daly, Noel Treacy and John Wilson, on this matter.  I do not mention them because they are all Fianna F&aacute;il.

Each year, many affected farmers get paid when this occurs.  In the cases of the seven-month rule and flooded lands, the Department will take a sympathetic approach when assessing them at payment time in September 2014.<\/p><p>  We have to look at land that is lost and land that is temporarily lost as separate matters.  The decisions recently made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the implementation of the basic payment scheme will assist farmers affected.  In the first instance, the number of entitlements a farmer will hold under the basic payment scheme in 2015 onwards is the number of eligible hectares he or she declared in 2013 and 2015 if lower.  That means that land that is lost permanently will not be declared in 2105 and, therefore, that farmer will fully protected under the new regime.  There is also a second element of protection.  This week, the Minister announced he will use the value of the payment entitlements owned on 15 May 2014 to calculate the value of the basic payment from 2015 onwards.  This means that if a farmer did not have enough land in 2014 to obtain the full payment, they will still get the benefit of the full value of their entitlements in the new calculation for 2015.<\/p><p>  I note in the media that farmers with surplus entitlements are being encouraged to dispose of them.  My advice would be to think very carefully about this because the value of those will be built into their new payment for at least seven years.<\/p><p>  As for the protections for 2014, we have to look at land that is lost and land that is temporarily lost as separate matters.  For land that has been damaged by the recent storms and will not be properly back in agricultural use by 15 May 2014, the principle of <i>force majeure<\/i> will have to apply and farmers will get payment.  As Dr. Smyth said, the Department will take a pragmatic approach to these cases.  The second element is land that is permanently lost which has happened in several counties.  There will be no issue from 2015 onwards and the farmers will be fully protected.

The LPIS process is causing huge grief.  The major problem with the 2013 maps is that many of the features being picked out involve 0.01 ha or 0.02 ha.  Some of it is a matter of opinion with regard to whether it is scrub with no grass growing on it and therefore not forage.  Many farmers dispute this.  The Department may state that an area is 50% or 80% scrub but a farmer will state it is 20% scrub and the rest of it can be grazed at times of the year over the required period.  The statement that a farmer knew and it was on the forms is fairly simplistic and does not reflect the reality.  Most farmers did not have methods or ways of measuring down to 0.01 ha and in many cases relied on measurements taken many years ago relating to land registry maps.<\/p><p>  There is a further issue to which the witnesses alluded.  They spoke about the fact that between 2004 and 2006 all of the land was reviewed, and significant reviews also took place in 2007 and 2008.  Most farmers thought if they were not written to it was not because they had not been reviewed but because everything was in order.  When they received the form they were asked by the planner whether any changes had occurred.  They stated they had not, that they had the same land as they did last year when everything seemed to be in order, and they sent back the forms.  If we were speaking about a significant amount of land, such as 2 ha, 5 ha or 10 ha, one could state that a farmer could not miss it, but we are arguing about farm roads and rocks, which are hard for a farmer to measure.  The big issues are farm roads, rocks and scrub.  In many cases farmers would dispute how much rocky land is not grazable in the summer and they would certainly dispute this with regard to many areas now declared as scrub.<\/p><p>  Some of the maps are not square on the land.  When the Minister came before the committee I had a copy of a map on which one could see parts of the green land were outside the line and parts of the strand were inside it.  The lady with the farm in question had 3 ha.  Ten percent of 3 ha is 0.3 ha and 3% is 0.03 ha.  This is where penalties come in because once it goes over 3% one is penalised by three times the amount of land on which one is meant to have over-claimed.  When this is multiplied by five years - one might argue the rocks were there all the time or the scrub is no different, and I will not disagree with this - one finds that people who happily took and spent the cheques are facing huge fines.  I know of cases where the fine amounts to 3% multiplied by three, as the penalty is 9%, then multiplied by five, which is 45% of one year's payment.  It is quite devastating.  I have asked the Department for figures on this because it seems it will disproportionately hit farmers with very small farms on very poor land with a large amount of rocks which are not so productive, because the percentage game means it is easier to make an error and be tripped into the penalty regime of 3% on a small holding than on a significant holding.<\/p><p>  Has the Department reviewed the 132,000 applicants?  My figures suggest there are 120,000 single farm payment applicants, and I wonder from where the extra 12,000 come.  Have they all been reviewed at this stage?  Do we know, in rough terms, what percentage had no cut, what percentage had a cut of less than 3% with just a deduction in the land, what percentage had a cut of between 3% and 20% with all of the penalties attached, and what percentage was ruled out completely because the error was over 20%?  Do we know how they relate to the size of farms?  Are the vast majority of the people getting caught on very small farms because it is much easier to make a small error?  It is very hard to miss a hectare but not so hard to miss a very small part of a hectare.  Do we have this information, and can we relate it to farm size to see what is happening?  If it is predominantly on very small farms, the total amount of over-claimed land about which Europe might be concerned would be very small; 3.5% of 10 ha is a very small amount of land compared to 3.5% of 100 ha or 1,000 ha.<\/p><p>  I have a big objection to the retrospective element of this.  Farmers sent in the forms in good faith believing they had been checked, that no change had been made and that they were in order.  It came as a total surprise to them to find that, with no change in their farming, they were being slapped with a five-year penalty.  How many of the 132,000 farmers will receive retrospective penalties for the five years?<\/p><p>  It was stated that the amount involved was &euro;1 million, or an average of &euro;100 per annum.  Does this mean the total overpayment was &euro;1 million with regard to all of the farmers in Ireland?  Is it an average of &euro;100 per farm per annum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014022000008#G00600","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392893700,"counter":642,"content":"<p>Farmers were penalised for having scrub.

However, the big issue is that a contractual arrangement was entered into with farmers.  It was subject to a review in the mid-2000s and everybody thought everything was hunky-dory.  Farmers are entitled to have a legitimate expectation, and that is a European principle as well, that all was fine and dandy, but now they are being hit with this.  I saw some of the stuff that was sent out.  I saw some of the maps excluding an area of land where the man lives - his house is on it.  I wrote in about it, but I do not know whether it was corrected.  I was absolutely astounded.  This is a big area of land in the Ballymore area of Westmeath.  As a result of this, he did not have the correct area of land.  He said to me, \"This is where I live, as you know\".  I knew that and I was astounded by it.  Some of the areas that were coming out were bounded by the lines, but this area did not appear to be bounded.  That led to a misconception, in my view.  I did not hear anything back so it probably was corrected, although it might not have been.  That is the type of thing that drives people mad, when they think that they have made everything they have submitted correct and they have done so over a number of years.  It is causing real angst.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is correct.  If there is a small area of land and the penalty is trebled and so forth, it has a huge impact.  Does the appeal system allow for an oral hearing, or is it just a documentary, evidential hearing?  Is it like the normal appeals system that was established in 2006 - the witnesses will know that I was deeply involved with and interested in that - or is it just the submission of documentary evidence?  A person who feels aggrieved should be entitled to give oral evidence, backed up by whatever professional he or she brings to ensure that their case is adequately presented and that there is no ambiguity about the point they are making in terms of the corrections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014022000009#H00400","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392893700,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Paud Evans will deal with some of the detailed areas that have been mentioned.  I will put this in the overall context.  The Commission auditors are coming over to us next month and, basically, they want to close off five years of audits for Ireland.  They have done it to many other member states.  They have visited the state, looked at the LPIS system and in virtually all the member states the Commission is not happy with the land parcel identification system.  It has introduced a series of disallowances for member states and has taken massive amounts of money from those states.  It has taken &pound;240 million from England, &pound;80 million from Northern Ireland and it is threatening the French with a three-year disallowance of 5%, which will amount to &euro;1.1 billion.  That is the position.<\/p><p>  There are two ways in which we can deal with this.  The Commission has identified weaknesses in our system and it wants some of its money back.  It says the system has not been operated properly.  It is particularly worried about the way we have been dealing with ineligible features.  It is telling us we have two choices.  We can take the disallowance route and the disallowance can be 2%, 5% or 10%.  Over five years a 2% disallowance would be approximately &euro;160 million.  That is the minimum disallowance.  It could be 5%, which is &euro;400 million.<\/p><p>  The other way of dealing with it, which is the approach we are taking and which is relatively innovative, is to look at every land parcel in the country and take out all the ineligible features.  That will result in a more personalised approach, in the sense that we will identify individual farmers.  We will also be able to quantify what the risk to the fund was.  We will say where the problems were and we will show them.  We have done much of that work.  The Commission is coming over and I do not wish to talk about figures until it has verified our work, but we are hoping that by taking that approach, the bill will be much smaller.  However, money is owed to the European Union, and there is no way out of that.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about percentages.  Just over 70% of farmers do not have a problem.  They have either put in the right area or they claimed a lesser area, so they cannot be accused of over-claiming.  They have allowed for it.  Approximately 20% of farmers have an ineligible area of less than 3%.  They will not be penalised on that.  The area will simply be taken away.  This is the 2,500 farmers we mentioned and the &euro;1 million in that regard.  Then we get to the problem area.  Approximately 6% of farmers have an over-claim of between 3% and 20%.  There are penalties arising from that.<\/p><p>  Finally, there is a category of 400 farmers who have an over-claim of over 20%.  The problem under the EU rules, and they are very strict and brutal, is that once one has an over-claim of over 20% one is entitled to no payment whatsoever.  It is that simple.  An over-claim of over 20% means no payment, and there are 400 of those cases.  These are the cases we have prioritised.  I referred to the verification checks.  We have checked them out both by getting our best people to look at the maps to see if there is any way to get the percentage down, and by sending inspectors just to look at the farm and see if there is anything there, for example, different types of scrub where we can make a difference and try to get the figures down.  That is what we are dealing with at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014022000009#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Smyth"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392893700,"counter":646,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the number of applicants.

Most of them are in receipt of the disadvantaged areas scheme payment or REPS, now AEOS, or possibly the organic scheme payment.  There are 132,000 farmers on our database making an application in 2013 with eligible land.  Many of those will get entitlements if they were farming in 2013 under the new regime, so they will be in receipt of the basic payment from 2015 onwards.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the map he showed the Minister during the discussion on the Estimates.  We have looked at that map and it is accurate.  There is an issue in our system.  We started digitising in 1995 or 1996 using the Ordnance Survey map.  A great deal of work has been done on that database since then and there is what is known as a nudge issue with the lines one might see.  We can correct it most of the time when we are printing the map.  However, when one is working on the system, one might see the digitised line perhaps inside the fence whereas it is gone onto the road on the other side.

In that particular case, it did not.<\/p><p>  The review that was undertaken went on for a number of years, from 2007 to 2009.  That was a limited review.  We did not have the technology we have now to be able to go through 900,000 parcels in a few months and it was entirely based on risk.  It was based on farmers whom we asked in 2008 to tell us where the farm hub was.  We identified farmers or applicants who told us the farm hub was in a parcel on which they were claiming 100%.

A farmer does not have a digital system to measure all of these elements so it is unfair to set him back five years.  I do not have a huge problem with the small adjustments for the current year.

The farmer had no way of measuring and that is where the retrospective aspect is unfair.  The common perception, be it right or wrong, was that the Department had checked the details and once a farmer got the payment he or she was in the clear.  Everybody in rural Ireland would have thought that once the Department approved claims and made payments to farmers it was not possible that the claims could be wrong and the Department could claim the money back five years later.

We have received apologies from Senator Aideen Hayden.  I remind everyone to turn off mobile telephones and iPads as they will interfere with the recording equipment.  Putting them on silent is not good enough.<\/p><p>  The first item on today's agenda is a discussion on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's review of foreign policy and external relations.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Marie Cross, the former assistant secretary at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Dr. Pat Ivory, the head of EU and international development at IBEC.  Dr. Ivory is accompanied by Mr. Erik O'Donovan, Ms Paula O'Dwyer and Mr. Adrian Farrell.  The joint committee has considered the Department's review of foreign policy and trade.  We look forward to hearing our witnesses' views on this issue.  Today we have the opportunity to hear two very distinct voices on these issues.  D. Pat Ivory, the head of EU and international development at IBEC was previously the director of the Irish Dairy Industries Association and assistant director of Food and Drink Industry Ireland.  Ms Marie Cross is a former assistant secretary at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and during her long career in that Department, she served as Ireland's ambassador to the Czech Republic and as ambassador and representative of Ireland to the Political and Security Committee of the European Union.  Ms Cross is currently the chairperson of the Future of Europe Group at the Institute of International and European Affairs.<\/p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way that he, she or it could be identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are asked to respect the practice that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>  As agreed, I now invite Ms Cross to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000002#A00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392904800,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on the review of foreign policy in the context of the exercise under way.  I hope that I can be of use in providing some information of relevant to the committee.  I will perhaps concentrate, in my remarks, on the implementation of foreign policy and the means of most effective engagement in my experience.<\/p><p>  For a small country we have a very high profile on the international scene for reasons of history, heritage and culture.  It is striking, as a representative abroad, how the long arm of history, that dates back to the Christian monks who left Ireland, missionaries in Africa and more recently emigration from Ireland and the migrants who had great success internationally, is of considerable advantage to us both bilaterally and in a multilateral context.  It is of very valuable assistance in representing the State abroad.  <\/p><p>  As an EU member we have the opportunity to promote our interests on a wider stage, to act with partners and to ally ourselves with a Union which has the capacity, to a greater extent now than ever, to influence international events in the political, economic and the development area and, with the EU's so-called comprehensive approach, it covers all of these areas. <\/p><p>  Within the EU, our strengths are our history, our international profile on issues, particularly in the humanitarian and disarmament issues, and our willingness to back up our commitment with practical support such as our contribution to military and civilian peacekeeping missions, our aid programme and our willingness to mobilise other countries to support our efforts in this regard.  <\/p><p>  The challenge we face in the EU - or I suppose it can be more appropriately phrased as \"the reality\" - is that we are a small member state within a group of 28 states.  Therefore, we must work hard and effectively to build up credibility in order to be listened to as an informed, reliable and effective member state of the EU whose policies and actions will advance not only our interests but can be seen to promote the interests of the EU as a whole.  <\/p><p>  It is a reality that large member states will always be listened to but smaller ones must establish their effectiveness.  Our policies must be strategically selected where we have a national interest, where we can be seen to contribute and where we have knowledge.  We can also, and often do, act in the role of facilitator or broker of compromises where no direct national interest is involved.  This also raises our profile as a country.  <\/p><p>  A considerable amount of background work is necessary to promote our interests in the EU.  It is a resource demanding activity, both in terms of numbers and capabilities, as can be deduced from the numbers and capacity devoted to this area by all of the other 27 member states.  The permanent representative in Brussels is at the forefront of dealing with the EU but a very close co-ordinated network operating between the Departments in Dublin and our embassies and missions abroad is vital.<\/p><p>  The officials of the Irish permanent representation unit must work through the layers of the various committees with a view to preparing the issues for consideration and decision by Ministers.  By the time the proposals come before the Ministers they must be ready for final decision.  For example, if foreign Ministers face a lengthy agenda of between ten to 15 items in a period that spans from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. then only the most contentious issues can be debated at this stage.  The agenda items under discussion are crafted and shaped by discussion in committee that is directed along the way by policy guidance from headquarters.  Therefore, the work of the people who work at the permanent mission is to seek out and provide as much information as possible on the issues coming on the agenda, filling in the position of other member states and advising headquarters in Dublin.  The policies are formed in capitals on the basis of information provided by the permanent representative and by the bilateral and other missions.  Officers at meetings in Brussels, however, must be able to react to the ebb and flow of a discussion in the committee, to judge and, if necessary, to influence the direction of the discussion.  <\/p><p>  In the external relations foreign policy area - where issues are considered - there are a number of committees.  I use it as an example because it is an area that I know well.  In the external relations area the main committees are the geographical regional committees.  For example, there is a Balkans committee, Africa committee, Asia committee and committees on Latin America, disarmament, human rights, civilian crisis, military, etc.<\/p><p>  The work of such a plethora of committees feeds into the political and security committee which meets for two full days a week and more when they are preparing the agenda for foreign Ministers.  The political and security committee discusses issues relating to conflicts, hears from EU special representatives - mainly for conflict areas, heads of military and civilian missions which are directed by the political and security committee and proposes actions for consideration, such as the imposition of sanctions, sending an EU force which is military or civilian, granting financial assistance, withdrawing financial assistance, etc.<\/p><p>  In order to keep track of all of these areas of business and to adequately service the country's interests, the officers in the permanent representation unit must constantly keep up to date by informing themselves on the background to the issues.  They do so by meeting relevant officials in the external action service and the desk officers which is where the proposals on the agenda often originate.  They also meet representatives from other interested member states in order to get their views on issues.  It is a constant mining of information.  They have to maintain close dialogue with headquarters in Dublin which also engages with the bilateral missions.  <\/p><p>  Foreign staff in bilateral missions also build up information through contacts, constant meetings and a constant feed of reports to HQ from the bilateral missions passed through.  That contributes significantly to the information gained and provides a background to the discussion that takes place in Brussels by shedding light on the positions of other countries on issues of importance to us.  Let me give an example.  If we want to bring an issue to the table we raise it within the external action service with the Presidency and we lobby in capitals.  In doing so, if we want to bring an issue forward we need firstly to strategically assess the international context, the possible like-minded support from fellow member states and plan a campaign for discussion through committees with, if necessary, parallel lobbying by bilateral missions and at political level, if necessary up to the foreign Minister and the Taoiseach.  It is also necessary, for the people in the permanent representation unit, to maintain close contact with MEPs who debate these issues, not just the Irish MEPs, but also chairs of committees and committee members.  That is the generality.<\/p><p>  I shall conclude by making some general points.  It would be extremely useful to develop a public diplomacy strategy.  We have a public diplomacy strategy - or the Department of Foreign Affairs does - which is focused on promoting the country abroad.  I have felt for quite some time that it would be very useful to have one in order to inform people in Ireland of the work carried out on their behalf and in their interest.  Social media could be used as a tool whereby the actions of people working in missions abroad could be detailed and would give an idea of what the work entails.  There is a great fog and mystery about what people in the Department do on a day to day basis.  Such a measure would open up and take the lid off some of that uncertainty.  Schools and school programmes, group programmes, etc. could also be used.  There is scope for such measures. <\/p><p>  It is very important and would provide invaluable to get our people into the external action service and other Commission and Council organisations.  They are international civil servants but it is extremely important to have our people in the organisations.  We also need to have the capacity to accept invitations to second officials to other foreign Ministries. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000003#B00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392905400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members for the invitation to address the committee and to exchange views on Ireland's engagement with the European Union in the context of the review of foreign policy and external relations currently being undertaken.<\/p><p>  IBEC and our numerous sector associations are keen to support this review.  We are committed to working closely with Government and policy makers at national, European and international level, to shape conditions to drive business and economic growth.  IBEC recognises the significant role the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish ambassadors and their embassy staff play in representing Ireland across the world.  Taking responsibility for the task of representing Irish interests on a complex range of diplomatic and other issues contributes to a positive view of Ireland.  This has been an important factor in restoring Ireland's reputation abroad and supporting economic recovery.  <\/p><p>  Ireland is a committed member of the European Union and IBEC is particularly conscious of the important role of the Irish permanent representation to the European Union.  We meet regularly with Ambassador Declan Kelleher and Ambassador Tom Hanney and their staff to advance important issues of interest to Ireland at institutional level in Brussels.<\/p><p>  During 2013, IBEC worked closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on delivering a successful Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union for Irish business and Ireland as a nation.  The six-month Presidency was marked by an impressive array of activities, seeking to make progress across a broad range of EU policy issues.  This was the seventh time Ireland held the Presidency since our accession to the EEC in 1973.  It was not just about Ireland having to manage the affairs of the European Union, but an opportunity to advance a positive, forward looking agenda in Europe and prove that our returning confidence as a nation was justified.  While the true legacy of this Presidency will emerge over years, an initial assessment from a national EU and business perspective must be positive.<\/p><p>  Ireland's Presidency programme sought to promote economic stability, jobs and growth.  This programme has great synergy with the business community's message which was formulated by IBEC in its document, Driving Economic Recovery.  In promoting economic stability in the European Union, the Presidency made progress in areas such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the capital requirements directive, rules for banking recovery and resolution and the European semester process.  <\/p><p>  The promotion of jobs and growth is an issue that is of crucial importance to Ireland and the Presidency prioritised negotiations for a political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission on the multilateral financial framework which secured a &euro;960 billion EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020.  It also secured provisional agreement on a new &euro;77 billion research and investment programme for the European Union under Horizon 2020.  In conjunction with the Presidency, our work also placed emphasis on advancing a number of outstanding Single Market issues, along with tackling youth unemployment.  <\/p><p>  An EU negotiating mandate for the transatlantic trade and investment partnership was also secured during the Irish Presidency.  We particularly appreciated the support of Ambassador Michael Collins during his time in Washington and we are committed to working closely with Ambassador Anne Anderson in the months ahead on advancing this important initiative.  These EU-US negotiations not only have the potential to deliver from an economic perspective, but are also extremely important from a global strategic perspective.  They should deliver higher GDP growth, create job opportunities and help restore the European Union's position globally.  IBEC continues to work with strategic business partners in both Europe and the USA to advance these negotiations.  We meet regularly with key EU trade negotiators to advance business interests in areas such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices, food and drink, the digital economy and internationally traded services.  It is important to achieve the correct balance through this agreement in reducing tariffs, improving co-operation on regulation, opening public procurement markets and ensuring that data is able to flow across borders to support and maximise the potential of innovation for both manufacturing and services here in Ireland and in Europe.<\/p><p>  During 2013, IBEC also organised several events promoting business priorities.  These included an address by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, to business leaders.  The IBEC CEO conference focused on the strength of the Irish and European business model.  Our CEO conference, held in the past few weeks, was also addressed by Lord Livingston, the Minister of State for Trade and Investment in the United Kingdom.  A St. Patrick's Day event in the European Parliament, hosted with Irish MEPs, showcased Irish food and drink.  The EU-US Business Round Table in Dublin Castle in April facilitated an important exchange of views with Karel De Gucht, the European Commissioner for Trade, and Michael Froman, who was then a White House economic adviser and is now the United States trade representative.  The BusinessEurope Council of Presidents brought business leaders from across Europe to Dublin to agree priorities for the year ahead.  We welcomed the support of the Government in the delivery of all of these events and initiatives.<\/p><p>  IBEC also supports the work of the Export Trade Council and its role in driving effective implementation of the Government's trade, tourism and investment strategy, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy.  We welcome the inclusion of private sector members on this council, which includes four Cabinet members and the heads of State agencies relevant in the trade and tourism arena.<\/p><p>  IBEC appreciates the work of ambassadors and their teams in a range of important global markets that helps to open doors for Irish business.  A key element of the Government's strategy relates to the 27 priority markets that were identified and in which local market teams have been established, headed by ambassadors and comprising representatives of embassies and relevant State agencies.  This team Ireland approach has facilitated the drawing up of focused local market plans and greater co-ordination among State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  This development should help to support the important contribution made by Irish companies trading and investing abroad.<\/p><p>  At recent meetings of the Export Trade Council, IBEC has presented an overview of the trade agreements currently being negotiated by the European Union.  These agreements should open up markets and provide opportunities for Irish business.  Their impact should be considered in the current review of priority markets for Irish trade promotion and export agency support.  The IBEC paper recommends a focused strategy that includes support for established markets, such as Canada, the USA and Japan, as well as support for emerging markets, both large, the BRIC countries, and smaller countries, like Korea, Singapore and Vietnam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392906000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ivory for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000005#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1392906000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I thank the groups for their presentations.

A number of the bigger countries, in particular the United States, appoint almost all their senior representatives abroad on a political basis.  Big member states in the EU, including the British and the French, do not do that.  Some countries appoint people who are skilled in trade.  We have never had a tradition of that.  Our Civil Service is strictly a civil service.  I should not say never because in the early years of the State we did have political appointments but in recent decades there have not been political appointments.  In looking at the arguments, part of the reason for it is practical.  Most of our missions are composed of one or two people.  Up to 50% of the Irish embassies abroad have two people or only one person and a larger proportion now have one person.  One must take account of the practical aspects of running an office.  Everyone has to work to the pin of their collar, in particular doing a whole range of things such as consular work, administration, political work and economic work.  The bigger countries could afford to have a figurehead who is politically well connected but other staff are required to do the work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1392906600,"counter":733,"content":"<p>I accept Ms Cross&rsquo;s point, but it worked well from a European perspective when John Bruton was appointed to act as a figurehead in the United States.

I feel there is a lot to be said for a Civil Service involvement being maintained because we work under the rules of the Civil Service but I agree it is an issue.<\/p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked how we balance the opening of missions.  It is a difficult issue because the resources, in line with the country&rsquo;s economic situation, have been cut in recent years and choices have to be made.  We now have a very lean foreign service.  As I mentioned to Deputy Dooley, what has been cut back significantly is the number of people in the missions abroad.  We have quite a number of missions now that have one person from Ireland.<\/p><p>  I feel one gets a very good return on having a person in the place, living and imbibing the culture.  The information they pass back is invaluable.  That is all the more so now, as Dr. Ivory has said, because we have such a heavy input.  A huge amount of the work of missions abroad is related to the promotion of the economic potential.  Having somebody in place who can work on the ground with the people who matter, find out what is happening, pass back information on contacts and work with the local business communities gives a great return for money.  We must be realistic.  A balance is required.  Politically, we would like to be in certain places.  Iran is a case in point.  However, we must make choices on where our interests lie at a particular time.  We are opening up a number of new missions and we expect that they will pay for themselves in the long run as we will get business promotion, better information on political interests and development return.  The missions we open will have to pay for themselves as that is how we balance the situation.  We have to make choices.<\/p><p>  I accept Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s point about languages.  It is one I meant to mention.  It is a big inhibiting factor for us that we do not have better skills in languages.  One can see it very clearly in meetings where officials can relate to each other because they speak the languages.  For example, in the whole political co-operation aspect of the EU there are two languages &ndash; French and English &ndash; and there is no interpretation in any of the committees.  All of our diplomats who service this plethora of committees have to be completely fluent in French.  It is sometimes a struggle because as a country I do not think we have accepted the value of languages, in particular in terms of the EU.  That is an area on which the Department needs to focus and is focusing on to a greater extent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000006#E01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392907200,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I am fascinated by Ms Cross&rsquo;s understanding that the new embassies, as proposed by the Department, will be self-funding.

It is a unique opportunity for a small economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s to have a showcase over a week.  It is very important to make the most of that for trade and investment.  It is important for missions organised around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to have a strong business element.  That is increasingly the case.  Senator Noone mentioned the USA.  This year, as he did last year, the Taoiseach will include in his programme an address to IBEC&rsquo;s key business partner in the USA, the US Chambers of Commerce in Washington.  He will speak about the value of, and advancing the partnership negotiations on, trade and investment.  That is particularly important.  There are also very good opportunities to bring business communities together during these visits.  For example, the State agencies, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and Bord Bia will organise a business lunch to coincide with St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events.  These are positive opportunities for us to showcase our ability to trade and invest abroad.  During the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities in Brussels we organised an event with our MEPs to showcase Irish food and drink.  We will do that again this year.  It is a good and valuable opportunity to show other nations what we have to offer.<\/p><p>  The Senator also asked about the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, issue.  That is extremely important, not only for Ireland but for our European partners and members of the OECD.  We are closely following the OECD G20 project on BEPS and this year the work being done on it in Paris will reach important milestones.  We meet regularly with the Revenue Commissioners and do joint work with our members and the Institute of Taxation to understand the progress of this project and its likely outcomes.  It is most important that clear and defined rules come out of it.  We have always taken what I think is the correct position, to make sure people comply, the most we can ask for is clearly defined international taxation rules and that companies follow those.  That will have implications.  We have many double taxation agreements, which will have to be considered.  Until we see the results of this project we do not know what its likely impact will be.  We are following it closely and will do so throughout this year when there are important deadlines.  We are engaging with the business advisory committee to the OECD.  IBEC has participated in some of its meetings in Paris on the international taxation issues and will continue to do so during the year.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked how a small country with limited resources makes a global impact.  A key part of that is building alliances.  We in the business community have prioritised our own building of alliances with business partners, within and outside Europe, for example, in the United States.  We must also recognise where we trade and invest, the European Union, the UK and the eurozone are very important trading partners and therefore it is important to maintain and work on our presence within the Union.  We have limited resources and need to develop business elsewhere.  We would welcome a review of where embassies are based, for example, a new embassy will open in Kenya.  Africa offers opportunities not only for Ireland to assist development through Irish Aid, but increasingly African countries seek trading partners.  Having worked with the group of African ambassadors here I know they are very keen that we develop trade links with Africa.  The opening of the embassy in Kenya is very positive, in addition to our embassy in South Africa.<\/p><p>  Members mentioned the work of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Donohoe, in representing Ireland.  We were very happy to welcome him to the most recent meeting of our EU and international trade committee, last week.  We had a very good exchange of views with him on advancing business priorities in this important year of change within the Union, with elections of MEPs, a new Commission being appointed, a new Commission President and a new Council President.<\/p><p>  Deputy Byrne also asked whether students are coming to Ireland or going to Asia, specifically Korea.  The number of students coming into Ireland has been increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000007#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392907800,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ivory.  I wish to return to Deputy Byrne's core point.  Our limited resources in the permanent representation to the European Union were mentioned, but they are not that limited as a significant number of people work there.  I would like to hear more about the relationship between how much energy goes into developing markets for Irish business, in other words the trade element, and how much energy goes on duplicating work done by the other 27 members of the European Union in sifting through data and information.  I would also like the concept of democratic legitimacy, which is the big buzzword in Europe, to be teased out.  How many decisions are made in buildings such as the offices of the permanent representation in Brussels, where subjective calls are made which are removed from the political process and do not find their way to committees such as this?  Is there sufficient public scrutiny of decisions made on Ireland's behalf in Brussels in the offices of the permanent representation?  We met both ambassadors recently and they are doing an excellent job.  I wonder how it might be improved.<\/p><p>  In this day and age do we really need an embassy in every EU capital?  We certainly need a trade presence, but do we need an embassy given that we have EU passports?  To develop this point, in the current economic climate would we be far better off having a presence in many joint European Union embassies throughout the world rather than picking and choosing those we perceive to be most important for a full Irish Embassy or consulate presence with nothing in other areas?  The Lisbon treaty significantly allows for this.<\/p><p>  The United Kingdom seems to be backing away.  At the beginning of the week we attended an interparliamentary conference in Brussels at which there was no UK presence.  Should we examine other bilateral arrangements?  Obviously there is the euro.  There are also north-south bilaterals, and Benelux was mentioned as were the Nordic countries.  Which bilaterals should we focus on improving as well as those at which we are already quite good?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000008#G00200","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1392907800,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and compliment them on their efforts in Ireland's participation in international trade and diplomacy.  I compliment the diplomatic corps and the business sector on their engagement on, involvement in and support of the statutory services during our Presidency, with particular reference to the ongoing need and the role they have played.  Congratulations should also be extended to the unions for the constructive role they have played in supporting the national cause, nationally and internationally.  It has not been an easy thing to do in the type of climate in which we have been living and we should recognise it officially.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about the point made by the Vice Chairman about reducing our diplomatic influence in EU member states because we are reducing our influence in the European Parliament numerically.  The statisticians will state numerically we retain the same strength we had before and that we have a greater influence than some of our bigger neighbours in terms of exact proportionality, but democracy is not about proportionality and never was.  One could reduce the membership of all member states by 20, in which case a number of member states would have no representation and one could still state theoretically the rest of the EU is proportionally represented.  I do not accept this.  There is a need to recognise now that we have not reached a juncture whereby each member state in the European Union recognises it is partly responsible for the EU itself.  There is a tendency in this country, and I have spoken about it many times before as have other people, to refer to &quot;our Commissioner&quot;.  It should not be &quot;our Commissioner&quot;.  It should be the EU Commissioner for whatever responsibility that person has.  The Commissioner appointed in Germany, France or the UK should be equally responsible for the portfolio to the Irish people and the Irish nation.  The thinking must change fairly substantially before we can move forward to the extent we think as a union.  We do not do so yet.  When we do get to this point then we can think about the change in diplomatic representation, but I would be very concerned about doing so beforehand.<\/p><p>  We do not often flag the strides the Irish economy has made since joining the European Union.  For example, 20 years ago our GDP <i>per capita<\/i> was approximately one third of the average in the EFTA countries.  This has all changed.  Even in the difficult circumstances in which we have found ourselves we are at least on par with, or ahead of, most of our European colleagues.  This again is largely due to the efforts of the business and diplomatic sectors and the policy being pursued at present.  It is hugely important we recognise this.<\/p><p>  I wish to briefly refer to the influence of Ireland within the European Union.  With the US worldwide withdrawal from policing, as it used to be called, having regard to unfortunate experiences in recent times, there is quite strong evidence a vacuum is developing.  I do not believe there is the same respect for the European Union by some of our neighbours as existed a few years ago.  I draw a parallel with the war in Bosnia, where it was quite clear to a perpetrator nobody would or could interfere for historical reasons and did not interfere very long time.  Eventually there was interference in the form of US intervention.  This brought about a complete change in the pattern in the area.  There were sudden recognition this cannot go on forever, and it did not go on forever.  We remember all of the calls for intervention from the EU but it did not intervene.  If the Ukraine were a member of NATO right now I wonder whether the same things as are happening there would have happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000008#G00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392908400,"counter":748,"content":"<p>Just to clarify, I asked a question about the EU embassies and did not express an opinion on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000009#H00200","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1392908400,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I was afraid the conversation might develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014022000009#H00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1392908400,"counter":750,"content":"<p>Let it develop.

It is good to have their input and the opportunity to talk to them.  It is right that we embark on a review of our foreign affairs arrangements, our diplomacy, the aims of our foreign policy and where we deploy resources.  Such a review is welcome and necessary.  Circumstances have changed as a consequence of the extraordinarily deep recession, movement in Northern Ireland and changes within the European Union.  This context informs why we would want to review policy.  It is a worthy review and exercise.<\/p><p>  Before we talk about the review, it is no harm to applaud ourselves on our outstanding EU Presidency.  It was a great credit to us and we did well.  Our chairmanship of the OSCE and our election to the UN Commission on Human Rights must be borne in mind.  We have had three enormous successes.  I had the privilege of leading the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe.  Senator Terry Leyden, a member of the committee, is the vice chairman of that delegation.  We are having a significant input, keeping Ireland at the forefront of the human rights agenda and concern for the rule of law and democracy.  These are core values in this country.  While they are important in themselves, they are also important to the Irish brand and the way Ireland is perceived, which have implications for trade and commerce.<\/p><p>  With regard to promoting business, from my limited experience and intuition, more than anything else, I believe Ms Cross&rsquo;s final remark was very important.  She was correct in saying there is no substitute for personal intervention and the personal touch.  No submission of documents and no use of IT or social media could substitute for interpersonal contact by people on the ground and the development and sustaining of relationships.  We need to bear that in mind in any analysis or deployment of resources.<br \/><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font> When the Minister set out the terms of reference of the review, he said we would review the contribution of foreign policy to the economic development of the country.  I ask the panel to comment on this, particularly Dr. Ivory as the matter is relevant to his work.  It is relevant to all the delegates.  I would like to see a mission statement stipulating the job of our foreign or diplomatic policy is to maximise business and trade and the number of jobs.  However, this should be achieved in a regionally fair fashion.  Thankfully, we have had great success in recent years in attracting inward investment.  There has been tremendous internal job creation by the private sector, which I welcome very much.  However, as a representative of the regions it would be remiss of me not to point out that constituencies such as mine, Cavan-Monaghan, are not sharing in this.

I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to share the main findings of the report.  I will outline the rationale behind our work and what we hope to achieve.  Following this, Mr. Alan Gray, from Indecon International Economic Consultancy Group, will take members through a summary of the economic analysis and key proposals.<\/p><p>  Early last year, we set about commissioning this research as an independent examination of whether the cost of child care represents a barrier to families with young children to take up, or to remain in, employment.  A noteworthy feature of current child care funding policy is the absence of any child care support for low-income working families who do not avail of the community child care subvention scheme.  As part of our work in Donegal County Childcare Committee, we frequently speak to parents who, on having their second child, are forced to leave work if their income is marginally above the band for the family income supplement.  As demonstrated in the report, an annual cost of full-time child care for two children of &euro;16,500 is simply inaccessible for a high percentage of working families.<\/p><p>  The consequence is that mothers, and it usually is mothers, then join the statistics of the unemployed with child dependents mentioned in the report.  It has been shown that these people will be more likely to remain unemployed and will have a lower probability of exiting the live register.  In this sense, the cost of child care reinforces Ireland&rsquo;s especially poor record of consistent long-term unemployment.  Child care in Ireland is the second most expensive in OECD countries but we have known this for quite some time.  This was the key driver of undertaking this work.  Despite almost universal agreement on the issue and many reports on what quality child care should look like, until now, a formal analysis or support proposal on the affordability of child care has not been forthcoming.<\/p><p>  In developing the research proposal for this work early last year, we did not want to set this only in the context of the cost of child care.   We are aware that child care is a labour intensive service because of adult-child ratios.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Avril McMonagle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392888900,"counter":775,"content":"<p>As an independent economist I am very happy to go through the evidence in our study.  The study focuses on whether child care represents a barrier to employment.  The levels of unemployment in Ireland represent a horrific burden on those who are involuntarily unemployed.  A particular concern is the high level of long-term unemployment.  Any measures which address long-term unemployment, or barriers to taking up employment, will benefit individual families and children and reduce the key underlying cause of poverty in Ireland.  In that context an issue is whether child care costs are an inhibiting factor in addressing unemployment.<\/p><p>  I would like the committee to consider the danger of policies being considered in a piecemeal way, for example, employment policies that do not consider the impact on children or poverty, or child care policy that does not consider the impact on employment.  A linked, integrated policy assessment is needed.  Sometimes people consider measures to overcome the child care barriers to employment as existing only in the child care development space.  The Government is spending &euro;1.5 billion per annum on active labour market policies so there are significant funds potentially available but very few going into measures to assist families with child care costs where they are a barrier to employment.  There are over 400,000 households with children under 10 years of age and over 260,000 with children under five.<\/p><p>  Until now there was a strong focus on the average weekly spend on paid preschool child care, which is approximately &euro;133 a week.  That is influenced by the fact that many families pay for only very few hours and does not represent the costs faced by families trying to look after children if they wish to obtain full-time employment.  More relevant are the new costs that the Indecon analysis identified, the cost of full-time paid child care.  The average annual cost for two children in full-time paid child care in Ireland is over &euro;16,000.  That is not surprising given the nature of the service provided but if one compares that to the average industrial wage, unless there is State investment to help low income families, they will not be able to take up jobs.  As an economist I believe one of the key issues is whether child care costs are an inhibitor to employment in households with the greatest need, with a long cycle of unemployment and economic and social deprivation.  The evidence confirms that child care costs represent a barrier to unemployment.  A total of 21% of families indicated the cost restricted the hours they worked and 26% indicated it prevented them looking for a job or made them turn down a job. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Grey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392889500,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McMonagle and Mr. Gray.

Most members are families with Start Strong, but for those who are not, it is a coalition of organisations, with approximately 50 in the group, seeking to advance children&rsquo;s early care and education.  We work from a children&rsquo;s rights perspective.<\/p><p>  Young children are the politicians, farmers, teachers, carers, doctors, builders, artists, economists, nurses and entrepreneurs of the future.  They are our most precious natural resource and their future rests with us.  We owe it to them to give them the very best possible start in life, which is why we need to look at the issue through the lens of children's education and what will provide the best outcomes for children.  Children&rsquo;s early years are a crucial time and it is that early educational experience that has most impact on their learning throughout their lives.  Quality early care and education give children the learning experience they will carry through their lives, laying the foundations for lifelong learning.  It is much more than glorified babysitting or minding children, as it is part of the start of education.<\/p><p>  There is a strong economic argument for public expenditure in early childhood that rests on its benefits for children.  Longitudinal studies have shown that high quality services for young children can bring significant benefits for children's welfare, development, educational attainment and a range of long-term outcomes.  It is an investment that makes sense; in addition to it being the right thing to do, it is an economically sound investment with strong returns.  Despite the importance of early education and strong returns on such an economic investment, Ireland does not have a history of investing a major amount of public money in it.  The cost of early education has been correctly highlighted by the Donegal committee and it is largely met by parents.  Often the costs are unattainable and like a second mortgage or even in excess of a mortgage.  They can be unaffordable and often lead to parents having to make a Hobson&rsquo;s choice not to work because they cannot afford to do so.  According to the OECD, Ireland invests only 0.4% of GDP annually in child care and early education services compared with an OECD average of 0.7%.  To just reach average OECD expenditure, the Government would need to invest an additional &euro;450 million a year in children&rsquo;s early care and education.  We would have to invest the same amount again to reach the 1% of GDP benchmark recognised as the level of annual investment required to achieve high quality early education.<\/p><p>  I have mentioned that research has demonstrated the significant impact of early learning and its effect on a child&rsquo;s life.  There have been two significant findings of this research.  The first relates to the long-term impact and how early education affects how we, in turn, do in school, whether we go to third level and, ultimately, our work life and the types of career we have.  A second key finding is that early education only has this impact when it is of high quality.  Poor quality care means that not only do children not benefit but that they can also be harmed by these experiences.  The most effective way to ensure services are of good quality is for the Government to invest money directly into services rather than channelling it through tax breaks.  Greater direct investment in services would ensure there would be control of quality, equitable access, training and the co-ordination of services.  Where there is \"demand-side\" funding such as tax-free allowances, in the likes of the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, they are judged to have lower quality services, as can be seen in the UNICEF league table.  Ironically, the services tend to be less affordable for parents, as indicated by the OECD in its examination of child care and early education costs.<\/p><p>  We have a huge challenge ahead of us if we are to provide high quality early care and education services which are accessible to and affordable for everybody.  The free preschool year is great and has significantly improved access, with 94% in the age cohort accessing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciair&iacute;n de Buis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392890100,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their informative and enlightening presentations.

I will be as brief as possible but, to be fair, this is an opportunity for the committee to ask questions and to make valuable use of the experts who are with us this morning to discuss an important issue that faces so many families around the country.  I compliment the Donegal County Childcare Committee on the work it has done in producing the report which helps feed into this important debate.  No one in this room is not supportive of high-quality early childhood care and education.  We are all united in that regard.  We will talk about the RTE \"Prime Time\" programme later.  Early childhood care and education is a fundamental component of our education system.  High-quality child care and education should not be incompatible with affordability.  Parents must be able to make the choice based on what they feel is best for their children and circumstances rather than on affordability.  We should support people who want a family and a career.  We should recognise that in some cases parents want to stay at home with their children.  Affordability and quality are not incompatible.<\/p><p>  Ms de Buis highlighted quality in particular.  If she were designing a scheme, what mechanisms would she build in to ensure a high-quality service?  We all support the concept of free early childhood care and education for everyone.  That would be utopia.  As an Opposition party it would be easy for us to call on the Government to do that, but we must be realistic about the country's financial constraints.  With that in mind, we must consider a targeted approach.  Mr. Gray and Ms McMonagle could confirm whether that is the rationale behind their position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000006#E00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392890700,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I want to apologise on behalf of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who cannot attend today.  I welcome the members of the Donegal County Childcare Committee and commend them on commissioning this report, which is a valuable contribution to our deliberations.  I also welcome the members of Start Strong who are here.  We are very impressed by the work of both groups.<\/p><p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in approach to the child care issue would be more similar to that of Start Strong in that we favour a universal approach.  Support for the first year is sacrosanct and should be maintained.  We would also prefer the second year to be universal, but we are mindful that there are budget constraints.  Therefore, as it is unlikely we will have universal care for the second year, we see merit in a targeted approach for deprived communities and families.  <\/p><p>  I have a number of comments or questions on the presentations made today.  The Donegal County Childcare Committee members stated that a noteworthy feature of current child care funding policy is the absence of any child care support for low-income working families who do not avail of the community child care subvention scheme.  Why do they not avail of it?  The cost of child care in Ireland is the second most expensive of the OECD countries.  Why is this the case and what is the solution?  Can the witnesses give us some examples of best practice in other countries?  The requirement that all child care service providers be tax compliant is primarily aimed at bringing non-regulated paid childminders into the regulatory system.  However, the majority of child care is provided by family members.  How do the witnesses see this area being regulated for the future?<\/p><p>  Start Strong delegates made the point that according to the OECD, Ireland invests only 0.4% of GDP annually in child care and early education services, compared to the OECD average of 0.7% of GDP.  Is this the major problem?  Internationally, 1% of GDP is the recognised benchmark for the level of annual investment required to achieve high quality early education.  If this was to happen here, how would it benefit children, child care providers or parents?  The free preschool year, with a 94% take-up, has significantly improved access, proving the fact that free child care works.  Therefore, should it not be expanded to a second year?<\/p><p>  We welcome the fact the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has announced there is to be a review of these two schemes.  On what should this review focus?  Despite the high cost of early care and education to parents here, the wages paid to those working in the sector are low.  Where does the money go and are huge profits being made?  Are child care profits not being reinvested in child care?  The Government could, and should, do more to lever quality improvements to the conditions attached to public funding.  Can we have some examples of how this could be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000007#F00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1392890700,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I extend a welcome to Donegal County Childcare Committee and Start Strong.  I wish to declare that I am chair of Early Childhood Ireland.  However, my role is a governance role and I do not get involved in the policy of the organisation.<\/p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to discuss child care and its provision.  Mr. Gray said earlier that one of the key questions to be asked is whether child care represents a barrier to employment.  Would we ever ask the question whether sending a child to primary school is a barrier to employment?  We would not ask that question.  Therefore, I was a bit hesitant about the report, because I wonder whether these issues would not be better discussed by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, because they are core issues.  I agree with Mr. Gray on the need for the restructuring of FIS and with the call for labour market activation measures.  <\/p><p>  I feel I have been on a journey on the issue of child care.  When I first got involved in children's rights, it was all about the status of the mother and whether she was working or not.  This determined whether children would be sent to child care.  The introduction of the free preschool year provided an impetus that allowed us to move the spotlight from the adult to the child and we all realised the importance and value of child care and the development of the child.  As a result, whether the mother is working or not is no longer the focus.  However, it is an important focus in the report in regard to labour market activation.  If we are looking at child care, however, we must focus on the child.<\/p><p>  Issues have been raised in regard to affordability, accessibility and quality and how we get them all to fit together.  We must ask serious questions about our investment in child care.  As I asked already, would we ever ask whether primary school was a barrier to employment?  Ms McMonagle spoke very well on this issue on Newstalk this morning and the debate was very interesting, but when I hear the discussion focus on costs, parents and taxation, the child appears to be forgotten.  I recognise the work of Donegal County Childcare Committee is outstanding, but I am a little hesitant to support the report here, because I feel it might be better suited to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  <\/p><p>  What was the impetus for the report?  Was it initiated because parents were not able to access child care places and is it to do with demand and supply?  What were the terms of reference of the report?  Mr. Gray said he went into the report without knowing what it was going to produce.  However, a report normally has a starting point and I am interested in knowing what that was.<\/p><p>  The committee here has also had representations from professionals in the sector in regard to salary levels.

The report commissioned by Donegal County Childcare  Committee mentioned Letterkenny and families not being able to access subsidised places because the subsidy only goes to community based child care centres.  Is one of the recommendations therefore that we should roll out those incentives to child minders?  Start Strong has been quite strong on the issue of registration, but currently registration is voluntary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000007#F00400","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392891300,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak here today.  I am very familiar with the work of the Donegal County Childcare Committee, as is my colleague, Deputy McConalogue.  We are very fortunate to have members on that committee of such professionalism and capacity to assist us with addressing child care issues as they arise in the county.  Regarding the report before us, I ask the witnesses to give us their perspective on the Scandinavian model of child care.  I have been told that the Scandinavian child care model is the gold-standard, as is the case with many areas of social policy.  Could we take that model and use it in Ireland or is it not as simple as that?<\/p><p>  The recommendations in the report are entirely sensible and logical.  Many years ago I worked with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, and we examined the issue of poverty traps.  The loss of a medical card and the cost of child care acted as barriers to people taking up employment.  It is clear to me that the solution to such issues is an NHS-type health system, where everyone has free medical care and a very affordable child care system, like the Scandinavian model.  If I were to wake up tomorrow morning to my dream Ireland, it would be something much closer to Scandinavia in terms of social policy.  I ask the witnesses to give us their thoughts in that regard.  I also thank the witnesses for coming here, particularly Ms Avril McMonagle and all of the team on the Donegal Country Childcare Committee, of whom we are all very proud.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000008#G00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1392891300,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak this morning.

I further welcome the representatives from Start Strong, who are exceptional advocates for early-years education.<\/p><p>  Quality is the number one issue, no matter what angle one is coming at early education from.  We must always try to improve the quality of the services that are being provided.  Early child care and education provision has mushroomed in the last ten years and is still finding its feet in many ways.  The introduction of the free pre-school year was the single most significant development in this area in recent times.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned the Scandinavian model of child care provision.  Access for all families, regardless of income, to child care is crucial and is what we should be working towards.  In the meantime, in the absence of a model which suits everyone, the issue of the affordability of child care for those who wish to enter or return to the workforce is the most pressing.  At the moment, many families do not have that choice, particularly those on lower incomes.  <\/p><p>  I ask Mr. Gray to expand on the overall cost of introducing the model he advocates.  How do the representatives of the Donegal County Childcare Committee and Start Strong see that model fitting in with the proposal to provide a second free pre-school year?

On childminding, one of the key recommendations from the report is to bring unregulated childminders into the regulated system.  As I pointed out earlier, that will enhance the quality of care in and of itself.  To use the example of Donegal, we have somewhere in the region of 300 unregulated childminders operating and only six are notified to the HSE or the Child and Family Agency, CFA, as it is now.  While it is true that the childminder sector exists, it is extremely under-utilised.  For over ten years, the Donegal County Childcare Committee had a childminders' advisory worker who worked with childminders to raise the standard of care they were providing and to bring them into the regulated system but that post has now been eradicated.  We have not had that post in Donegal for almost two years due to a reduction in funding.  As a result, our unregulated sector is actually getting bigger and we are not utilising it properly.  By contrast, in Northern Ireland in the late 1990s the situation was very similar to our current situation in that there was a huge, unregulated childminding sector.  The NI authorities introduced a voucher system or tax credits which solved the problem almost overnight.  Parents could not access a funding subvention for child care unless they used a registered childminder.  Childminding is an under-utilised area of child care and if childminders were regulated they would be inspected in the context of pre-school standards, subject to Garda vetting, required to undergo training and, most important, would be on the radar of local child care committees in terms of availing of supports and so forth.<\/p><p>  A second free preschool year would be extremely welcome.  While we know it will not solve the problem of full-time working parents being able to afford child care, it would make a significant contribution in that regard.  However, I would advise caution here.  We are working on the front line with child care providers every day and have a vast amount of knowledge in this area.  In that context and speaking particularly about Donegal, we would not have the capacity to facilitate a second free pre-school year at the moment.  In the absence of a capital investment programme to expand the infrastructure, we could see problems arising whereby the 0 to 2.5 or 0 to 3 age group are pushed out because the child care providers will follow the money, so to speak.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Avril McMonagle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392891900,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I thank members for the excellent range of questions that moved from philosophical areas to the general policy and to detail.<\/p><p>  Long-term involuntary unemployment in families has a significant impact on child development.  When it comes to quality of service, one wants the best one can get.  There is a growth in the economy with employment expanding but some families are being left behind.  Certain long-term unemployed groups will be left behind, unless we find a way to overcome the barriers to unemployment.  It is not the case of looking at two idealised models whereby one says here are exactly the same circumstances for families and which child care model do we want.  Families living in poverty have associated issues for parents such as a greater probability for depression and a poor sense of self-worth.  They want, however, to contribute, have a job and bring up their families.<\/p><p>  Unemployment and child care are not two separate areas.  There is a danger in our departmental process, research and even in Oireachtas committees that these are looked at in silos.  Why is it that so few children from long-term unemployed families enter university while large cohorts come from employed groups?  This is not simply due to the different types of child care provision they have.  A significant child care rights issue centres around children brought up in poverty whose parents have major concerns about their sense of self-worth.  It is also a key issue of employment.<\/p><p>  I advise governmental clients in 80 countries.

It is a very important topic and a priority for me as Minister to address the range of issues which the committee has been considering this morning.  Very soon after becoming Minister I stated that I wanted a focus on early years because it has been lacking in policy, funding and approach.  Child care is a critical issue because of its impact on the child and its potential, as has been well illustrated by the contributions of Start Strong and the Donegal County Childcare Committee.  Early intervention is good for a child's development.  It is extremely supportive for parents who are full-time at home and those combining work with family life.  It is also critical for the economy.  How we tackle this will be a cutting-edge issue for the Irish economy.  As the OECD stated, dealing with it properly would give us a competitive advantage.  The participation of women and men in the workforce is critical to attracting and keeping industry and creating jobs.  We must support parents working outside the home and those in the home who are perhaps involved in part-time work.  It is a huge issue for society and we must give it the type of attention we are giving it this morning.  It will be an ongoing issue.<\/p><p>  What both presentations have in common is a demand for more resources, which is the bottom-line issue.  All of the presentations call for more investment, and this is in the context of our borrowing &euro;8 billion per month at present and still meeting economic and financial challenges.  There is no question that as the economy improves we need to see more investment in child care.  It is a question of pace, scale, what is feasible at present and how we put in place the building blocks to ensure we can meet the challenges outlined.<\/p><p>  I thank Start Strong for its presentation on an approach to child care, which could be described as targeted universalism.  It is the right approach and the Right from the Start report I commissioned on early years from a group chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy very much highlighted that this type of approach has been good for children and provides the services we need.<\/p><p>  I also thank the Donegal County Childcare Committee for its initiative in this area and the recommendations it has made and costed.  It suggests an incremental approach to making child care more accessible and has put forward a way in which this might be done.  I was a member of the second commission on women and I remember recommending that we should have child care committees.  It is worth reflecting on the developments we have seen over the years with regard to child care committees throughout the country and the range of work they have done.  A total of &euro;11 million is given by the Department to child care organisations to support this work and &euro;9 million is given to child care committees to support the development of child care initiatives in their areas.  It is important to support those who provide services and analyse the gaps and opportunities.  Donegal receives &euro;363,000 from the Department to do the work we have spoken about this morning and support the providers in the area.  The child care committees provide an important support service throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Particularly in recent months, we have tried to ensure the child care committees work as a national body and bring together their range of experience into a national framework and dialogue on the needs of the sector.  In many ways the focus has been on the local area up to now, but we need to tap into the expertise of the child care committees and draw lessons from what they have to say.  The report by the Donegal child care committee is useful in this regard because it has taken its experience and is suggesting how we ought to move forward.  The different perspective it brings to the table provides food for thought.  Its report will form part of the review of the schemes we are conducting at present and will inform the thinking.<\/p><p>  I will give a broad overview of the approach to child care I am taking at present.  I am very conscious of the importance of child care in supporting parents engaged in employment, education and training.  This goes without saying.  Many parents entrust their children, as we have heard, to the care of relatives, friends or neighbours.  There has been a very concerted effort, including by the dedicated members of the child care committees, to get childminders to register, but it has been very unsuccessful.  It is not quite clear why, but very low numbers of childminders, despite targeted work by all of the child care committees, have registered.  Because of the informality of the childminding sector, initiatives to move it into a more formal regulated sector have not been successful.  Informal arrangements have persisted to quite a degree despite very focused work over the years.  Tax relief is available but this has not encouraged registration.  It is a feature of the past ten years which merits further discussion, given that many parents will make the decision to use childminders.<\/p><p>  Many other parents rely on early years services, 1,000 of which are community-based, while the remainder are commercially operated.  Subvention is provided through the child care employment and training support, CETS, and community child care subvention, CCS, programmes to low-income working families and those engaged in education, training and community employment.  It is also important to state that direct cash payments amount to &euro;2.2 billion.  These comprise child benefit and family income support, which is provided to 600,000 families, including 42,000 low-paid working families.  This helps families with general costs and some families use it to contribute towards the cost of child care.  It will never cover the full cost of child care for a family.  We have focused on direct cash payments in this country and I want to take up a point made on child care costs.  There is a perception that child care providers charge extraordinary amounts in comparison to other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000011#K00200","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392894000,"counter":805,"content":"<p>I will follow the point made by the Minister that the primary focus must be on the child.  That is true.  It is interesting to note what the economist, Mr. Gray, had to say.  Economists normally tend to dwell on facts, figures and statistics.  However, he has made the point that if we do not support the long-term unemployed in getting back into the workforce, children from such families tend not to develop in the same way as children from families who are working.  A strong point was made that in times of limited resources there was a need to target funding at those most in need.<\/p><p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this matter again.  As the Minister knows, my party raised it during Private Members' business in the D&aacute;il last week.  It is only right and proper that this debate is being held and broadened to ensure we tackle the issue, but we must do more than just debate it; we must bring forward workable solutions.  There is no point in just debating it and being a talking shop; we need to bring forward workable solutions.  <\/p><p>  I am somewhat disappointed to learn that the promised review of the two CET schemes has not commenced.  The Minister has stated in her document that it will commence.  It is important that it does and it should be a priority.  My understanding is that one of the schemes is closed to new entrants, if not both of them.  As currently operated - the Minister alluded to this fact - they are not nationwide and the opportunity to avail of them largely depends on where a child lives.  I do not think this is fair or appropriate.  <\/p><p>  The Minister and others, including the representatives of Start Strong and the Donegal County Childcare Committee, have spoken about childminders.  This morning members of the committee spoke about this issue, including the fact that childminders were unregulated.  The representative of the Donegal child care committee cited as one of the reasons there was a lack of registration the fact that the Minister's Department had abolished the post in county child care committees in the past two years.  Therefore, people do not consider they have a point of contact.  The vetting legislation that passed through the Oireachtas 12 or 18 months ago did not include a requirement for childminders to register.  My party tabled an amendment on the matter.  We also tabled an amendment to the new Child and Family Agency Bill, but, again, it was not accepted.  When will the new national standards be published?  What level of consultation has there been with practitioners?<\/p><p>  The Minister talked about schemes.  She said she had worked closely with the Department of Social Protection, but she made no mention of an after school scheme that had been announced in a previous budget that would target 5,000 children.  How many children will avail of this scheme and when will it be rolled out nationally?  I know that it is operated on a targeted basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000013#M00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1392894000,"counter":806,"content":"<p>Time, please, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000013#M00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392894000,"counter":807,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, but we only received the Minister's presentation before the meeting commenced.

I would have preferred to have received it last night in order that I could have read, it but I will read it again after I finish.<\/p><p>  Obviously, my party supports universal access to child care provision, but we also accept that the Minister must compete for funding for the Department's purse.  In the absence of the required funds, we must cut our cloth to measure.  If we had the funding sought, we would want to provide for a further year's entitlements, perhaps with a targeted approach in disadvantaged communities.  <\/p><p>  The report clearly states child care costs act as a barrier to employment.  Some 45% of the average industrial wage is spent on child care.  Many families do not earn the average industrial wage and low income families do not come anywhere near that income level.  It is important that a child has a quality child care experience, but it has been stated it costs a family over &euro;16,000 to have two children in child care.  Many families would not be able to afford that sum; therefore, low income families who want to work are forced to avail of poor quality and unregulated child care services.  It has also been stated many families rely on family and relatives to provide child care.<\/p><p>  On the suggestion that child care should be linked with entitlement to a medical card, I am not sure that would be a good idea.  Owing to all of the cutbacks, for many families supports are falling by the wayside.  This does not just apply to child care; it also applies to school transport and everything else linked with the medical card.  This issue needs to be looked at.<\/p><p>  I turn to the issue of tax reliefs.  While I agree that many families are not in the tax net, reliefs should be included to support universal access.

We all had time to read the other report from Donegal County Childcare Committee.  <\/p><p> I am old-fashioned about child care.  I believe the first few years of a child's life are very important, it is when the mother bonds with the child and learns to love and care in the family surroundings.

The question I am about to put may not be a relevant one for the Minister.

As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and as somebody who has worked, as have many members of the committee, for many years to develop a child care service that both presenters this morning would like to see, we are very familiar with the issues and many people around the table have done much work on these issues, including myself, over the years.  Clearly, there are new and ongoing challenges.  It is interesting that when there was a good deal of money around we chose to put it into direct cash payments which are important for families, but we did not make the kind of investment that other countries made in affordable accessible child care.  That is the focus of the discussion here.  How do we now play catch-up and how do we deal with this issue which is impacting on so many families?  It is not simply about talking about it, it is about taking action.<\/p><p>  The action I have taken is to have &euro;180 million in the preschool year last year, &euro;80 million on the targeted schemes and, &euro;4.5 million, for the first time ever, as a direct budget line to work on training and mentoring issues which the sector has identified as critical.  We are in the process of developing those training and mentoring schemes involving a huge amount of consultation with the sector.  For example, on the development of the mentoring scheme all of the child care committees from around the country have been represented at meetings and the voluntary sector has also come together to discuss what type of mentoring scheme it would like to see.  We will have 30 or 40 mentors in place in the next few months to begin to go into child care services and support them in terms of quality.  That is the method that works.  For the first time we have that money in a budget for mentoring and training.  During the Celtic tiger the issues of accessibility and affordability were not dealt with to the degree they needed to be dealt with.  That is the legacy that I and the Government have to deal with and on which we have to move forward.<\/p><p>  Some of the questions were about resources.  It is a resource question in terms of developing the schemes that are suitable and will reach the families we are discussing.  That is the reason the review is important.  It has started internally in the Department.  I want to examine how we can develop those schemes, whether they need to be integrated into one scheme which would deal with some of the issues raised members of the committee and the providers this morning, or developed in an incremental way.  I can come back to the committee at a later stage to discuss the review as it develops.  I am aware that people in the sector wish to contribute.  I do not want it to be a long review.  I want to get recommendations in fairly quickly.  I want to examine the schemes as they develop for the future in order that they can complement the development of the free preschool year and, hopefully, a second year although it would cost approximately &euro;180 million extra.  Everybody has agreed we should not move to a second year until we deal with the quality issues.  My focus this year is on those quality issues so that the sector is prepared and able to move towards a second year and the expansion we have been talking about.  There is a range of challenges from a resource point of view and from a quality qualifications point of view but we are responding to those as I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000014#N01500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392895200,"counter":825,"content":"<p>Is there buy-in within the establishment to change that given that we are all agreed that early years services represent the way to go?

We have a long way to go before there will be a shared understanding of that at societal level.  We have not had sufficient focus on early years.  While we say we are very child centred, and while the Government is trying to be child centred through the establishment of my Department and my work, as a society we focus quite a lot on primary school years and the years thereafter without focusing greatly on early years.  This committee and I are trying to change that by examining how services develop, highlighting the needs that exist and working to meet those needs.  There is no doubt that the focus has been more on the years from primary school onwards than on early years.  We need a dramatic change in order to realise the potential of early years and put the necessary services in place.  Many of those services will centre around parenting supports.  It is not simply about child care; it is also about our approach to maternity leave.  The early years strategy will examine this broad range of issues.  It includes, for example, the breast-feeding rate in Ireland, which is so low by comparison with those in other countries.  We have disturbing research showing that the breast-feeding rate of immigrant women in Ireland drops when they come here, presumably because of cultural attitudes.  All of these issues are about the early years.  We have a lot of work to do still to ensure greater appreciation at national level of the importance of early years, although every parent instinctively knows that.  In terms of the supports and development of the services, we are at an early enough stage.<\/p><p> I have addressed most of the issues.  My comment on the Department of Social Protection was simply to highlight that the change in terms of the double payments has affected those who are available to work in the sector, but the key and more important point concerns qualifications and training for everybody involved.

It is interesting that, during the period when there were people with particular responsibility for working with childminders, there were still only 1,200 childminders registered out of perhaps 30,000 or 40,000.  With regard to getting them to register and link in, there are other factors at play.  It is not simply a question of what is available at the local child care committee.  When there was a dedicated member of staff, there was still a very low number registering.  In Donegal, for example, six out of 300 childminders are registered.  The sector is so informal that it appears that trying to get childminders to link in with the local child care committee, do their work in a more formal way and avail of training supports presents a difficulty.  There is a childminders' organisation that my Department funds to quite a high degree.  There is more to this question than the approach that has been taken so far.  It deserves further study and understanding of what precisely is happening.<\/p><p>  We must consider the resources available for early years services.  There is much work to be done on early years services to which parents are entrusting their children.  Much work has not been done to date on training, qualifications and inspections.  We now need to focus on this work more and plan it.  Childminding in other countries has been brought into the net but it is often after some of this other work has been done.  This is an issue, of course.  I encourage every childminder to link in with child care committees and avail of the supports and services that exist.  A range of factors determines whether a childminder will do so, as we can see.  The arrangement did not work over the past ten years in terms of getting childminders to register and become involved in the formal network.  Many parents are of the view that determining who should mind their children, be it a neighbour or childminder, is a private decision and that this is how it should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000015#O00900","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392895800,"counter":834,"content":"<p>Is that scheme discontinued?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000016#P00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1392895800,"counter":835,"content":"<p>No, it is still in place.

A number of points that are relevant to this section of the committee's deliberations already have been made.  I refer in particular to the points on the early years and the neglect of this sector.  This may seem a strange comment to make given the obvious investment in child care facilities over the years.  Moreover, as I stated previously, there is annual expenditure of &euro;260 million in direct support to the sector.  In the past, however, the focus was very much on building up the bricks and mortar of the child care facilities.  While I have reopened the child care capital programme and have given almost &euro;8 million in 2012 and 2013, my focus, which is the necessary focus at present, is on supporting those who make up the staff of these facilities and improving quality standards.  One must understand how this has contributed to this discussion and to the challenges now being faced.  Reference already has been made to the pay levels, the status of early years staff and the challenges in that area.  I need not repeat them, as they were highlighted in the previous two discussions.  However, this is a sector with 5,000 services and more than 22,000 staff.  Change in such a large and previously under-supported sector will not happen overnight and it is important to understand that and to set ambitious but realistic objectives for that sector.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge, as have a number of members already, that the majority of services already operate to high standards.  However, parents and the sector must be assured that all services will be supported and regulated to ensure high standards across the board.  I am sure that most parents, when they enrol their child in a service, assume automatically that their expectations of standards and a high quality will be met.  Consequently, they are extremely shocked when they hear of or receive any evidence to the contrary.  This is the reason the \"Prime Time\" programme was so shocking for many parents.  I reiterate to parents that it is clear they should know what is going on in a centre, should have access to information and the inspection reports and certainly should ask questions.  However, the responsibility does not rest solely with parents but is also on the Government to ensure the sector is regulated.  I wish to make some points in this regard because, undoubtedly, there remain some pockets of poor practice.  Moreover, I have no doubt that some services, including community cr&egrave;ches, struggle to meet higher standards but there is no other choice.  Quality is a must for the sector.<\/p><p>  I now wish to focus on the actions taken and on which the Department has been working to drive the implementation of an early years child care quality agenda.  The Department has taken prompt action that will have a significant impact on the sector and in respect of the quality of care.  For example, the first measure taken was to organise, working with the Health Service Executive, HSE, at the time and Pobal, that inspection reports would be placed online and would be made publically available.  A huge amount of work was involved and I pay tribute to the small staff that worked on that, which has ensured that more than 2,600 reports are available online.  It has been a time-consuming activity for the inspectorate that has carried out this work but such transparency is of enormous value.  I should add that in addition to historic reports, more recent reports also are being published.<\/p><p>  As part of the arrangements for establishing the new Child and Family Agency, I had been working for some time with the children and family services of the HSE to standardise and improve the resources and work practices of the early years inspectorate.  For the first time, this service is now nationally managed and working to common standards, which is a huge improvement on the previous inconsistent and perhaps locally-managed arrangements.  Moreover, child care providers have commented to me on the improvements they already have seen in terms of a national approach.  A core problem for the service was that there were vacancies for inspectors in some parts of the country, leading to the extraordinary position, when one reflects on it, that in some areas there were no inspections.  Eight posts are currently being filled to address this problem and recruitment is well under way.  Once the recruitment process has been finalised, those eight people will be in position.  Moreover, a panel will be formed from which to draw further inspectors and the Government has allocated the funds for those posts.  As I have stated, an additional &euro;500,000 in funding has been allocated to assist the new Child and Family Agency to further strengthen the inspectorate.  This is the first basic requirement, which I believe now is being met.<\/p><p>  The second initiative was my prompt introduction of legislation, with the support of all Deputies, to amend Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991, which governs the regulation of early years services.  I took considerable legal advice on this issue to ascertain how far I could go in respect of the new legislative provisions brought in as part of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  That legislation passed through the Houses before Christmas and by bringing in this legislation, a new registration system for early years services was introduced.  In consequence, new services must now register before they can commence operation.  It is quite extraordinary that heretofore one was not obliged to register that one was setting up a child care facility.  Importantly, the legislative changes give inspectors new powers, which can be used before the stage of prosecution.  Yesterday, I met environmental health officers who told me how important this is.  While it had applied to other areas in which they carried out their work, it did not apply in respect of child care previously.  This means that a range of pre-prosecution actions has been introduced, which empowers them to a far greater extent than previously.  For example, they can impose improvement orders on a service, which, if not complied with, can result in de-registration of the service.

In response to Senator van Turnhout, I am the service director in the agency with responsibility for the reform programme of the agency and a number of specialist services, the early years inspection services being one of them, and related matters.<\/p><p>  In this opening statement I will cover three main areas, namely, reform, service activity, and transparency, accountability and quality assurance.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Fiona McDonnell and Mr. Mike Corcoran.  Ms McDonnell's role is national specialist for early years services, currently holding national responsibility for the inspection services.  Mr. Corcoran is the national manager for quality assurance.<\/p><p>  Early years inspection services are now part of the Child and Family Agency established on 1 January 2014, which comprises the former HSE Children and Family Services, the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board, and a number of other child-related services.  It represents the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in Ireland.  The agency has been established with a staff of 4,000 and an operational budget of &euro;609 million.<\/p><p>  With regard to reform, it is one of the key foci of the agency.  The significant legislative change in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 has a particular applicability to the early years inspection service.  Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991, which prescribes the powers of supervision and inspection of the early years services, has been amended.  The legislative change introduces a pre-approval registration model with the emphasis on quality assurance.  It comprehensively reforms the enforcement options available to the agency.  Under the new statute, existing notified providers are deemed to be registered with a requirement to reapply for registration within three years, and new services will be required to be registered before they can commence service provision.<\/p><p>  Inspections will be based on a newly developed set of national standards, which the Minister has confirmed will be implemented from May onwards.  These standards will focus on the experiences and outcomes for children attending the early years services.  They are intended to strengthen the management, governance and supervision of services.  They will provide a comprehensive framework for the regulation and quality assurance of all early years services.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the requirements of section 46 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, the agency has submitted a business plan to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which sets out a range of priorities to be addressed in 2014.  <\/p><p>  The focus in the early years inspection service will be on quality assurance, workforce development and outcomes for children.  The early years inspection service will operate on a national rather than a local or regional basis.  This is to ensure that resources are deployed to maximum effect and that a consistent service is provided.  A number of areas of action have been prioritised.  These are: strengthening the national early years inspection system; applying new protocols and standards to underpin regulatory compliance and enforcement; and introducing a registration system.  <\/p><p>  The new registration system, which replaces the previous system of notification, will be introduced in response to that amendment to Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000018#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry McKiernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392897300,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKiernan and call Deputy Troy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000019#S00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392897300,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Mr. McKiernan for their contributions.  It is very important that we have this meeting today.  We were all sick to the pit of our stomachs when more than six months ago, RTE exposed what was going on in certain pre-school and early childhood centres.  The Minister is right to make this a priority.  Nothing, including amendments to legislation, can be brought in fast enough because what we witnessed in that television programme was appalling.  I acknowledge the Minister is making strides to bring about reforms but there are some areas in which I worry about the speed of the reforms.<\/p><p>  The Minister said a core problem for the service was that there were vacancies for inspectors in some parts of the country.  Six months on, not all of those inspectors have been hired.  Last week during Private Members' business, the Minister confirmed that there were regions in the country which still did not have an inspector six months on.  I would not survive in my office for six months without a critical support staff member.  Why is it taking so long to hire these staff?  The length of time it is taking is unacceptable.  Why do we persist in hiring public health nurses for these roles despite the fact people across the board have called for experts in early childhood care to be hired?  The Minister is right that she got cross-party support for the amendment to the Child Care Act 1991 to bring in new tough sanctions, which are welcome.  <\/p><p>  I would like to focus on the quality of care and the regulations.  When will the regulations be published?  Will we put these new regulations on quality of care on a statutory basis?  Will we bring in robust legislation with a clear framework for quality of care so that we can give parents the reassurance they need in this regard?  <\/p><p>  The training fund is welcome.  I said before that this was too restrictive, as one of the issues exposed on the \"Prime Time\" programme was the inadequate support structures for management.  Management could not avail of this restricted fund.  Will the fund be available to services throughout the country?  I raised a concern about the manner in which the initial fund was distributed.  Will the &euro;1.5 million fund for this year be available to all service providers?  <\/p><p>  Last week on Question Time I raised with the Minister the bureaucratic nightmare of the vetting process where there is a need for double vetting for people attending a course and going on placements.  The Minister said she would have an urgent meeting with the Data Protection Commissioner.  Has that meeting taken place and if so, what was the outcome of that meeting?  Can the Minister give us an update on vetting times because that is very important?  <\/p><p>  I refer to unregulated childminders, an area I have highlighted on numerous occasions.  We are talking about paid non-relatives and not about a grandparent, an aunt or an uncle.  The Minister said she would welcome our views on parental choice.  Sometimes parents are left with no choice but to go down this route because it is the most affordable option.  If we are serious about a quality early childhood care, we cannot ignore this sector in which there are approximately 19,000 paid childminders looking after 50,000 children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000019#S00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392897900,"counter":853,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Mr. McKiernan for their presentations.  I also welcome the representatives of the Child and Family Agency for its first presentation to this committee.  From the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I noted that the transition has been successful.  I want to wish the agency's staff well in the job that has been entrusted to them.<\/p><p>  The documentary, A Breach of Trust, shocked the nation to the core.  It was a wake-up call for all of us and we knew that a number of actions had to be taken to ensure that nothing like this could ever happen again.  To prepare for today's meeting, I googled &quot;A Breach of Trust<i>&quot;  <\/i>last night and read all the headline comments.  I will touch on the actions that we were told needed to be taken.  The first recommendation was to have more robust inspections.  I am glad to see that the Minister has provided &euro;500,000 for this and that eight positions are ready to be filled.  When will we have enough inspectors?  Following the documentary some cr&egrave;ches sought inspections because they knew they would be put online and wanted to be categorised as good cr&egrave;ches.  However, they could not get such inspections and were told that some counties only had one inspector so it would not happen.<\/p><p>  The second point was that cr&egrave;che inspection reports should be put online and I know that that is in train.  I wonder, however, if all cr&egrave;ches have been inspected at this stage.  If not, how near are we to accomplishing that?<\/p><p>  When she introduced the legislation, which we all supported, the Minister covered the registration system which is welcome. <\/p><p>  The next item that arose was having better qualified staff, which has also been covered in the legislation.  In addition, the question arose about very low-paid workers and the lack of promotional opportunities, yet a lot of these cr&egrave;ches are very profitable.  I am not sure how we can address this matter.  As we can see, the Minister has done a lot of good work because many of these issues have been addressed.<\/p><p>  I welcome the introduction of a new national quality support service for early years' service that is coming in train.  The new regulations will be accompanied by national quality standards in the coming months, which is also welcome.<\/p><p>  There are huge problems concerning delays in Garda vetting so how can we overcome those delays?  The Minister has been doing a good job and she has come a long way in the six months since the launch of this child care initiative.  I wish her well with the rest of it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000020#T00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1392897900,"counter":854,"content":"<p>In preparation for today's meeting I re-watched \"A Breach of Trust\" to remind myself of its content.  The issues of training, management and culture were absolutely central to what we saw.  I welcome the training fund and the mentoring scheme the Minister is proposing.  It is really important to have consistency in that respect.  Deputy Catherine Byrne asked earlier about people who have been in services for a long time but have not availed of training.  If there is a genuine resistance to training, we may reach a critical point.  We are putting so much training on offer that the message must go out that we have an expectation that such people will be trained.  Ongoing training is required.  We have seen many people with 20 years service in child care who have not received training, but that would not be accepted in other professions.<\/p><p>  While it is positive to link inspections to registration, I am concerned about ensuring ongoing quality within a child care setting.  There are different angles on inspections about which I have concerns.  The first is consistency and that people should know what they are being inspected on, so that there is guidance for staff.  Anecdotally, I have heard different things from different staff.  An inspector may ask one question in one child care setting, but a different question in another setting.  Inspectors may also ask for things that are not within the remit of the inspections, but everybody wants to be fully compliant.  It is important to give staff guidance on what can be expected from an inspection so they can ensure that they reach those qualities.<\/p><p>  In addition, parents should know what they can interpret from the reports.  The delays in Garda vetting were raised but we know that some services will be rendered non-compliant for something like that which is totally outside their control.  Conflicting advice is being given to services, especially concerning how they should handle the confidentiality issue of students and Garda vetting.  We therefore need to give clear advice on that issue.<\/p><p>  There are also issues arising for different child care settings.  When we talk about child care costs everybody thinks it is a great money-making business but it is not, given some of the books l have seen on people's operations.  This is certainly the case for those operating the free preschool scheme where the ratios, space and contact hours are set.  They do not get paid for non-contact hours.  I have heard of inspectors arriving at the end of a child care day at 3.30 p.m. expecting to do their inspection.  The setting will therefore have to pay staff for those non-contact hours, even though parents are not paying for that.  There is no appreciation of the fact that this is happening.  <\/p><p>  In addition, capitation is being withdrawn for children who are not in attendance when it is outside the control of the setting.  They have provided staff to be there with the expectation that a child will turn up.  They cannot know in advance that the child will not turn up or will be brought away.  How can we deal with those issues when it is outside the control of the setting?  Obviously, there may be times when matters are within the control of the setting but otherwise there are issues, including the shortfall in payments.  <\/p><p>  People are becoming more professional through training at FETAC level 8 and higher capitation.  We want to develop a quality child care workforce but how much can settings afford to pay?  This links into our previous discussion about the County Donegal child care report, including how we are investing, who we are investing in, staffing, salary levels, career structure and development.<\/p><p>  I have raised the question of childminders several times in the Seanad, so I will not do so again now.  We need, however, to re-examine that matter on another day because it is a big issue.  I do not accept that we should not interfere in the matter.  The Minister referred to S&iacute;olta, the national quality framework for early childhood education, and Aistear, the early childhood curriculum framework, and said that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment or NCCA is examining them.  Can she give us a timeline for when the result of that examination can be expected?  It will be very much welcomed.<\/p><p>  To revert to an earlier point, who will be doing the inspections of child care settings?  For example, environmental health officers have a four-year degree qualification, so we also need to examine the quality of the inspections concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000020#T00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392898500,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I thank the Child and Family Agency and the Minister for the presentations.  I want to extend some of the points made.  When we look back on what was uncovered in the \"A Breach of Trust\" programme, my big question is how, even with the major changes that are welcome and not before time, a ramped up inspection regime can ensure it is not happening somewhere else.  It is a major concern.  We have vacant inspector posts and parts of the country are not being inspected.  Even if an inspector is regularly calling to monitor and audit, we saw that paperwork on lunches, tea and how many times nappies were changed was completed at 8.30 a.m.  The major question is about management.  The Minister has made money available in respect of FETAC in terms of upskilling for child care professionals.  What support or training has been offered to management?  There were breaches of management, with staff not being supported and procedures not being followed.  The only person who pays at the end of it is the child.  Children were appallingly treated in the settings revealed.<\/p><p>  A number of us have been contacted by the Association of Childhood Professionals.  What is the new qualification standard for staff?  There is still ambiguity.  The Minister referred to FETAC level 5 as the minimum required standard.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout also referred to non-contact hours or non-contact time.  There is political discussion about policy making and extending the free preschool year for another year.  If we got the money, we should have a well resourced one-year programme, where work is planned and reflected on by the workers to ensure a quality service.  As it stands, by only paying professionals for contact hours none of the planning can be done in an adequate way.  If we are to follow a curriculum such as HighScope, which involves engaging with children on their interests, reflect on it and change their surroundings on a daily or weekly basis to plan and implement the work, how can this happen if they are not being paid for non-contact hours?<\/p><p>  Aistear extends from preschool up to junior infants and senior infants.  It is a bridging programme and it is really good that there is continuity and consistency.  Who is inspecting after-school care services?  Children of four and five years of age in junior infants are availing of after-care services.  There is only a couple of weeks in the difference between preschool and after-school care and no one is regulating the sector.  I do not want to be here in six months time with another \"A Breach of Trust\" programme having examined after-school services.  The Aistear programme goes from the preschool to the primary school level but after-school care seems to be an afterthought.  I would like to know more about what we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000021#U00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1392898500,"counter":857,"content":"<p>A number of schemes have been highlighted by Deputies and the Senator.

Panels have been formed from which any new posts can be filled.  The new posts will be deployed to areas where they are most needed.  We are doing assessment of the overall capacity required.  Where there is a higher incidence of providers, there is a greater need for an enhanced inspection capacity in those locations.<\/p><p>  In terms of the number of inspections carried out in 2013, the figure is 2,432, representing 52% of all inspections of services carried out.  We received more than 300 complaints and eight prosecutions were instituted.  We are open for business in respect of complaints, referrals, or requests for advice and information because it is critical, even in the current circumstances, that parents, providers and staff can have confidence we will respond to issues referred to us and queries that need clarification.  A comprehensive information programme was devised comprehensive and rolled out by Fiona McDonnell to the providers.  They have been given a lot of information, advice and support and clarification on what is coming down the line in the legislative provisions.  Providers have been corresponded with alerting them to the new arrangements in 2014 as the legislation is enacted.  I emphasise that we are open and want to hear from parents and the public about any matters of concern.<\/p><p>  Where complaints are received, an immediate risk assessment is undertaken because complaints vary in scale of seriousness.  The most serious are prioritised for immediate investigation on whatever action may be required to follow.  When will we ever have an appropriate coverage in terms of inspection capacity?

The facility was asked to remove the carpet because it posed a risk as a result of dust and dirt, etc., despite the fact that it was clean.  This is a very obvious public health and environmental approach to a facility as opposed to considering a child's development and learning.  I am concerned about that sort of approach being taken.

Our core inspectors are assistant directors or public health nursing.  Our current inspector assistant directors took eight years to get to that level and in addition there is a requirement for five years' experience.  That means that 13 years is required of public health nurses before they can apply for inspection.  Public health nursing has a qualification in and a major understanding of child development.  It would very much look at the care, welfare and development of the child within services.  Regulation five specifically deals with it in considering supports for child development.  Sometimes there is a misunderstanding with regard to the quality frameworks and inspection services.  The threshold required for Aistear and S&iacute;olta is much higher than is currently required within the regulations and specifically regulation five.  We are very satisfied that we inspect in accordance with current regulations.<\/p><p>  With regard to the safety aspect of the question about the carpet, when we examine registration within the new regime and the move to standards-based inspections, it is important that we consider the premises, facilities, lighting, ventilation and similar issues at the beginning.  The core component of inspection will be examination of the care of children, their experience, available play, suitability of staff and so forth.  The big difficulty is the numerous regulations and requirements within the legislation.

How can we be sure what is going on in primary schools?  We can be sure because of a range of factors and it is obviously not just inspection that brings about quality in primary school.  There is a range of qualifications demanded of teachers and management, there are processes that are in place, and there is the relationship between parents and teachers and the involvement of a board of management.  It is the very same with preschool, and there should be a range of factors.  We are looking to ensure that each element is developed with the preschool and early years sector in mind.<\/p><p>  We could install video cameras and we could see how things progress but it would not necessarily be best for the child.  It is more about training, support and mentoring that staff get.  If staff misbehave with children on any video, elements such as recruitment, qualification, supervision and management come into play.  We must address those areas if we are to be sure about the quality of care that a child is getting.  The issue is multifaceted and not simply about inspection, so it would be wrong to think that dealing with the inspection area will resolve the kinds of issue portrayed on the \"Prime Time\" programme.  Although it will not do so, it is still a key factor.  A budget for recruitment of inspectors and development of that group is very important, and the process is under way.  There is also development in other areas.<\/p><p>  I will ask Ms McLoughlin to comment on a number of other themes regarding qualifications, training and mentoring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000022#V01000","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392899100,"counter":871,"content":"<p>It is not that S&iacute;olta and Aistear will go away, and they are very valid documents.

The issue raised by the Data Protection Commissioner is that for the purpose obtained the Garda vetting information should be destroyed within 12 months and that a note be put on file.  The Data Protection Commissioner says that the umbrella organisations for students and the colleges should not make the vet available to the student even if consent is given by the student.  The difficulty is that the provider has the responsibility to ensure that the Garda vetting is in place, not the colleges or the umbrella organisations.  That is the huge difficulty.<\/p><p>  Under the preschool regulations the colleges are not identified as the responsible person to make a determination of standards of vetting that have been applied to the student.  The responsibility lies with the provider.  What we require on inspection is that the Garda vetting of the applicant is available.  We look at the Garda vetting to examine if there are any gaps in the history of where the individual being vetted said they lived or were resident.  We have found gaps that are not in compliance with the Garda vetting.<\/p><p>  The original Garda vetting gives us comparisons in terms of the name and other details.  We have found a lot of information when we look for differences even with a verified copy from the colleges, which we then need to address.  At the end of the day the safety and protection of children is paramount.  Our meeting is next week and there is plenty of scope for finding a solution between us.  I hope we will have a solution in the very near future on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014022000023#W00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1392899700,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonnell.
