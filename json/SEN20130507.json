Every day that one comes into the Seanad there are calls for us to deal with the scrutiny of European legislation.  Today we have been asked to adopt, without debate, the EU scrutiny work programme 2013 of the Oireachtas joint committees' priorities.  I appeal to the Leader to reconsider his proposal and to arrange a debate.  For some considerable time Members on both sides have called for an opportunity to scrutinise EU legislation.  The least that we can do is to debate a motion and not just an item that is laid down in the Order Paper.  It seems completely illogical and somewhat farcical that we have calls every day to adopt issues yet a motion to adopt an EU scrutiny work programme is proposed to be adopted without debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700004#C00100","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1367933700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The motion is going through the D&aacute;il as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700004#C00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1367933700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>It seems that the Seanad seeks a role for itself but then votes measures down.

We can talk all we like about dealing with EU legislation, yet when a motion is tabled it is passed without debate.  That is not a good way for the Seanad to operate or deal with business.<\/p><p>The substantive issue that I want to raise relates to Priory Hall.  Before I am told to stop talking about a matter before the courts I shall state that I shall not comment on a court action.  This week Dublin City Council lodged a Supreme Court appeal against a High Court decision for it to provide temporary accommodation to Priory Hall residents.  The city council has now returned to the courts to deal with the matter.  The problem with the situation is that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan has sat on the sideline while the residents must go to court and fight their case while Dublin City Council, the housing authority for the area, drags people through the highest court in the land.  The families in the case are blameless, the city council is trying to remove itself from its role as housing authority and, unfortunately, the Government has sat on the sideline and not provided any answers to the people who have been left basically homeless.  The local authority did not do its job at the outset of the construction phase and the Government of the day had said that the matters are outside of its remit.<\/p><p>It is a matter for the Supreme Court to decide whenever it reaches its decision.  However, I call on the Minister to intervene in the situation but not in the court case.  I want him to give some practical help to the residents.  On that note, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that we call the Minister to the Seanad to explain his position regarding the Priory Hall residents and the Government's action in respect of them.  I also want him, more generally, to explain his position and the updated position on homes with pyrite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700004#C00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1367933700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty in asking the Minister to attend the House to discuss the Priory Hall situation.  It would be far more appropriate for him to do so after the Supreme Court rules on Friday and, therefore, I do not support the Senator's call.<\/p><p>I welcome the news today that 12 of the Pamela Scott stores have successfully exited examinership which has resulted in saving 137 jobs in the retail sector.  Key to the success has been the fact that negotiations with landlords have resulted in a 40% reduction in the company's overheads.  The most significant reduction has been in the crippling rents paid on the premises rented by the company.<\/p><p>It is a sad fact that many commercial landlords here have still not woken up to the truth that they are bringing Irish businesses down by not being prepared to renegotiate leases that have upward-only rent reviews.  The Pamela Scott negotiations only succeeded because of the examinership process.  We could have processes to review upward-only rents without having to go to the expense of going to court.  We saw a similar outcome in the B&amp;amp;Q case where rents were renegotiated and reviewed as part of the examinership process and 640 jobs were saved.  Unfortunately, not all of the jobs were saved because we know that the jobs in Waterford were not.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister fir Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton to again discuss the matter of upward-only rent reviews.  I do not believe the commercial landlords here realise the role that they must play in order to get Irish retailers back on their feet.  They need to get real about their rents.  It is not appropriate that companies must go through a very expensive examinership process in order to achieve this kind of outcome.<\/p> <p> I also ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Education and Skills to come into the Chamber to discuss his Department's findings and the report, School Completers - What's Next?  In particular, I refer to the finding that children who attend fee-paying schools are far more likely to get into third level education.  The good news is more than 50% of all those who exit the secondary school system go on to third level education and a further 28% go on to colleges of further education and training.  In other words, Ireland has a success rate of 75% in respect of its children leaving second level education and going on to higher or further education, as well as to colleges of further education.  However, a highly worrying report was also published today by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  She has outlined the difficulties children in care experience with the educational system.  Were the Minister for Education and Skills to be invited into this House, he should also address the educational outcomes for children in care.  This is because, as Members are aware, two out of every three children who leave the care of the State, the latter having acted <i>in loco parentis<\/i>for them, end up experiencing homelessness within two years.<\/p><p> Finally, Focus Ireland launched its annual report today and I commend it on its work in the areas of preventing homelessness and dealing with those who unfortunately are homeless.  It is a sad fact that the number of people now presenting as homeless in the greater Dublin area has more than doubled within the past 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700004#C00400","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367934300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I call Senator O'Donovan.

First, he rightly identifies that Members really ought to be discussing European legislation and European proposals to a much greater extent.  This latest proposal, which pertains to a directive at European level to harmonise laws to ensure the protection of the euro and other currencies against counterfeiting, is a very good example.  I was actually present at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality the other day.  I was one of only one or two Oireachtas Members present who heard what the Minister, Deputy Shatter, had to say and who discussed it and then participated in questions, in addition to Deputy Alan Farrell, who chaired the meeting and Deputy Finian McGrath, who I believe also had questions.  My point is that it was far from being a thorough scrutiny of the proposal of the kind that might be considered desirable.  There is nothing particularly controversial in the proposal, although there are issues, for example, in respect of surveillance and the possibility of certain minimum sentencing for such offences, which is not something that would sit well in this jurisdiction.  Members had a very interesting discussion, in so far as it went, but it would be entirely appropriate for Members of these Houses, and of this House in particular, to engage in further scrutiny of such a proposal and I second what Senator Byrne had to say in this regard.<\/p><p>  He also called for the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to come to this House and I also would like him to come in, albeit for another reason.  In last Friday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, it was reported that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, stated the reason Fine Gael was forced to change its position on abortion - its original promise being that it would not legislate for abortion - was following a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights after the election, which the Minister stated required the Government to then legislate for the existing constitutional position.  The entire thrust of the article in the<i> Irish Independent<\/i> is that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, was stating that Fine Gael had its election promises and then came a European court decision.  The only problem is the European Court decision in question came in December 2010, that is, three months before the election.  The promise given by Fine Gael was on the back of the Strasbourg court decision and Fine Gael, under the guidance of the now Minister, Deputy Hogan, gave clear commitments.  This raises the question as to whether the Government is playing games with the truth in this regard.  Is it about making it up as one goes along?<\/p><p>  I must be fair to the Minister, who approached me in the corridor just now.  I will conclude very shortly but this is an important point.  He approached me in the corridor just now to say he had heard from the Chief Whip that I was raising a question.  He then gave me an explanation which, frankly, I did not understand because it is quite clear, from the article in Friday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, that the Minister was giving the journalists to understand there was an election commitment and then there was a court decision.  However, that is not how it happened and the Minister should know that.  I will not accuse the Minister of lying but someone advising the Minister or perhaps the Minister himself gave a journalist a version of events that cannot be in concordance with the truth.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the Leader will ask the Minister to come in and be accountable to this House, even if the media is so far not holding him to account, for what he said, what he meant, whether the Government is making up excuses as it goes along and whether the truth matters a damn to it at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700005#D00500","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Listening to Senator Mullen, I am reminded what I used to be told going out to play football with the Geraldines: \"If you cannot get the ball, get the man.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00200","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>We want the man in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00300","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>That is the way they play it up in Louth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00400","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":24,"content":"<p>We never did that.

Speaking on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; on RTE, she said it was unacceptable there is no information on the educational outcomes of children in care.  Ms Logan outlined the need to gather data on these children.  Children in care often have multiple placements, meaning they change school often.  I agree with Ms Logan that we must have a tracking system for the educational outcomes for children in care.  Further to Senator Hayden's remarks, I propose that we invite the Ombudsman for Children to the House to further educate us on her concerns and the need to gather data on these vulnerable children in order that we can help them to achieve their potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00500","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":25,"content":"<p>The Senator can take that matter up with the leader of his group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I second Senator Byrne's amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00700","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>It was seconded by Senator Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00800","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":28,"content":"<p>It has not been seconded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E00900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I am glad the Cathaoirleach has corrected the Fine Gael Whip and put him in his place for a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E01000","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700006#E01100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1367934900,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I agree completely with Senator Byrne, and I am entitled to say that because I am spokesman on European affairs and it is Europe week, a very significant week in the Oireachtas.

The Senator makes a very interesting observation, one which I would make about the Iona Institute.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  Today, we heard another example of a distinguished medical person - in this case Professor David Fergusson from New Zealand - distancing himself from the use the Iona Institute and others, including Members of the House, made of his research.  Professor Fergusson stated his research had been used in a misleading manner.  I hope those who so used it will withdraw their comments.  This is the third or fourth time the Iona Institute has been caught misusing scientific research and it finds itself in the awkward position of having the authors of various scientific papers disassociating themselves from such use.<\/p> <p>It raises a number of questions about the relationship this self-appointed group has with integrity, truth and understanding.<\/p><p>I am not impugning any motives on anybody's part but if one looks at what happened the last time in respect of putting Article 40.3.3&deg; into the Constitution, which was completely sectarian and opposed by leading members of my church, it established the theological position of one dominant faith and had extraordinary unintended consequences, as theologians would say.  I was very surprised there was no term or time-line offered for the date within a pregnancy up to which a termination could ensue.  I discovered this was because of the wording of Article 40.3.3&deg;.  We are almost unique in the world in having this situation which, no doubt, is as a result of the well-intentioned meddling of people who did not know what they were talking about.<\/p><p>I refer, in conclusion, to the possibility of excommunication, which is a separation from the sacraments, the body of Christ and all the rest of it.  This is very serious and it is regrettable that Cardinal Brady is the person who took this step.  Whatever about that, to do that to a politician, any politician, who acts in conscience and in line with the law, is extraordinary.  We should be very careful about this.  In 2009, a nine year old girl in Brazil, pregnant as a result of incest, was taken by her parents to have an abortion because her pathetic, childish, little body could not tolerate giving birth.  For doing that, she and her entire family were excommunicated by the local archbishop.  That is completely unChristian and I hope that nothing even remotely approaching this will happen here in either personal or political life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700007#F01500","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367935800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>All of us in the Seanad speak about the importance of European legislation but we must also remember that 96% of legislation made in Ireland comes from Europe.

The aspect which would concern me is that in contrast with Finland, we do not tie the qualifications of teachers to the subjects they teach.  The step up from second level to third level, on which the Minister has reported, is difficult but to try to go from a subject where the teacher does not have a qualification in his or her degree to third level is an impossible gap to bridge and that should form part of the discussion.

I call on the Leader to facilitate at some stage before the end of term a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport specifically on activity and inclusion of people with disabilities in all sports.  I note the fact that several million euro have been made available in the past 18 months to upgrade swimming pools throughout the country to make them accessible to people with disabilities.  Before the end of term I hope to have representatives from the Cara APA Centre at the Institution of Technology in Tralee make a presentation here on its worldwide ground-breaking research on the inclusivity of people with physical disabilities in sport.  I also hope to facilitate a presentation in the audiovisual room from the three main sporting organisations in the country, the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU, on the significant behind-the-scenes work they are doing to encourage the various units of their organisations to engage with people with disabilities and facilitate equal access to sport.<\/p><p>The health of our nation is remarkably important and the health and physical activity of people with disabilities is an area that needs to be further developed.  It needs resources to be channelled by central government.

There is a deadline of 15 May for putting in place a fire and building safety plan to which government, unions and employers are signing up.  It is essential that Irish retailers which operate on our high streets sign up to that agreement.  All of them are active in the Single European Market.  The conditions in the factory are of huge concern.  As customers, we have an obligation to put pressure on the stores to which we give our custom.  We should keep pressure on them to ensure they sign up to the agreement to which I referred, and that they sign up to ethical trading and sustainable employment conditions for those working in the factories.  As politicians, we need to keep this issue on the agenda at national and European levels.

For this process, the Minister is the regulator and will remain the regulator until the new office is established.  As I indicated, the original Government decision on the approach to the next lotto licence was formulated at the end of 2011.  We have given a great deal of consideration to all the component parts.  Members acknowledged that on the last occasion I was in the House.  They have not always agreed with the conclusions we have arrived at, but it was acknowledged that a great deal of thought has gone into the structure of the licensing arrangement.  It was considered that for the purposes of the next lotto licence a better outcome could be achieved if the Office of the regulator was an independent body, separate from Government.  While there are differing views on the experience of regulatory regimes, there is no doubt some have been more successful than others.  As I indicated on the last occasion, often that is due partly to the way the terms of reference given to the regulator are framed by Government.<\/p> <p>This is a modest proposal and it will be a modest office.  It will be better not to have a career civil servant doing the job on a part-time basis, although this was a suggestion which was reasonably made, to ensure all the games are robust and the numerous licensing arrangements are adequately policed because it is a very extensive business of the order of &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million per annum, and hopefully it will grow a bit more than this.  As I indicated, the legislation makes the regulator accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The regulator can be brought in and questioned and this is a better way.  A regulator is much more open to having this type of discussion with a committee than a civil servant might be.  The Senator might be interested to know we are also preparing new working arrangements for civil servants to make them more accountable and free them from some of the constraints in their way to interact with committees of the Houses.  This is something I want to do separately.<\/p><p>The Bill provides that the regulator's office will be fully funded by the proceeds of the lotto so there will be no Exchequer cost.  It will be a modest office.  Even after the enactment of legislation the Minister will determine the number of staff and their remuneration and conditions.  There will be no incentive for the empire to grow.  As I indicated, it is not directly pertinent to this legislation but Senators expressed the view there is a much broader question of the regulation of gambling which needs to be addressed.  I hope this modest proposal for a regulator for the lotto might migrate into having wider functions, but I do not want to trespass on the turf of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, who I understand will bring general gambling legislation and co-ordination before the Houses before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700017#Q00900","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367939700,"counter":149,"content":"<p>Another area in which I have expertise, or some involvement, relates to premium rate telephone calls.

I believe this to be the fifth time I have been in this House to discuss the lottery.  While there are a great many highly significant issues under my Department's remit, it is interesting that this matter has taken a considerable time.  I commend people on that, as it is important that due diligence be done.  In addition, the last time I was in this Chamber, someone mentioned passion and I am all in favour of it.  It is a good thing for people to feel strongly about any issue.  It is important, as it does not happen often enough that people would argue their case.  While I do not wish to take up Members' time, I have laid out what must be done and perhaps I might make a few small reports to the House?  In respect of the children's hospital, the timescale for its construction has moved out more than the Government had expected.  I had hoped there would be a juxtaposition of the sale of the lottery licence, the payment of an upfront cash amount to the State and the construction.  However, that is not going to happen quite as serendipitously or in as dovetailed a fashion as I originally had envisaged.  Nevertheless, periodic reports are now coming to the Cabinet on the phasing of the national children's hospital, which I believe will be a flagship project.<\/p> <p> I said previously that I am committed, once the sale is completed and money is allocated to the State, to depositing the money.  In the other House there was a strong view, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il in this House, that it must be clear the money would be deposited somewhere and not dissipated away from the children's hospital.  I said I would come back once we had determined the sum of money and explain how that would happen.<\/p><p> We differed about the regulator but we made our points.  A number of Members talked about expressions of interest.  I have stayed away from all of that area and I set up a protocol in the beginning for the sale of State assets.  I have not been involved and I have not received any representations for it.  I read the newspapers, however, and I saw today in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that there is one significant international company hoping to make a joint bid with An Post.  I heard from a Seanad colleague today that another domestic bid is coming.  Perhaps there will be a number of bids.<\/p><p> Senator O'Donnell is right; this is a balancing act and it is not my intention to maximise the upfront payment at the cost of not having a regulated lottery.  The lottery is regulated so there is a cost to be paid for that which I am willing to recommend to the House rather than having an open-ended bid for money.  On balance, I think this is right.<\/p><p> Senators are aware there are limited online sales for the current lottery.  That is how we will migrate, with most of our business being done online over the next 20 years.  It would be appropriate to provide the facility for the lottery to do it.<\/p><p> I do not want to end in a discordant fashion but there has been much debate about whether the sale of State assets was included in the original troika agreement.  The original troika agreement stated the Government would consider the report of the then ongoing McCarthy report.  At my first meeting with the troika after the Government was formed, it was strongly of the view and understood a quantum of &euro;5 billion of State assets would be sold.  The agreement in the programme for Government is a considerably lesser sum but the key is we sell nothing that is strategic.  We can debate what is strategic and what is not but the items that are in line for sales, as I indicated last week, are non-strategic in my judgment.

In its annual report on the operation of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 20 July 2012, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs recommended that sectoral committees should identify on an annual basis those legislative and non-legislative proposals from the European Commission's annual work programme, which it would subject to detailed scrutiny and that these would be forwarded to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs for inclusion in an agreed list of priorities.  The joint committee would then report to the Houses on an agreed list of priorities, which should be adopted by motion of both Houses as the Oireachtas EU scrutiny work programme.<\/p><p>  This is the first such Oireachtas EU scrutiny work programme prepared following that recommendation.  Each of the sectoral committees discussed and identified their own priorities from the European Commission's annual work programme 2013.<\/p> <p>This work programme, which the Seanad as well as the D&aacute;il has been asked to adopt, represents all the priorities already identified by the relevant joint committees into which Senators have had input as members of the relevant sectoral committees.<\/p><p>The Commission's work programme is aspirational and most of the proposals have not yet been published but will be during the year and they will be considered by the joint Oireachtas committee at that point.  The idea behind a prioritised work programme is that it helps to differentiate major policy issues and legislative proposals from less important or technical ones, as there can be up to 500 legislative proposals in any one year.  It also assists committees in considering issues earlier in the legislative cycle, thereby improving the capacity of the Parliament and committees to shape and influence the formal legislative measure when it is first published.<\/p><p>The reason for putting the work programme before both Houses is that it is then an Oireachtas work programme rather than individual committees' work programmes, thus giving it a greater status.  It also informs Members in good time of the range of important EU proposals which are coming down the track.<\/p><p>As I informed the House last year, the Seanad sought extra resources to deal with an EU work programme but they were not granted.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is bringing this motion forward to allow it to scrutinise EU legislation in a far greater way and at an earlier stage than was the case previously.  The motion will allow the EU work programme to be dealt with by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and I commend it to the House.<\/p><p>However, there are other areas in which the Seanad should be involved outside the parameters of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  We certainly do not want duplication, that is, this committee doing something which the House intends to do.  However, this committee is charged with this task at this point.<\/p><p>As many of the MEPs who spoke to us over the past number of weeks suggested, we could have a significant input into European affairs outside the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union  Affairs.  Perhaps sooner rather than later, we should appoint a sub-committee to bring a proposal to the Seanad to examine the types of proposals necessary in EU legislation that it can deal with outside the remit of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  <\/p><p>As I said, I do not want duplication but I commend the motion.  Greater scrutiny of EU legislation by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is to be welcomed but the Seanad should have a greater role in European affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700022#X01200","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367941500,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I commend the Leader for allowing a short debate on this motion, which we support.  There was no question of us not supporting this good motion that Seanad &Eacute;ireann adopts the EU scrutiny work programme 2013, joint committees' priorities, which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 2 May 2013 by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which I am a member.  I commend the work on putting this together.<\/p><p>In regard to the Lisbon treaty, I am not sure whether it really envisaged that joint committees would replace the work of either House of the Oireachtas.  This states that they would take on the remit in regard to subsidiarity.  I presume that is the case and that authority must have been designated to the  committees.  <\/p> <p>There has not yet been an occasion in which legislation was referred to other parliaments or opposed by the D&aacute;il, Seanad or a joint committee thereof.  That is surprising, because although the legislative proposals concerned were possibly not contentious, it is unlikely that legislation is never controversial.  Some of the proposals deal with important matters.  For example, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine is considering the framework for organic production.  The production and sale of organic products certainly requires European scrutiny and support, although standards are generally maintained through self-regulation by an organisation that sets standards for organic farms.  In the event of the Taoiseach successfully introducing an amendment to the Constitution to abolish this House, the committees will be much reduced in size.  The current structure of joint committees comprising Members drawn from both Houses allows a wide range of knowledge and views to be shared.  It would be regrettable if that level of knowledge was no longer available.  It will be up to the electorate to decide whether the Seanad, reformed or otherwise, will continue in existence.<\/p><p> The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has an extensive workload but I hope it is able to do more than simply nod through these European proposals.  The Commission and the Council prepare an enormous number of legislative proposals, and the European Parliament is becoming increasingly important in this regard.  I acknowledge that the Leader has done his utmost to ensure legislation is referred to the Seanad as well as to sectoral committees.  The broader remit of this House would allow us to consider the wider ramifications of legislation on, for example, eel fishing, which affects many counties.  A Green Party Minister in the previous Government, Eamon Ryan, abolished eel fishing for a period of 99 years.  The other 26 member states introduced conservation measures but not outright bans on the catching of eels.  Eel fishing was an important industry for this country and we have now been deprived of its benefits because there was not proper scrutiny of the proposal at European Union level or in this Parliament.  The same applies to a proposal on the below cost sale of cigarette products, which should have received closer parliamentary scrutiny than that permitted in a joint committee.<\/p><p> The Leader is correct to establish some sort of <i>modus operandi<\/i>on broader issues, such as combating cigarette smuggling, which could be appropriately considered by this House.  The Seanad comprises representatives of practically every county in Ireland, including Border counties.  For example, County Louth is well represented but the Senators from that county may not be members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  While they are permitted to attend meetings of the committee, they may not always be aware of its agenda.  There is a big difference between attending a committee as a non-member and participating in a debate as a Member of this House.<\/p> <p>It would affect people's attendance at those meetings because they would not be invited as such and they would have to find out for themselves that such legislation is being considered by the joint committee.  When she was on the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny with me, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, was very supportive and has been very supportive in her attendance in the Seanad and in her support for the idea of scrutiny.<\/p><p>I do not believe that we need many additional resources to debate issues in the House.  We can debate these issues in the House and refer to them because the knowledge that is in this House is the equal of any committee advisor.  There are certain areas that we can debate in the House.  If we believe it is worthwhile then we could refer an issue on to other parliaments under a provision of the Lisbon treaty.  Certain advisors to committees could be seconded on a temporary basis as items arise.  This need not be on a full-time, permanent basis but each month when there is an item on the agenda, even if we then refer it to the committee for final scrutiny.  It would be worthwhile to have the observations of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I thank the Leader for allowing a short debate.  It is good to air this issue given that it is Europe week.  It is appropriate that we are having this debate and it was appropriate that the Leader accepted the proposal by Senator Thomas Byrne to have this short debate.  We are not opposing it, we are supporting it.  The views put forward by the Leader are welcome.  Perhaps as a result of this short debate the Leader might consider bringing one or two items onto the legislative framework of the House for a brief debate without any advisors.  Then we could refer our observations to the joint committee or, if we believe it is worthwhile, we could refer them on to Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700023#Y00200","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367942100,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I am in favour of this proposal as put forward by the Leader of the House.  We have the proposal from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on this matter.  It is important that any proposals coming from Europe are highlighted at an early stage here in order that we know what is coming down the road, not only today but what may be coming in the next two or three years.  While joint committees are effective in may ways, some of them have a considerable schedule of work.  This approach is working effectively on European matters in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The whole focus in agriculture is on what is coming down the road under the Common Agricultural Policy proposals and the amendment to and reforms of that policy.<\/p><p>I sit on the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  We have a considerable agenda relating to what is happening in the health care area.  We already sat three full days here in January dealing with one tranche of legislation and we are now facing into another three days.  I imagine there are issues relating to health which are being dealt with at European level that the health committee does not have the time to deal with.<\/p><p>I made a point at the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs today relating to medical devices.  We were to give the stamp of approval to what was being proposed.  I raised a simple question about whether there had been any consultation with the industry involved in manufacturing medical devices.  In fact there had been no consultation and when it was referred to people involved in the industry, they had concerns about what was bring proposed at European level.  This is where the Seanad, as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, could highlight issues and make people aware of them.  People may wish to get involved in their organisations in putting forward their views before they get to the final stages at European level.  This House could be used as an effective mechanism for airing the views of Members and for focusing on and making information available to the public.  I believe the House can be used effectively in this way.  The medical area is vast, in particular the area of how drugs and medications work across 27 member states, as is the area of the development of new drugs to ensure that we have a cost-effective mechanism.<\/p> <p>I have often referred to the huge variation in the price of drugs in Ireland compared with other European countries.  Why should we not focus more on how we can lower prices to what other European countries pay for medication?  It is something on which we need to work.<\/p><p>Another medical issue is research, in terms of a joint approach between member states and the need to work together on certain areas.  It is interesting to note that in the past six weeks, UCC received &euro;6 million from Europe for a research project on health care.  It is not just UCC which is involved.  A number of other countries are also involved in research.  There is a sharing of information in order that research can develop much faster, which is also very important.  The House and the Oireachtas should highlight what is happening in Europe and allow a window of opportunity to be given to people to become aware of what is happening.  It is something for which the House should be used far more effectively.  I agree with Senator Leyden on that matter.<\/p><p>The committee has set out its programme.  I welcome the fact it has highlighted what is on it and that we are all familiar with it.  It is important we support the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013050700025#AA00200","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367942400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I add my voice of support to the motion.
